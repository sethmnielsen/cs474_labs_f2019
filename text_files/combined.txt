 The account of Alma, who was the son of Alma the first, and chief judge over the people of Nephi, and also the high priest over the Church. An account of the reign of the judges, and the wars and contentions among the people. And also an account of a war between the Nephites and the Lamanites, according to the record of Alma, the first and chief judge.

 Nehor, an enemy of the church, slays Gideon, and is brought to judgment and executed--Priestcraft and persecution--Improved conditions--Priests and people equal.

 Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having gone the way of all the earth, having warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless he had established laws, and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide by the laws which he had made.

 And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of Alma in the judgment-seat, there was a man brought before him to be judged, a man who was large, and was noted for his much strength.

 And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.

 And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.

 And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give him money.

 And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a church after the manner of his preaching.

 And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words of God.

 Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an instrument in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage.

 Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him. Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.

 And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be judged according to the crimes which he had committed.

 And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pleaded for himself with much boldness.

 But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that priestcraft has been introduced among this people. And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction.

 And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to spare thee his blood would come upon us for vengeance.

 Therefore thou art condemned to die, according to the law which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been acknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by the law.

 And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was Nehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious death.

 Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft through the land; for there were many who loved the vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false doctrines; and this they did for the sake of riches and honor.

 Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of the law, for liars were punished; therefore they pretended to preach according to their belief; and now the law could have no power on any man for his belief.

 And they durst not steal, for fear of the law, for such were punished; neither durst they rob, nor murder, for he that murdered was punished unto death.

 But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of God began to persecute those that did belong to the church of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.

 Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all manner of words, and this because of their humility; because they were not proud in their own eyes, and because they did impart the word of God, one with another, without money and without price.

 Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.

 Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their fists.

 Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the church.

 For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God. And also many withdrew themselves from among them.

 Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.

 And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God. And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength.

 And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.

 And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.

 And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need--an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.

 And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.

 And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.

 For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.

 And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.

 Amlici seeks to become king--Rejected by the majority, but is made king--He is defeated in battle--He joins the Lamanites--Alma slays Amlici and routs his forces.

 And it came to pass in the commencement of the fifth year of their reign there began to be a contention among the people; for a certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed according to the law--

 Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be a king over the people.

 Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the voice of the people.

 Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God.

 And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves together throughout all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another.

 And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in their voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the judges.

 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Amlici, that he was not made king over the people.

 Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor to anger against those who were not in his favor.

 And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together, and did consecrate Amlici to be their king.

 Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he did that he might subject them to him.

 Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici, being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called Nephites, or the people of God.

 Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons of war, of every kind.

 And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of their coming. And there were appointed captains, and higher captains, and chief captains, according to their numbers.

 And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all manner of weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against their brethren.

 And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites.

 Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the people of Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to battle.

 And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidon. And the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall before the Amlicites.

 Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that they began to flee before them.

 And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all that day, and did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.

 And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in the valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night.

 And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites, that he might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he might guard himself against them, that he might preserve his people from being destroyed.

 Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the Amlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites.

 And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the camp of the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much fear, saying:

 Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our great astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites; and behold, the Amlicites have joined them;

 And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain.

 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their tents, and departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their city, which was the city of Zarahemla.

 And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them.

 Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.

 And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword, face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with another.

 And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, being exercised with much faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and spare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save and preserve this people.

 Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici with the sword.

 And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his guards to contend with Alma.

 But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the king of the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back.

 And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon.

 And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river Sidon that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not be numbered.

 And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness which was west and north, away beyond the borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay them.

 Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until they were scattered on the west, and on the north, until they had reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that part of the wilderness which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts.

 And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their wounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped up on the earth.

 The mark of the Amlicites, and the curse upon the Lamanites--Another Nephite victory.

 And it came to pass that the Nephites who were not slain by the weapons of war, after having buried those who had been slain--now the number of the slain were not numbered, because of the greatness of their number--after they had finished burying their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses, and their wives, and their children.

 Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and also many of their flocks and their herds; and also many of their fields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the hosts of men.

 And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had been slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the waters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the sea, and they are many.

 And the Amlicites were distinguished from the Nephites, for they had marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the manner of the Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like unto the Lamanites.

 Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth.

 And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.

 And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.

 And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.

 And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.

 Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites was called under that head, and there was a mark set upon him.

 And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the tradition of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition of their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the commandments of God and kept them, were called the Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time forth--

 And it is they who have kept the records which are true of their people, and also of the people of the Lamanites.

 Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a mark set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a mark of red upon their foreheads.

 Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them.

 And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.

 And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against thee and thy seed.

 And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be called thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be called thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the promises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed.

 Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the words of God when they began to mark themselves in their foreheads; nevertheless they had come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should fall upon them.

 Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own condemnation.

 Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army met the Amlicites.

 And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them out of their land.

 Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up to battle at this time against the Lamanites;

 But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and slew many of the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them out of the borders of their land.

 And then they returned again and began to establish peace in the land, being troubled no more for a time with their enemies.

 Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and contentions were commenced and ended in the fifth year of the reign of the judges.

 And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards according to their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one.

 For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this according to the words of the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according to the truth. And thus endeth the fifth year of the reign of the judges.

 Growth of the church--Prosperity, pride, and iniquity--Nephihah made chief judge.

 Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor wars in the land of Zarahemla;

 But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.

 And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.

 And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.

 And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.

 And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly apparel.

 Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people.

 For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.

 And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God.

 And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to those who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress.

 And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.

 Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting themselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their backs upon the needy and the naked and those who were hungry, and those who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted.

 Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people, while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner of afflictions, for Christ's sake, who should come according to the spirit of prophecy;

 Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of their sins; being filled with great joy because of the resurrection of the dead, according to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.

 And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all their inequality, began to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.

 And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.

 Now this man's name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.

 Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.

 And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.

 And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy.

 The words which Alma, the High Priest according to the holy order of God, delivered to the people in their cities and villages throughout the land.

 He recounts the experience of the church--Denounces iniquity--Calls upon the people to repent.

 Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land.

 And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:

 I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.

 And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.

 And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.

 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?

 Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.

 And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they were not.

 And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved.

 And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea, what grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the cause of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of hell?

 Behold, I can tell you--did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet? Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?

 And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.

 And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God. And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved.

 And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?

 Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?

 I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?

 Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that day, and say--Lord, our works have been righteous works upon the face of the earth--and that he will save you?

 Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?

 I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?

 I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have yielded yourselves to become subjects to the devil?

 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.

 And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments stained with blood and all manner of filthiness? Behold, what will these things testify against you?

 Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and also that ye are guilty of all manner of wickedness?

 Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose garments are cleansed and are spotless, pure and white?

 I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the children of the kingdom of the devil.

 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?

 Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?

 Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.

 Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.

 And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?

 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!

 Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent, for the Lord God hath spoken it!

 Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.

 Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life freely;

 Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire--

 For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth not good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.

 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice!

 Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.

 And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil.

 For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.

 Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.

 And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.

 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the commandments of God.

 For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the holy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been spoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come.

 And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I know of these things myself? Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true. And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?

 Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.

 And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto me, that the words which have been spoken by our fathers are true, even so according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me, which is also by the manifestation of the Spirit of God.

 I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall say unto you, concerning that which is to come, is true; and I say unto you, that I know that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy, and truth. And behold, it is he that cometh to take away the sins of the world, yea, the sins of every man who steadfastly believeth on his name.

 And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I am called, yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and every one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.

 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God cometh in his glory, in his might, majesty, power, and dominion. Yea, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit saith: Behold the glory of the King of all the earth; and also the King of heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of men.

 And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a mighty voice, saying: Go forth and say unto this people--Repent, for except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of heaven.

 And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is laid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire. Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.

 And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and trample the Holy One under your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing of costly apparel and setting your hearts upon the vain things of the world, upon your riches?

 Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than another; yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your brethren, who humble themselves and do walk after the holy order of God, wherewith they have been brought into this church, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth works which are meet for repentance--

 Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the poor, and the needy, and in withholding your substance from them?

 And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I say unto you that these are they who shall be hewn down and cast into the fire except they speedily repent.

 And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold, their names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the righteous, that the word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;

 For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand. And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.

 For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock? And behold, if a wolf enter his flock doth he not drive him out? Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.

 And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you; and if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you into his fold, and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may not be destroyed.

 And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you.

 I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.

 The reform movement, begun in Zarahemla, is carried to the city of Gideon.

 And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church.

 And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church who repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance, and were received into the church.

 And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not repent of their wickedness and humble themselves before God--I mean those who were lifted up in the pride of their hearts--the same were rejected, and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.

 And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the city of Zarahemla.

 Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was liberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of assembling themselves together to hear the word of God.

 Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather themselves together oft, and join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.

 And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.

 And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church which was established in the valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and the holy order by which he was called. And thus it is written. Amen.

 The words of Alma which he delivered to the people in Gideon, according to his own record.

 His testimony of the Redeemer--he commends the people for their righteousness.

 Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much business that I could not come unto you.

 And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that the judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come unto you.

 And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.

 But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea, hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that they are established again in the way of his righteousness.

 And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading through much affliction and sorrow.

 But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the true and the living God, and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.

 For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all--for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.

 Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case. Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.

 But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying--Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.

 And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.

 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.

 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.

 Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.

 Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness.

 Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.

 And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me.

 And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things? Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the way that I know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of the Spirit which is in me. And now because your faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken, great is my joy.

 For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found that my desires have been gratified.

 For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that ye are making his paths straight.

 I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of his word, that he cannot walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal round.

 And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can filthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is filthy shall remain in his filthiness.

 And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have been received.

 And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.

 And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works.

 And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the holy prophets who have been ever since the world began, having your garments spotless even as their garments are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no more out.

 And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto you according to the Spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul doth exceedingly rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and heed which ye have given unto my word.

 And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess, your women and your children, according to your faith and good works, from this time forth and forever. And thus I have spoken. Amen.

 Alma's success in Melek--The people of Ammonihah cast him out--Comforted by an angel, he returns--Amulek joins him in the ministry--Great power given.

 And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the order of the church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself from the labors which he had performed.

 And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness.

 And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek according to the holy order of God, by which he had been called; and he began to teach the people throughout all the land of Melek.

 And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all the borders of the land which was by the wilderness side. And they were baptized throughout all the land;

 So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and traveled three days' journey on the north of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah.

 Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.

 And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of Ammonihah he began to preach the word of God unto them.

 Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of Alma.

 Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance.

 Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.

 And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.

 Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which was called Aaron.

 And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying:

 Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from him. Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.

 And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will destroy them.

 For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has given unto his people.

 Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah. And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah.

 And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?

 And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.

 And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma.

 And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.

 And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the land.

 And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this land forever.

 But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them concerning their iniquities.

 And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many days.

 And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto the people.

 And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their iniquities.

 And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people, saying--Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away.

 And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost.

 And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and cast into prison. Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.

 And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had given them.

 The words of Alma, and also the words of Amulek, which were declared unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah. And also they are cast into prison, and delivered by the miraculous power of God which was in them, according to the record of Alma. Comprising chapters 9 to 14 inclusive.

 Alma preaches to the people of Ammonihah and calls them to repentance--His testimony rejected.

 And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying:

 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?

 Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not that the earth should pass away.

 And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day.

 Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.

 And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things?

 And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did not. And I stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:

 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments of God.

 Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of Jerusalem by the hand of God? Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through the wilderness?

 And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?

 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe.

 Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this is not all--he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away.

 Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land? And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

 Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land.

 Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent.

 For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land.

 And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who call on his name.

 But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce anger of the Lord.

 For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to destroy his people. I say unto you, Nay; he would rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after having had so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God;

 Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea, after having been favored above every other nation, kindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made known unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which is to come;

 Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of translation;

 Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of things--

 And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them.

 For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth?

 And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;

 And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people and to answer their prayers.

 And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his name.

 Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they have been--if they have been righteous they shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil.

 Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people.

 And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are meet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost and a fallen people.

 Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.

 And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a fallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison.

 But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they should take me at that time and cast me into prison.

 And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to preach unto them also. And now the words of Amulek are not all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book.

 Amulek's lineage--Lehi a descendant of Joseph through Manasseh--Amulek tells of his conversion--His testimony--He denounces designing lawyers and judges--Zeezrom.

 Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:

 I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was that same Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God.

 And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the hands of his brethren.

 And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry.

 Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.

 Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges.

 As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house.

 And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house. And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house--and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.

 And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.

 And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house.

 For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.

 And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.

 Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them.

 Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges.

 Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession.

 And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak.

 Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God.

 Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people.

 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices--yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction.

 And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

 Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come down among my people, with equity and justice in my hands.

 Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.

 But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent.

 And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected.

 But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, according to their truth?

 For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not understand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation.

 And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges.

 And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And now he says that he has not spoken against it.

 And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.

 And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things against him.

 And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people.

 Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their employ.

 Judges and their compensation--Nephite coins and measures--Zeezrom confounded by Amulek.

 Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should receive wages according to the time which they labored to judge those who were brought before them to be judged.

 Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he did owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber.

 And the judge received for his wages according to his time--a senine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold; and this is according to the law which was given.

 Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold, and of their silver, according to their value. And the names are given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges, they having been established by king Mosiah.

 Now the reckoning is thus--a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold.

 A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver.

 A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either for a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of grain.

 Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.

 And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.

 And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.

 And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.

 And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.

 And an onti was as great as them all.

 Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning--

 A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a measure of barley.

 And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.

 And a leah is the half of a shiblum.

 Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.

 Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.

 Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they received their wages according to their employ, therefore, they did stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ, that they might get money according to the suits which were brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek.

 And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?

 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.

 Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me? Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?

 Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more than him.

 And now thou hast lied before God unto me. Thou saidst unto me--Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto thee--when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true and living God, that thou mightest have cause to destroy me. And now behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy reward.

 And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living God?

 And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.

 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?

 And he answered, No.

 Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these things?

 And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me.

 And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son of God?

 And he said unto him, Yea.

 And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word.

 Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people--as though he had authority to command God.

 Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he shall not save his people in their sins.

 And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.

 Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?

 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;

 And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.

 Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works.

 Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death.

 The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.

 Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.

 Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body. I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.

 Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble. And thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have written.

 Amulek's testimony confirmed by Alma--Doctrine of the tree of life--The plan of redemption expounded.

 Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his lying and deceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble under a consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that which Amulek had done.

 Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the people round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on this wise:

 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;

 And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this people that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us out--

 Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee. Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto thee I say unto all.

 And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.

 Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.

 And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be judged according to their works?

 And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.

 And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.

 And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.

 And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being brought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our works.

 Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.

 For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.

 But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.

 And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.

 Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.

 Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God's justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption.

 Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking these words, the people began to be more astonished;

 But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, came forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an immortal state, that the soul can never die?

 What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever? And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.

 Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.

 And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.

 And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.

 Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.

 And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would have been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none effect.

 But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.

 And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto them;

 Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory.

 And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works.

 Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first transgressed the first commandments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good--

 Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme goodness of God.

 But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being the plan of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;

 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest.

 And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest.

 And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will harden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his wrath upon you as in the first provocation, yea, according to his word in the last provocation as well as the first, to the everlasting destruction of your souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the last death, as well as the first.

 And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us in these his second commandments which he has given unto us; but let us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared according to his word.

 Alma's discourse continued--The holy order of the Son of God--High Priests--Why ordained--Melchizedek and Abraham.

 And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.

 And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption.

 And this is the manner after which they were ordained--being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such.

 And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren.

 Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world for such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared--

 And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter into his rest--

 This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of all things--

 Now they were ordained after this manner--being called with a holy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and high priesthood, is without beginning or end--

 Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is. Amen.

 Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood, there were many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;

 Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were sanctified, and their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb.

 Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and there were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God.

 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before God, and bring forth fruit meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into that rest.

 Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek, who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood forever.

 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed.

 Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.

 Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness;

 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.

 Now, there were many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but none were greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made mention.

 Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice. Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest them it shall be to your own destruction.

 And now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words unto them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a mighty voice, saying: Now is the time to repent, for the day of salvation draweth nigh;

 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.

 And they are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.

 For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory.

 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we know not how soon. Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.

 And it shall be made known unto just and holy men, by the mouth of angels, at the time of his coming, that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled, according to that which they have spoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.

 And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance;

 But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering;

 Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest.

 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by the chains of hell, that ye may not suffer the second death.

 And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not written in this book.

 Alma and Amulek imprisoned--their adherents persecuted--Deaths by fire--Zeezrom, now repentant, pleads their cause and is cast out--The prophets delivered and their enemies slain.

 And it came to pass after he had made an end of speaking unto the people many of them did believe on his words, and began to repent, and to search the scriptures.

 But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the plainness of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had lied unto them, and had reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges.

 And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they had testified so plainly against their wickedness, they sought to put them away privily.

 But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and bound them with strong cords, and took them before the chief judge of the land.

 And the people went forth and witnessed against them--testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should not save them; and many such things did the people testify against Alma and Amulek. Now this was done before the chief judge of the land.

 And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his lying words; and his soul began to be harrowed up under a consciousness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the pains of hell.

 And it came to pass that he began to cry unto the people, saying: Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before God. And he began to plead for them from that time forth; but they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil? And they spit upon him, and cast him out from among them, and also all those who believed in the words which had been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at them.

 And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire; and they also brought forth their records which contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be burned and destroyed by fire.

 And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.

 And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.

 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.

 Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they will burn us also.

 And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord. But, behold, our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.

 Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had been cast into the fire were consumed, and also the records which were cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon their cheeks, and said unto them: After what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone?

 Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith. And the judge smote them again upon their cheeks, and asked: What say ye for yourselves?

 Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew Gideon.

 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him nothing; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast into prison.

 And when they had been cast into prison three days, there came many lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the prison to see them, and they questioned them about many words; but they answered them nothing.

 And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames? And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.

 And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks. And many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn our law? If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver yourselves?

 And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we look when we are damned?

 And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days. And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound with strong cords, and confined in prison.

 And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of their teachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison where Alma and Amulek were bound with cords.

 And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again, and said unto them: If ye have the power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people according to your words.

 And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet.

 And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them.

 And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.

 And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power, according to their faith which was in Christ. And they straightway came forth out of the prison; and they were loosed from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and every soul within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city.

 Now the people having heard a great noise came running together by multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek coming forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had fallen to the earth, they were struck with great fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even as a goat fleeth with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee from the presence of Alma and Amulek.

 Zeezrom, miraculously healed, joins the church and preaches--Many baptized--Alma and Amulek return to Zarahemla.

 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to depart out of that city; and they departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found all the people who had departed out of the land of Ammonihah, who had been cast out and stoned, because they believed in the words of Alma.

 And they related unto them all that had happened unto their wives and children, and also concerning themselves, and of their power of deliverance.

 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which was caused by the great tribulations of his mind on account of his wickedness, for he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no more; and he supposed that they had been slain because of his iniquity. And this great sin, and his many other sins, did harrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having no deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning heat.

 Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of Sidom, his heart began to take courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him.

 And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the message which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the house unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed, sick, being very low with a burning fever; and his mind also was exceedingly sore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him.

 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand: Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?

 And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the words that thou hast taught.

 And Alma said: If thou believest in the redemption of Christ thou canst be healed.

 And he said: Yea, I believe according to thy words.

 And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have mercy on this man, and heal him according to his faith which is in Christ.

 And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom leaped upon his feet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great astonishment of all the people; and the knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land of Sidom.

 And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from that time forth to preach unto the people.

 And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and consecrated priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the Lord whosoever were desirous to be baptized.

 And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock in from all the region round about Sidom, and were baptized.

 But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of Nehor, and did not believe in the repentance of their sins.

 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having forsaken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which were in the land of Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being rejected by those who were once his friends and also by his father and his kindred;

 Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom, seeing a great check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as to the pride of their hearts, and began to humble themselves before God, and began to assemble themselves together at their sanctuaries to worship God before the altar, watching and praying continually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and from death, and from destruction--

 Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore he took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord.

 And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 A cry of war--The wicked city Ammonihah destroyed by Lamanites--Zoram and his sons rout the enemy--Desolation of Nehors--The church widely established.

 And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there having been much peace in the land of Zarahemla, there having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of years, even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the land.

 For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the wilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city of Ammonihah, and began to slay the people and destroy the city.

 And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a sufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had destroyed the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, and also some around the borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the wilderness.

 Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain those who had been carried away captive into the wilderness.

 Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi and Aha)--now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was high priest over the church, and having heard that he had the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went unto him and desired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go into the wilderness in search of their brethren, who had been taken captive by the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the Lamanites will cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up beyond the borders of the land of Manti. And behold there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon, and there the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren who have been taken captive by the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the river Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond the borders of Manti into the south wilderness, which was on the east side of the river Sidon.

 And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren who had been taken captive by the Lamanites, and there was not one soul of them had been lost that were taken captive. And they were brought by their brethren to possess their own lands.

 And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites having been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites was destroyed, and also their great city, which they said God could not destroy, because of its greatness.

 But behold, in one day it was left desolate; and the carcasses were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness.

 Nevertheless, after many days their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years. And it was called Desolation of Nehors; for they were of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands remained desolate.

 And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. And thus for three years did the people of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.

 And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews.

 And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart the word of God, without any respect of persons, continually.

 And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who had been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all the land. And the establishment of the church became general throughout the land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.

 And there was no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out his Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of the children of men, or to prepare their hearts to receive the word which should be taught among them at the time of his coming--

 That they might not be hardened against the word, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they might receive the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true vine, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord their God.

 Now those priests who did go forth among the people did preach against all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering, murdering, committing adultery, and all manner of lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be--

 Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding forth the coming of the Son of God, his sufferings and death, and also the resurrection of the dead.

 And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would appear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness.

 And now after the church had been established throughout all the land--having got the victory over the devil, and the word of God being preached in its purity in all the land, and the Lord pouring out his blessings upon the people--thus ended the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 An account of the sons of Mosiah, who rejected their rights to the kingdom for the word of God, and went up to the land of Nephi to preach to the Lamanites; their sufferings and deliverance--according to the record of Alma. Comprising chapters 17 to 26 inclusive.

 Ammon in the land of Ishmael--he becomes a servant to king Lamoni--His heroic defense of the king's flocks.

 And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.

 Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.

 But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.

 And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much success in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and confess their sins before him.

 Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much labor in the spirit.

 Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their father, Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having refused the kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them, and also this was the minds of the people;

 Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their arrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might provide food for themselves while in the wilderness.

 And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers which they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach the word of God unto the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.

 And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and said unto them: Be comforted. And they were comforted.

 And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.

 And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.

 And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their harvest; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken.

 And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering, that they might not labor for them with their own hands.

 Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers; notwithstanding the promises of the Lord were extended unto them on the conditions of repentance.

 Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption.

 Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and went forth among them, every man alone, according to the word and power of God which was given unto him.

 Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did administer unto them, and he departed from them, after having blessed them according to their several stations, having imparted the word of God unto them, or administered unto them before his departure; and thus they took their several journeys throughout the land.

 And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called after the sons of Ishmael, who also became Lamanites.

 And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and bound him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.

 And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael.

 And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people.

 And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.

 And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife.

 But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites.

 And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as he was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their flocks to the place of water, which was called the water of Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that they may have water--

 Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and scattered the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.

 Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these men. And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered already.

 Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words.

 And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.

 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us.

 And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather them together again to the place of water.

 And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon said unto his brethren: Encircle the flocks round about that they flee not; and I go and contend with these men who do scatter our flocks.

 Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth and stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in number not a few.

 Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of their men could slay him according to their pleasure, for they knew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver his sons out of their hands; neither did they know anything concerning the Lord; therefore they delighted in the destruction of their brethren; and for this cause they stood to scatter the flocks of the king.

 But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain number of them insomuch that they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were angry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they could not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him.

 But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch that they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they were not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm.

 Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it were their leader with his sword; and he smote off as many of their arms as were lifted against him, and they were not a few.

 And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they watered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the king, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony of the things which they had done.

 King Lamoni mistakes Ammon for the Great Spirit--He is taught concerning the true God--Is overcome by the Spirit of the Lord.

 And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants should stand forth and testify to all the things which they had seen concerning the matter.

 And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man. Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?

 And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they scatter the king's flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king. And now, O king, we do not believe that a man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.

 And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at this time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I did your brethren. Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our fathers have spoken.

 Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from his father, that there was a Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they believed in a Great Spirit, they supposed that whatsoever they did was right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his servants;

 For he had slain many of them because their brethren had scattered their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because they had had their flocks scattered they were slain.

 Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the waters of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby they might drive away many that were scattered unto their own land, it being a practice of plunder among them.

 And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying: Where is this man that has such great power?

 And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there had been a great feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.

 Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his chariots he was more astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them.

 Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.

 And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; therefore he was about to return out of his presence.

 And one of the king's servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which is, being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their kings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay.

 Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king? And the king answered him not for the space of an hour, according to their time, for he knew not what he should say unto him.

 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What desirest thou of me? But the king answered him not.

 And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the Spirit of God, therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king. And he said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and slew seven of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvelings?

 I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great? Behold, I am a man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is right, that will I do.

 Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again, for he beheld that Ammon could discern his thoughts; but notwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows all things?

 Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.

 And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart? Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my flocks--

 And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.

 Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things? And this is the thing that I desire of thee.

 And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all thy words. And thus he was caught with guile.

 And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?

 And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that meaneth.

 And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great Spirit?

 And he said, Yea.

 And Ammon said: This is God. And Ammon said unto him again: Believest thou that this Great Spirit, who is God, created all things which are in heaven and in the earth?

 And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which are in the earth; but I do not know the heavens.

 And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God dwells and all his holy angels.

 And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth?

 And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning.

 And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou hast spoken. Art thou sent from God?

 Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was created after the image of God, and I am called by his Holy Spirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be brought to a knowledge of that which is just and true;

 And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God.

 Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the prophets, even down to the time that their father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.

 And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the king and to his servants) all the journeyings of their fathers in the wilderness, and all their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their travail, and so forth.

 And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all their rebellions did he relate unto them; and he expounded unto them all the records and scriptures from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem down to the present time.

 But this is not all; for he expounded unto them the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world; and he also made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and all the works of the Lord did he make known unto them.

 And it came to pass that after he had said all these things, and expounded them to the king, that the king believed all his words.

 And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; according to thy abundant mercy which thou hast had upon the people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people.

 And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he were dead.

 And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried him in unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead for the space of two days and two nights; and his wife, and his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after the manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his loss.

 A wonderful conversion--Abish the Lamanite woman--Lamanite king and queen espouse the faith--Ammon establishes the church in Ishmael.

 And it came to pass that after two days and two nights they were about to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre, which they had made for the purpose of burying their dead.

 Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she sent and desired that he should come in unto her.

 And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and went in unto the queen, and desired to know what she would that he should do.

 And she said unto him: The servants of my husband have made it known unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that thou hast power to do many mighty works in his name;

 Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the space of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not dead, but others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he doth not stink.

 Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was under the power of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God, which was a marvelous light of his goodness--yea, this light had infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having been dispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in his soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame, and he was carried away in God--

 Therefore, what the queen desired of him was his only desire. Therefore, he went in to see the king according as the queen had desired him; and he saw the king, and he knew that he was not dead.

 And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but he sleepeth in God, and on the morrow he shall rise again; therefore bury him not.

 And Ammon said unto her: Believest thou this? And she said unto him: I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of our servants; nevertheless I believe that it shall be according as thou hast said.

 And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such great faith among all the people of the Nephites.

 And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her husband, from that time even until that time on the morrow which Ammon had appointed that he should rise.

 And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words of Ammon; and as he arose, he stretched forth his hand unto the woman, and said: Blessed be the name of God, and blessed art thou.

 For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name. Now, when he had said these words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered by the Spirit.

 Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out according to his prayers upon the Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the cause of so much mourning among the Nephites, or among all the people of God because of their iniquities and their traditions, he fell upon his knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God for what he had done for his brethren; and he was also overpowered with joy; and thus they all three had sunk to the earth.

 Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had fallen, they also began to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them also, for it was they who had stood before the king and testified unto him concerning the great power of Ammon.

 And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the Lord, in their might, even until they had all fallen to the earth, save it were one of the Lamanitish women, whose name was Abish, she having been converted unto the Lord for many years, on account of a remarkable vision of her father--

 Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having made it known, therefore, when she saw that all the servants of Lamoni had fallen to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the king, and Ammon lay prostrate upon the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and supposing that this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened among them, that by beholding this scene it would cause them to believe in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the people.

 And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house of the king. And there came a multitude, and to their astonishment, they beheld the king, and the queen, and their servants prostrate upon the earth, and they all lay there as though they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold, he was a Nephite.

 And now the people began to murmur among themselves; some saying that it was a great evil that had come upon them, or upon the king and his house, because he had suffered that the Nephite should remain in the land.

 But others rebuked them, saying: The king hath brought this evil upon his house, because he slew his servants who had had their flocks scattered at the waters of Sebus.

 And they were also rebuked by those men who had stood at the waters of Sebus and scattered the flocks which belonged to the king, for they were angry with Ammon because of the number which he had slain of their brethren at the waters of Sebus, while defending the flocks of the king.

 Now, one of them, whose brother had been slain with the sword of Ammon, being exceedingly angry with Ammon, drew his sword and went forth that he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and as he lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell dead.

 Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for the Lord had said unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be unto him according to thy faith--therefore, Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord.

 And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the man had fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, fear came upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to touch him or any of those who had fallen; and they began to marvel again among themselves what could be the cause of this great power, or what all these things could mean.

 And it came to pass that there were many among them who said that Ammon was the Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by the Great Spirit;

 But others rebuked them all, saying that he was a monster, who had been sent from the Nephites to torment them.

 And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great Spirit to afflict them because of their iniquities; and that it was the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said that it was this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of their brethren, the Lamanites.

 And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among them. And while they were thus contending, the woman servant who had caused the multitude to be gathered together came, and when she saw the contention which was among the multitude she was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears.

 And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the hand, that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as soon as she touched her hand she arose and stood upon her feet, and cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have mercy on this people!

 And when she had said this, she clasped her hands, being filled with joy, speaking many words which were not understood; and when she had done this, she took the king, Lamoni, by the hand, and behold he arose and stood upon his feet.

 And he, immediately, seeing the contention among his people, went forth and began to rebuke them, and to teach them the words which he had heard from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as heard his words believed, and were converted unto the Lord.

 But there were many among them who would not hear his words; therefore they went their way.

 And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also administered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and they did all declare unto the people the selfsame thing--that their hearts had been changed; that they had no more desire to do evil.

 And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had seen angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told them things of God, and of his righteousness.

 And it came to pass that there were many that did believe in their words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they became a righteous people, and they did establish a church among them.

 And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his Spirit upon them; and we see that his arm is extended to all people who will repent and believe on his name.

 Ammon and king Lamoni journey to Middoni--they meet Lamoni's father who is king over all the land--Hostile at first, he relents, and grants great favors.

 And it came to pass that when they had established a church in that land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father.

 And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.

 Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he said unto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I go that I may deliver them.

 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the Lord thou canst do all things. But behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and he will cast thy brethren out of prison. Now Lamoni said unto him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?

 And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and he said unto me--Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of Middoni.

 Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants should make ready his horses and his chariots.

 And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the land of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he will cast thy brethren out of prison.

 And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni were journeying thither, they met the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.

 And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye not come to the feast on that great day when I made a feast unto my sons, and unto my people?

 And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, who is one of the children of a liar?

 And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he was going, for he feared to offend him.

 And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own kingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he had prepared.

 And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold, to his astonishment, his father was angry with him, and said: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, who are sons of a liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his children are also come amongst us that they may, by their cunning and their lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our property.

 Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay Ammon with the sword. And he also commanded him that he should not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him to the land of Ishmael.

 But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will I return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni that I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are just men and holy prophets of the true God.

 Now when his father had heard these words, he was angry with him, and he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.

 But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt not slay thy son; nevertheless, it were better that he should fall than thee, for behold, he has repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul could not be saved.

 And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if thou shouldst slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood would cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul.

 Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him, saying: I know that if I should slay my son, that I should shed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him.

 And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon. But Ammon withstood his blows, and also smote his arm that he could not use it.

 Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to plead with Ammon that he would spare his life.

 But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will smite thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be cast out of prison.

 Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare me I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half of the kingdom.

 Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him, but grant that he may do according to his own desires in whatsoever thing he thinketh, then will I spare thee; otherwise I will smite thee to the earth.

 Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to rejoice because of his life.

 And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to destroy him, and when he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Because this is all that thou hast desired, that I would release thy brethren, and suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant unto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and forever; and I will govern him no more--

 And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of prison, and thou and thy brethren may come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall greatly desire to see thee. For the king was greatly astonished at the words which he had spoken, and also at the words which had been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore he was desirous to learn them.

 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their journey towards the land of Middoni. And Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon were brought forth out of prison.

 And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful, for behold they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly because of being bound with strong cords. And they also had suffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions; nevertheless they were patient in all their sufferings.

 And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; therefore they would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out, and had smitten them, and had driven them from house to house, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in the land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into prison, and bound with strong cords, and kept in prison for many days, and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon.

 An account of the preaching of Aaron, and Muloki, and their brethren, to the Lamanites. Comprising chapters 21 to 26 inclusive.

 Rejected by the Amalekites, Aaron and Muloki go to Middoni--They are imprisoned--Their release and missionary labors--Ammon's further success--Synagogues built.

 Now when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites, Jerusalem, calling it after the land of their fathers' nativity; and it was away joining the borders of Mormon.

 Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of Amulon had built a great city, which was called Jerusalem.

 Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites and the Amulonites were still harder; therefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax strong in wickedness and their abominations.

 And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and first began to preach to the Amalekites. And he began to preach to them in their synagogues, for they had built synagogues after the order of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors.

 Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to preach unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast testified? Hast thou seen an angel? Why do not angels appear unto us? Behold are not this people as good as thy people?

 Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish. How knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts? How knowest thou that we have cause to repent? How knowest thou that we are not a righteous people? Behold, we have built sanctuaries, and we do assemble ourselves together to worship God. We do believe that God will save all men.

 Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God shall come to redeem mankind from their sins?

 And the man said unto him: We do not believe that thou knowest any such thing. We do not believe in these foolish traditions. We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.

 Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and that there could be no redemption for mankind save it were through the death and sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood.

 And it came to pass as he began to expound these things unto them they were angry with him, and began to mock him; and they would not hear the words which he spake.

 Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he departed out of their synagogue, and came over to a village which was called Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word unto them; and also Ammah and his brethren. And they contended with many about the word.

 And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into the land of Middoni. And they did preach the word unto many, and few believed on the words which they taught.

 Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were taken and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni unto the regions round about.

 And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and they were delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon, and they were fed and clothed.

 And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they were delivered for the first time out of prison; and thus they had suffered.

 And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the Spirit of the Lord, preaching the word of God in every synagogue of the Amalekites, or in every assembly of the Lamanites where they could be admitted.

 And it came to pass that the Lord began to bless them, insomuch that they brought many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, they did convince many of their sins, and of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.

 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned from the land of Middoni to the land of Ishmael, which was the land of their inheritance.

 And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should serve him, or be his servant.

 But he caused that there should be synagogues built in the land of Ishmael; and he caused that his people, or the people who were under his reign, should assemble themselves together.

 And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many things. And he did also declare unto them that they were a people who were under him, and that they were a free people, that they were free from the oppressions of the king, his father; for that his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the people who were in the land of Ishmael, and in all the land round about.

 And he also declared unto them that they might have the liberty of worshiping the Lord their God according to their desires, in whatsoever place they were in, if it were in the land which was under the reign of king Lamoni.

 And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; and it came to pass that he did teach them all things concerning things pertaining to righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with all diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were zealous for keeping the commandments of God.

 Aaron in the land of Nephi--The king and all his household converted--Country divided between Nephites and Lamanites.

 Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was led by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the king which was over all the land save it were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.

 And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king's palace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and said unto him: Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast delivered out of prison.

 And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy servants. And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant unto you your lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been somewhat troubled in mind because of the generosity and the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with thee.

 And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has called him another way; he has gone to the land of Ishmael, to teach the people of Lamoni.

 Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said concerning the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, this is the thing which doth trouble me.

 And also, what is this that Ammon said--If ye will repent ye shall be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off at the last day?

 And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God? And the king said: I know that the Amalekites say that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they should build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves together to worship him. And if now thou sayest there is a God, behold I will believe.

 And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and he said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a God.

 And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?

 And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he created all things both in heaven and in earth. Believest thou this?

 And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all things, and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these things, and I will believe thy words.

 And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the king--how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of transgression, man had fallen.

 And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.

 And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.

 And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.

 But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.

 And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:

 O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day. And now when the king had said these words, he was struck as if he were dead.

 And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen all that had happened unto the king. And she came in unto the king; and when she saw him lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron and his brethren standing as though they had been the cause of his fall, she was angry with them, and commanded that her servants, or the servants of the king, should take them and slay them.

 Now the servants had seen the cause of the king's fall, therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is mightier than us all? Therefore we shall fall before them.

 Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also began to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon her. And she commanded her servants that they should go and call the people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren.

 Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, he, also knowing the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest that a multitude should assemble themselves together, and there should be a great contention and a disturbance among them; therefore he put forth his hand and raised the king from the earth, and said unto him: Stand. And he stood upon his feet, receiving his strength.

 Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of the servants. And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and began to fear. And the king stood forth, and began to minister unto them. And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his whole household were converted unto the Lord.

 Now there was a multitude gathered together because of the commandment of the queen, and there began to be great murmurings among them because of Aaron and his brethren.

 But the king stood forth among them and administered unto them. And they were pacified towards Aaron and those who were with him.

 And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people were pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand forth in the midst of the multitude, and that they should preach the word unto them.

 And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation throughout all the land, amongst all his people who were in all his land, who were in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east and on the west, and which was divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and round about on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of the wilderness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla, through the borders of Manti, by the head of the river Sidon, running from the east towards the west--and thus were the Lamanites and the Nephites divided.

 Now, the more idle part of the Lamanites lived in the wilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the wilderness on the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the land of Zarahemla, in the borders by the seashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the place of their fathers' first inheritance, and thus bordering along by the seashore.

 And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the seashore, whither the Nephites had driven them. And thus the Nephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Nephites had taken possession of all the northern parts of the land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the river Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness side; on the north, even until they came to the land which they called Bountiful.

 And it bordered upon the land which they called Desolation, it being so far northward that it came into the land which had been peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken, which was discovered by the people of Zarahemla, it being the place of their first landing.

 And they came from there up into the south wilderness. Thus the land on the northward was called Desolation, and the land on the southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part of which had come from the land northward for food.

 And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half's journey for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land Desolation, from the east to the west sea; and thus the land of Nephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly surrounded by water, there being a small neck of land between the land northward and the land southward.

 And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land Bountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the Nephites in their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed in the Lamanites on the south, that thereby they should have no more possession on the north, that they might not overrun the land northward.

 Therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only in the land of Nephi, and the wilderness round about. Now this was wisdom in the Nephites--as the Lamanites were an enemy to them, they would not suffer their afflictions on every hand, and also that they might have a country whither they might flee, according to their desires.

 And now I, after having said this, return again to the account of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and their brethren.

 Religious freedom is proclaimed--Many Lamanites converted--Amalekites and Amulonites reject the truth--The Anti-Nephi-Lehies.

 Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation among all his people, that they should not lay their hands on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor either of their brethren who should go forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any part of their land.

 Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their synagogues, nor scourge them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries.

 And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to their desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and all his household; therefore he sent his proclamation throughout the land unto his people, that the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land, that his people might be convinced concerning the wicked traditions of their fathers, and that they might be convinced that they were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to commit any manner of wickedness.

 And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and his brethren went forth from city to city, and from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and consecrating priests and teachers throughout the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God among them; and thus they began to have great success.

 And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea, thousands were brought to believe in the traditions of the Nephites; and they were taught the records and prophecies which were handed down even to the present time.

 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in them--yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away.

 For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against any of their brethren.

 Now, these are they who were converted unto the Lord:

 The people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Ishmael;

 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Middoni;

 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the city of Nephi;

 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the city of Lemuel, and in the city of Shimnilom.

 And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which were converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war; and they were all Lamanites.

 And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither were any of the Amulonites; but they did harden their hearts, and also the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land wheresoever they dwelt, yea, and all their villages and all their cities.

 Therefore, we have named all the cities of the Lamanites in which they did repent and come to the knowledge of the truth, and were converted.

 And now it came to pass that the king and those who were converted were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby they might be distinguished from their brethren; therefore the king consulted with Aaron and many of their priests, concerning the name that they should take upon them, that they might be distinguished.

 And it came to pass that they called their names Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were called by this name and were no more called Lamanites.

 And they began to be a very industrious people; yea, and they were friendly with the Nephites; therefore, they did open a correspondence with them, and the curse of God did no more follow them.

 Lamanites come against the people of God--Converted Lamanites refuse to take up arms--More conversions.

 And it came to pass that the Amalekites and the Amulonites and the Lamanites who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of Helam, and who were in the land of Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the land round about, who had not been converted and had not taken upon them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to anger against their brethren.

 And their hatred became exceedingly sore against them, even insomuch that they began to rebel against their king, insomuch that they would not that he should be their king; therefore, they took up arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

 Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called his name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

 And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against the people of God.

 Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up with him saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon met all his brethren; and from thence they came to the land of Ishmael that they might hold a council with Lamoni and also with his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend themselves against the Lamanites.

 Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king commanded them that they should not.

 Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God has in goodness sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers.

 And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites.

 And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this correspondence we have been convinced of our sins, and of the many murders which we have committed.

 And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of these things, and also that he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which we have committed, and taken away the guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son.

 And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain--

 Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren.

 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins.

 And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.

 Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean thereby.

 And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be saved.

 And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth.

 And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man's blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.

 And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.

 And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land.

 Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword.

 And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand and five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell with their God.

 Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but that they would lie down and perish, and praised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword--

 Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which they had done.

 And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had committed; and they came down even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them.

 And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were saved.

 And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people.

 Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were Amalekites and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors.

 Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were none who were Amalekites or Amulonites, or who were of the order of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel.

 And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away into sin and transgression, they become more hardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though they had never known these things.

 Lamanite aggressions--Vengeance by Amulonites--Martyrdoms--Further fulfilment of Abinadi's prophecy.

 And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more angry because they had slain their brethren; therefore they swore vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time.

 But they took their armies and went over into the borders of the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people who were in the land of Ammonihah and destroyed them.

 And after that, they had many battles with the Nephites, in the which they were driven and slain.

 And among the Lamanites who were slain were almost all the seed of Amulon and his brethren, who were the priests of Noah, and they were slain by the hands of the Nephites;

 And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and having usurped the power and authority over the Lamanites, caused that many of the Lamanites should perish by fire because of their belief--

 For many of them, after having suffered much loss and so many afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the words which Aaron and his brethren had preached to them in their land; therefore they began to disbelieve the traditions of their fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great power unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in the wilderness.

 And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of the children of Amulon caused that they should be put to death, yea, all those that believed in these things.

 Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should be stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the wilderness; and the Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon and his brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into the east wilderness.

 And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites. Thus the words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said concerning the seed of the priests who caused that he should suffer death by fire.

 For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me shall be a type of things to come.

 And now Abinadi was the first that suffered death by fire because of his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that many should suffer death by fire, according as he had suffered.

 And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should cause many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and that they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep having no shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts; and now behold, these words were verified, for they were driven by the Lamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten.

 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

 And they did also bury their weapons of war, according as their brethren had, and they began to be a righteous people; and they did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep his commandments and his statutes.

 Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient that they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look forward to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of Moses was a type of his coming, and believing that they must keep those outward performances until the time that he should be revealed unto them.

 Now they did not suppose that salvation came by the law of Moses; but the law of Moses did serve to strengthen their faith in Christ; and thus they did retain a hope through faith, unto eternal salvation, relying upon the spirit of prophecy, which spake of those things to come.

 And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and their brethren did rejoice exceedingly, for the success which they had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had granted unto them according to their prayers, and that he had also verified his word unto them in every particular.

 Ammon glories in the Lord--Boasting in righteousness--He recounts blessings to him and his brethren.

 And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which say thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we started from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted unto us such great blessings?

 And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can ye tell?

 Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.

 Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and have been brought into the fold of God.

 Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted.

 Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.

 But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day.

 Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.

 For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, who have so dearly beloved us, would still have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they would also have been strangers to God.

 And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting.

 But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.

 Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.

 Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love, and this because of the power of his word which is in us, therefore have we not great reason to rejoice?

 Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most High God, and has loosed our brethren from the chains of hell.

 Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and destruction; but behold, he has brought them into his everlasting light, yea, into everlasting salvation; and they are encircled about with the matchless bounty of his love; yea, and we have been instruments in his hands of doing this great and marvelous work.

 Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea, we will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God forever. Behold, who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much of his great power, and of his mercy, and of his long-suffering towards the children of men? Behold, I say unto you, I cannot say the smallest part which I feel.

 Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state?

 Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings to destroy his church.

 Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction, yea, why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us, and doom us to eternal despair?

 Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought. Behold, he did not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over that everlasting gulf of death and misery, even to the salvation of our souls.

 And now behold, my brethren, what natural man is there that knoweth these things? I say unto you, there is none that knoweth these things, save it be the penitent.

 Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing--unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.

 Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn?

 For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that this was their language.

 And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that we destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and destroy us.

 But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness not with the intent to destroy our brethren, but with the intent that perhaps we might save some few of their souls.

 Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success.

 And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the world--not upon the mercies of the world alone but upon the mercies of God.

 And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we have taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and their synagogues and taught them; and we have been cast out, and mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have been stoned, and taken and bound with strong cords, and cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been delivered again.

 And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this, that perhaps we might be the means of saving some soul; and we supposed that our joy would be full if perhaps we could be the means of saving some.

 Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our labors; and are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are many; yea, and we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren and also towards us.

 For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and they have buried their weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards their brethren.

 And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in all the land? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites.

 For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold how many of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because of their love and of their hatred to sin.

 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.

 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land.

 Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.

 People of Anti-Nephi-Lehi seek safety in Zarahemla--They are called the people of Ammon--Land of Jershon given to them.

 Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites who had gone to war against the Nephites had found, after their many struggles to destroy them, that it was in vain to seek their destruction, they returned again to the land of Nephi.

 And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their loss, were exceedingly angry. And when they saw that they could not seek revenge from the Nephites, they began to stir up the people in anger against their brethren, the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them.

 Now this people again refused to take their arms, and they suffered themselves to be slain according to the desires of their enemies.

 Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction among those whom they so dearly beloved, and among those who had so dearly beloved them--for they were treated as though they were angels sent from God to save them from everlasting destruction--therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw this great work of destruction, they were moved with compassion, and they said unto the king:

 Let us gather together this people of the Lord, and let us go down to the land of Zarahemla to our brethren the Nephites, and flee out of the hands of our enemies, that we be not destroyed.

 But the king said unto them: Behold, the Nephites will destroy us, because of the many murders and sins we have committed against them.

 And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he say unto us, go down unto our brethren, will ye go?

 And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go, we will go down unto our brethren, and we will be their slaves until we repair unto them the many murders and sins which we have committed against them.

 But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law of our brethren, which was established by my father, that there should be any slaves among them; therefore let us go down and rely upon the mercies of our brethren.

 But the king said unto him: Inquire of the Lord, and if he saith unto us go, we will go; otherwise we will perish in the land.

 And it came to pass that Ammon went and inquired of the Lord, and the Lord said unto him:

 Get this people out of this land, that they perish not; for Satan has great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir up the Lamanites to anger against their brethren to slay them; therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this people in this generation, for I will preserve them.

 And now it came to pass that Ammon went and told the king all the words which the Lord had said unto him.

 And they gathered together all their people, yea, all the people of the Lord, and did gather together all their flocks and herds, and departed out of the land, and came into the wilderness which divided the land of Nephi from the land of Zarahemla, and came over near the borders of the land.

 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and my brethren will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye shall remain here until we return; and we will try the hearts of our brethren, whether they will that ye shall come into their land.

 And it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the land, that he and his brethren met Alma, over in the place of which has been spoken; and behold, this was a joyful meeting.

 Now the joy of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea, he was swallowed up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting of his strength; and he fell again to the earth.

 Now was not this exceeding joy? Behold, this is joy which none receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of happiness.

 Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was truly great, and also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold their joy was not that to exceed their strength.

 And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back to the land of Zarahemla; even to his own house. And they went and told the chief judge all the things that had happened unto them in the land of Nephi, among their brethren, the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that the chief judge sent a proclamation throughout all the land, desiring the voice of the people concerning the admitting their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: Behold, we will give up the land of Jershon, which is on the east by the sea, which joins the land Bountiful, which is on the south of the land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the land which we will give unto our brethren for an inheritance.

 And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon and the land Nephi, that we may protect our brethren in the land Jershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against their brethren lest they should commit sin; and this their great fear came because of their sore repentance which they had, on account of their many murders and their awful wickedness.

 And now behold, this will we do unto our brethren, that they may inherit the land Jershon; and we will guard them from their enemies with our armies, on condition that they will give us a portion of their substance to assist us that we may maintain our armies.

 Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he returned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and made known unto them all these things. And Alma also related unto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and his brethren.

 And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them. And they went down into the land of Jershon, and took possession of the land of Jershon; and they were called by the Nephites the people of Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by that name ever after.

 And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God. And they were also distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.

 And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren with the greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed upon to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did look upon death with any degree of terror, for their hope and views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore, death was swallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it.

 Therefore, they would suffer death in the most aggravating and distressing manner which could be inflicted by their brethren, before they would take the sword or cimeter to smite them.

 And thus they were a zealous and beloved people, a highly favored people of the Lord.

 Lamanites make war upon Nephites--A tremendous battle--Lamanites defeated--Deep mourning.

 And now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were established in the land of Jershon, and a church also established in the land of Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set round about the land of Jershon, yea, in all the borders round about the land of Zarahemla; behold the armies of the Lamanites had followed their brethren into the wilderness.

 And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as never had been known among all the people in the land from the time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the Lamanites were slain and scattered abroad.

 Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter among the people of Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites were driven and scattered, and the people of Nephi returned again to their land.

 And now this was a time that there was a great mourning and lamentation heard throughout all the land, among all the people of Nephi--

 Yea, the cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also of fathers mourning for their sons, and the daughter for the brother, yea, the brother for the father; and thus the cry of mourning was heard among all of them, mourning for their kindred who had been slain.

 And now surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of solemnity, and a time of much fasting and prayer.

 And thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi;

 And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their journeyings in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land, their sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehensible joy, and the reception and safety of the brethren in the land of Jershon. And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless their souls forever.

 And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites; and the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is ended.

 And from the first year to the fifteenth has brought to pass the destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has brought to pass an awful scene of bloodshed.

 And the bodies of many thousands are laid low in the earth, while the bodies of many thousands are moldering in heaps upon the face of the earth; yea, and many thousands are mourning for the loss of their kindred, because they have reason to fear, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are consigned to a state of endless wo.

 While many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of their kindred, yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and even know, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are raised to dwell at the right hand of God, in a state of never-ending happiness.

 And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of sin and transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by the cunning plans which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men.

 And thus we see the great call of diligence of men to labor in the vineyards of the Lord; and thus we see the great reason of sorrow, and also of rejoicing--sorrow because of death and destruction among men, and joy because of the light of Christ unto life.

 Alma's yearning desire to cry repentance to all--God's word apportioned in wisdom--Alma rejoices over success of his brethren.

 O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!

 Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.

 But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.

 I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.

 Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience.

 Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called?

 Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of the earth?

 For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.

 I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.

 And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me.

 Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and by this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage.

 Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers; and that same God who delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians did deliver them out of bondage.

 Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea, and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word unto this people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full.

 But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to the land of Nephi.

 Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth much fruit; and how great shall be their reward!

 Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were, so great is my joy.

 And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit of their labors that they may go no more out, but that they may praise him forever. And may God grant that it may be done according to my words, even as I have spoken. Amen.

 Korihor the Anti-Christ--Expelled from Jershon and arrested at Gideon--Arraigned in Zarahemla--He demands a sign and is stricken dumb--His miserable death.

 Behold, now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were established in the land of Jershon, yea, and also after the Lamanites were driven out of the land, and their dead were buried by the people of the land--

 Now their dead were not numbered because of the greatness of their numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites numbered--but it came to pass after they had buried their dead, and also after the days of fasting, and mourning, and prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) there began to be continual peace throughout all the land.

 Yea, and the people did observe to keep the commandments of the Lord; and they were strict in observing the ordinances of God, according to the law of Moses; for they were taught to keep the law of Moses until it should be fulfilled.

 And thus the people did have no disturbance in all the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace.

 But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year, there came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was Anti-Christ, for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies which had been spoken by the prophets, concerning the coming of Christ.

 Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.

 For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will serve.

 Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.

 But if he murdered he was punished unto death; and if he robbed he was also punished; and if he stole he was also punished; and if he committed adultery he was also punished; yea, for all this wickedness they were punished.

 For there was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.

 And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could have no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that there should be no Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying:

 O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things? Why do ye look for a Christ? For no man can know of anything which is to come.

 Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish traditions of your fathers.

 How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ.

 Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins. But behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.

 And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.

 And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms--telling them that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof.

 Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach these things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites.

 But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and carried him before Ammon, who was a high priest over that people.

 And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried out of the land. And he came over into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much success, for he was taken and bound and carried before the high priest, and also the chief judge over the land.

 And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye go about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach this people that there shall be no Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings? Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the holy prophets?

 Now the high priest's name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.

 Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage. Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.

 Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.

 And ye also say that Christ shall come. But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a Christ. And ye say also that he shall be slain for the sins of the world--

 And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges.

 Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God--a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be.

 Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land.

 And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.

 And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.

 Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have labored even from the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto my people.

 And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law for our time.

 And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?

 Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in their hearts?

 And Korihor answered him, Yea.

 And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?

 And he answered, Nay.

 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God, and also deny the Christ? For behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come.

 And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only.

 But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto you that they are true; and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these things are true?

 Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God.

 And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words.

 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.

 And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is no God? And yet will ye deny against all these witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show me a sign.

 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed.

 But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.

 Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe.

 Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.

 Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma.

 And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God? In whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign? Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee a sign? Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?

 And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that there was a God.

 But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon me.

 Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God, that the curse might be taken from him.

 But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will.

 And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food.

 Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same judgments would come unto them.

 And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house, begging food for his support.

 And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram--and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead.

 And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell.

 Alma heads a mission to reclaim the apostate Zoramites--The Rameumptom or holy stand--The Zoramite form of worship.

 Now it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to bow down to dumb idols, his heart again began to sicken because of the iniquity of the people.

 For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to know of iniquity among his people; therefore his heart was exceedingly sorrowful because of the separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites.

 Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called Antionum, which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of Jershon, which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites.

 Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great loss on the part of the Nephites.

 And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.

 Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he took with him, and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took two of his sons.

 Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were Shiblon and Corianton; and these are the names of those who went with him among the Zoramites, to preach unto them the word.

 Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites; therefore they had had the word of God preached unto them.

 But they had fallen into great errors, for they would not observe to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses.

 Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation.

 Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land to preach the word unto them.

 Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the week, which day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did worship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had never beheld;

 For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a place for standing, which was high above the head, and the top thereof would only admit one person.

 Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and stand upon the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:

 Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe that thou art holy, and that thou wast a spirit, and that thou art a spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit forever.

 Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no Christ.

 But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou hast elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we thank thee; and we also thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish traditions of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, which doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee, our God.

 And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy people. Amen.

 Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren and his sons had heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all measure.

 For behold, every man did go forth and offer up these same prayers.

 Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which, being interpreted, is the holy stand.

 Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were chosen of him, and that he did not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren, and that their hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about.

 Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this manner, they returned to their homes, never speaking of their God again until they had assembled themselves together again to the holy stand, to offer up thanks after their manner.

 Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that they were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods.

 Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were lifted up unto great boasting, in their pride.

 And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and cried, saying: O, how long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants shall dwell here below in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the children of men?

 Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride. Behold, O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of the world.

 Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say--We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish.

 Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that there shall be no Christ.

 O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and infidelity shall be among this people? O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities. For I am infirm, and such wickedness among this people doth pain my soul.

 O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may have strength, that I may suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people.

 O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success, and also my fellow laborers who are with me--yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and also Amulek and Zeezrom and also my two sons--yea, even all these wilt thou comfort, O Lord. Yea, wilt thou comfort their souls in Christ.

 Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have strength, that they may bear their afflictions which shall come upon them because of the iniquities of this people.

 O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ.

 Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee.

 Now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words, that he clapped his hands upon all them who were with him. And behold, as he clapped his hands upon them, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.

 And after that they did separate themselves one from another, taking no thought for themselves what they should eat, or what they should drink, or what they should put on.

 And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength, that they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith.

 The poor hearken to message of salvation--Alma's commendation and discourse--Faith developed by desire to believe.

 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the people, entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their streets.

 And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to have success among the poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel--

 Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.

 Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the world.

 And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do?

 And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them and that they were in a preparation to hear the word.

 Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched forth his hand, and cried unto those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent, and said unto them:

 I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.

 Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do? --for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we cannot worship our God.

 Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?

 And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week?

 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.

 And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.

 And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?

 Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed--yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.

 Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.

 Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.

 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.

 And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression?

 Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work.

 And now as I said concerning faith--faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.

 And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.

 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times which confound the wise and the learned.

 And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out--now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true--

 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.

 Now, as I said concerning faith--that it was not a perfect knowledge--even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.

 But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.

 Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.

 Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.

 But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.

 And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.

 Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.

 And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.

 And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.

 O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?

 Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.

 And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.

 But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.

 Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.

 And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.

 But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.

 And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.

 Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.

 Alma's discourse continued--True worship not confined to sanctuaries--The prophets Zenos and Zenock again cited.

 Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that they might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or how they should plant the seed, or the word of which he had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith.

 And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.

 Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has said concerning prayer or worship?

 For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me.

 Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.

 And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my prayer.

 And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee, thou didst hear me.

 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto thee, to be heard of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear them.

 Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations.

 Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out and have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger with speedy destruction.

 And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.

 And now Alma said unto them: Do ye believe those scriptures which have been written by them of old?

 Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos said; for, behold he said: Thou hast turned away thy judgments because of thy Son.

 Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the scriptures? If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?

 For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of these things, but Zenock also spake of these things--

 For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord, with this people, because they will not understand thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them because of thy Son.

 And now, my brethren, ye see that a second prophet of old has testified of the Son of God, and because the people would not understand his words they stoned him to death.

 But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who have spoken concerning the Son of God.

 Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live. And many did look and live.

 But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them.

 O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?

 If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.

 And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall plant this word in your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your faith. And behold, it will become a tree, springing up in you unto everlasting life. And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye will. Amen.

 Amulek's testimony--The great and last sacrifice--How mercy satisfies justice--Repentance not to be procrastinated.

 And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying:

 My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that these things were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us.

 And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you what ye should do, because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience--

 Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness.

 And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ.

 And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.

 My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are true.

 And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.

 For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.

 For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.

 Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay.

 But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.

 Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.

 And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.

 And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.

 And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.

 Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;

 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.

 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.

 Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.

 Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.

 Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.

 Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.

 Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.

 Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.

 But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.

 Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.

 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.

 Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.

 And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance.

 Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.

 For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.

 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.

 Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.

 For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.

 And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb.

 And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ;

 That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.

 Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptations of the devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing.

 And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile against those who do cast you out because of your exceeding poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them;

 But that ye have patience, and bear with those afflictions, with a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions.

 Nephite missionaries retire to land of Jershon--Their Zoramite converts, expelled from their own country, rejoin them--Preparations for war.

 Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of these words, they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over into the land of Jershon.

 Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the word unto the Zoramites, also came over into the land of Jershon.

 And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the Zoramites had consulted together concerning the words which had been preached unto them, they were angry because of the word, for it did destroy their craft; therefore they would not hearken unto the words.

 And they sent and gathered together throughout all the land all the people, and consulted with them concerning the words which had been spoken.

 Now their rulers and their priests and their teachers did not let the people know concerning their desires; therefore they found out privily the minds of all the people.

 And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all the people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were many; and they came over also into the land of Jershon.

 And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did minister unto them.

 Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of Ammon who were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the Zoramites, being a very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon desiring them that they should cast out of their land all those who came over from them into their land.

 And he breathed out many threatenings against them. And now the people of Ammon did not fear their words; therefore they did not cast them out, but they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites that came over unto them; and they did nourish them, and did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for their inheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their wants.

 Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger against the people of Ammon, and they began to mix with the Lamanites and to stir them up also to anger against them.

 And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against the people of Ammon, and also against the Nephites.

 And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon, and came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon for the armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and the Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges; and an account shall be given of their wars hereafter.

 And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the two sons of Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, after having been instruments in the hands of God of bringing many of the Zoramites to repentance; and as many as were brought to repentance were driven out of their land; but they have lands for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have taken up arms to defend themselves, and their wives, and children, and their lands.

 Now Alma, being grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea for the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which were among them; and having been to declare the word, or sent to declare the word, among all the people in every city; and seeing that the hearts of the people began to wax hard, and that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.

 Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together, that he might give unto them every one his charge, separately, concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness. And we have an account of his commandments, which he gave unto them according to his own record.

 The commandments of Alma to his son Helaman. Comprising chapters 36 and 37.

 Alma recounts his sinful past, his miraculous conversion, and his subsequent zeal in the ministry.

 My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land.

 I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions.

 And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.

 And I would not that ye think that I know of myself--not of the temporal but of the spiritual, not of the carnal mind but of God.

 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things; but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, made these things known unto me, not of any worthiness of myself;

 For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.

 And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.

 But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel.

 And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of God.

 And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs.

 And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words--If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God--I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.

 But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.

 Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.

 Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.

 Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.

 And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.

 And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.

 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.

 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.

 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!

 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.

 Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.

 But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God.

 Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

 Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors;

 For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.

 And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me.

 And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time.

 Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem; and he has also, by his everlasting power, delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from time to time even down to the present day; and I have always retained in remembrance their captivity; yea, and ye also ought to retain in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity.

 But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence. Now this is according to his word.

 Helaman entrusted with the records and other sacred relics--Gazelem--The Liahona a type of the word of Christ.

 And now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the records which have been entrusted with me;

 And I also command you that ye keep a record of this people, according as I have done, upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all these things sacred which I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it is for a wise purpose that they are kept.

 And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning--

 Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.

 And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their brightness; yea, and they will retain their brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates which do contain that which is holy writ.

 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.

 And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.

 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls.

 Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.

 And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer?

 Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear.

 And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.

 O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God. And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land--but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.

 And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations.

 And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.

 But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them) behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.

 For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto you, for he has fulfilled his promises which he has made unto our fathers.

 For he promised unto them that he would preserve these things for a wise purpose in him, that he might show forth his power unto future generations.

 And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the restoration of many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also still show forth his power in them unto future generations; therefore they shall be preserved.

 Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in fulfilling all my words, and that ye be diligent in keeping the commandments of God as they are written.

 And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four plates, that ye keep them, that the mysteries and the works of darkness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those people who have been destroyed, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their plunderings, and all their wickedness and abominations, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these interpreters.

 For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders and abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed from off the face of the earth.

 And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations.

 And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the word of God might be fulfilled, which he spake, saying:

 I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret works and their abominations; and except they repent I will destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their secrets and abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land.

 And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they have been destroyed, and thus far the word of God has been fulfilled; yea, their secret abominations have been brought out of darkness and made known unto us.

 And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all their signs and their wonders ye shall keep from this people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be destroyed.

 For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction shall come upon all those workers of darkness, according to the power of God, when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people might not be destroyed.

 Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and their covenants from this people, and only their wickedness and their murders and their abominations shall ye make known unto them; and ye shall teach them to abhor such wickedness and abominations and murders; and ye shall also teach them that these people were destroyed on account of their wickedness and abominations and their murders.

 For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came among them to declare unto them concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their God for vengeance upon those who were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of darkness and secret combinations.

 Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those workers of darkness and secret combinations, even unto destruction, except they repent before they are fully ripe.

 And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto you; trust not those secret plans unto this people, but teach them an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity.

 Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.

 Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.

 O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.

 Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.

 Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.

 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, or director--or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.

 And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious a workmanship. And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.

 And it did work for them according to their faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was done; therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day.

 Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means it did show unto them marvelous works. They were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey;

 Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions.

 And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass (now these things were temporal) they did not prosper; even so it is with things which are spiritual.

 For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.

 And now I say, is there not a type in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.

 O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.

 And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things, yea, see that ye look to God and live. Go unto this people and declare the word, and be sober. My son, farewell.

 The commandments of Alma to his son Shiblon.

 Commended for faithfulness, and counseled to observe meekness and self-control.

 My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.

 And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.

 I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites.

 For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word's sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.

 And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.

 Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things.

 But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare unto me that I must stop the work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth.

 And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.

 And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness.

 And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things.

 See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.

 Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness.

 Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.

 Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy--yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.

 And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down in peace. Now go, my son, and teach the word unto this people. Be sober. My son, farewell.

 The commandments of Alma to his son Corianton. Comprising chapters 39 to 42 inclusive.

 Corianton reproved for harlotry--His sinful conduct had affected faith of the Zoramites--Christ's redemption retroactive.

 And now, my son, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I said unto thy brother; for behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments of God? Behold, has he not set a good example for thee?

 For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the Zoramites. Now this is what I have against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom.

 And this is not all, my son. Thou didst do that which was grievous unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron among the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot Isabel.

 Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.

 Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?

 For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is unpardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.

 And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so great a crime. I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for your good.

 But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day.

 Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.

 And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel.

 Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots. Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words.

 And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy children to do good, lest they lead away the hearts of many people to destruction; therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of God, that ye refrain from your iniquities;

 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done.

 Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you.

 And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the coming of Christ. Behold, I say unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people.

 And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings unto this people, to prepare their minds; or rather that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the minds of their children to hear the word at the time of his coming.

 And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. Behold, you marvel why these things should be known so long beforehand. Behold, I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as a soul will be at the time of his coming?

 Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be made known unto this people as well as unto their children?

 Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel to declare these glad tidings unto us as unto our children, or as after the time of his coming?

 Alma to Corianton continued--Resurrection universal--Separate states of righteous and wicked between death and resurrection--A literal restoration.

 Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say unto thee; for I perceive that thy mind is worried concerning the resurrection of the dead.

 Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection--or, I would say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on immortality, this corruption does not put on incorruption--until after the coming of Christ.

 Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead. But behold, my son, the resurrection is not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are kept, that no one knoweth them save God himself. But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I might know--that is concerning the resurrection.

 Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth from the dead. Now when this time cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time which is appointed.

 Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case--that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.

 Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the time of the resurrection.

 And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from this time of death to the time appointed for the resurrection?

 Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise it mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this mattereth not; all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.

 Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the resurrection. And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I do know.

 And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know that God knoweth all the times which are appointed unto man.

 Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection--Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.

 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.

 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil--for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house--and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.

 Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.

 Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken.

 And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first resurrection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead.

 Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their consignation to happiness or misery. Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth.

 Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the soul with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of Christ.

 Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ.

 Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into heaven.

 But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.

 Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.

 The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.

 And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets--

 And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.

 But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter cup.

 Alma to Corianton continued--What restoration signifies--Men to be judged according to their deeds and desires--Self-judgment.

 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this thing. And I perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto thee.

 I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order. Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part of the body should be restored to itself.

 And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.

 And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil. Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame--mortality raised to immortality, corruption to incorruption--raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other--

 The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.

 And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.

 These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.

 Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.

 And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin.

 Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.

 And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.

 And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?

 O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish--good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.

 Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.

 For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.

 Alma to Corianton continued--Justice and mercy expounded--The tree of life--Mortality a period of probation--Spiritual and temporal death--Repentance, atonement, law, punishment, all necessary.

 And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand--which is concerning the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.

 Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee. For behold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken--yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life--

 Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit--

 And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.

 For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.

 But behold, it was appointed unto man to die--therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth--and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.

 And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will.

 Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.

 Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.

 Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.

 And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord.

 And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;

 Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.

 And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence.

 And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.

 Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the life of the soul.

 Now, how could a man repent except he should sin? How could he sin if there was no law? How could there be a law save there was a punishment?

 Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of conscience unto man.

 Now, if there was no law given--if a man murdered he should die--would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?

 And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin.

 And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could justice do, or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon the creature?

 But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.

 But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.

 For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.

 What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.

 And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.

 Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds.

 If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God.

 And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.

 O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more. Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility.

 And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people. And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them. And may God grant unto you even according to my words. Amen.

 Another Lamanite invasion--Armies of Moroni and Lehi surround and overpower the enemy.

 And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth among the people, to declare the word unto them. And Alma, also, himself, could not rest, and he also went forth.

 Now we shall say no more concerning their preaching, except that they preached the word, and the truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and revelation; and they preached after the holy order of God by which they were called.

 And now I return to an account of the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges.

 For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their thousands; and they came into the land of Antionum, which is the land of the Zoramites; and a man by the name of Zerahemnah was their leader.

 And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites were, in and of themselves, therefore, Zerahemnah appointed chief captains over the Lamanites, and they were all Amalekites and Zoramites.

 Now this he did that he might preserve their hatred towards the Nephites, that he might bring them into subjection to the accomplishment of his designs.

 For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he did that he might usurp great power over them, and also that he might gain power over the Nephites by bringing them into bondage.

 And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and their houses, and their wives, and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might preserve their rights and their privileges, yea, and also their liberty, that they might worship God according to their desires.

 For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites, that whosoever should worship God in spirit and in truth, the true and the living God, the Lamanites would destroy.

 Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the people of Ammon--and they would not take up arms, yea, they had entered into a covenant and they would not break it--therefore, if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites they would be destroyed.

 And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be destroyed; therefore they gave them lands for their inheritance.

 And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large portion of their substance to support their armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled, alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, who were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all those who had dissented from the Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the descendants of the priests of Noah.

 Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the Nephites; and thus the Nephites were obliged to contend with their brethren, even unto bloodshed.

 And it came to pass as the armies of the Lamanites had gathered together in the land of Antionum, behold, the armies of the Nephites were prepared to meet them in the land of Jershon.

 Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who had been appointed to be the chief captain over the Nephites--now the chief captain took the command of all the armies of the Nephites--and his name was Moroni;

 And Moroni took all the command, and the government of their wars. And he was only twenty and five years old when he was appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites.

 And it came to pass that he met the Lamanites in the borders of Jershon, and his people were armed with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war.

 And when the armies of the Lamanites saw that the people of Nephi, or that Moroni, had prepared his people with breastplates and with arm-shields, yea, and also shields to defend their heads, and also they were dressed with thick clothing--

 Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing; they had only their swords and their cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their stones and their slings; and they were naked, save it were a skin which was girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and the Amalekites;

 But they were not armed with breastplates, nor shields--therefore, they were exceedingly afraid of the armies of the Nephites because of their armor, notwithstanding their number being so much greater than the Nephites.

 Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come against the Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey round about in the wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of Manti and take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither they had gone.

 But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go to defend themselves against the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma, and Alma informed the messengers of Moroni, that the armies of the Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness, that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might commence an attack upon the weaker part of the people. And those messengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni.

 Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest by any means a part of the Lamanites should come into that land and take possession of the city, took the remaining part of his army and marched over into the land of Manti.

 And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land should gather themselves together to battle against the Lamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights and their liberties; therefore they were prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should be secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on the west of the river Sidon in the wilderness.

 And Moroni placed spies round about, that he might know when the camp of the Lamanites should come.

 And now, as Moroni knew the intention of the Lamanites, that it was their intention to destroy their brethren, or to subject them and bring them into bondage that they might establish a kingdom unto themselves over all the land;

 And he also knowing that it was the only desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands, and their liberty, and their church, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem; therefore, he found by his spies which course the Lamanites were to take.

 Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into the valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill Riplah;

 And the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the west of the river Sidon, and so down into the borders of the land Manti.

 And thus having placed his army according to his desire, he was prepared to meet them.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up on the north of the hill, where a part of the army of Moroni was concealed.

 And as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into the valley, and began to cross the river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the south of the hill, which was led by a man whose name was Lehi, and he led his army forth and encircled the Lamanites about on the east in their rear.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites coming upon them in their rear, turned them about and began to contend with the army of Lehi.

 And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was more dreadful on the part of the Lamanites, for their nakedness was exposed to the heavy blows of the Nephites with their swords and their cimeters, which brought death almost at every stroke.

 While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords and the loss of blood, they being shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the body being shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their breastplates, and their armshields, and their head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of death among the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, because of the great destruction among them, even until they began to flee towards the river Sidon.

 And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon, and they crossed the waters of Sidon. And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon that they should not cross.

 And it came to pass that Moroni and his army met the Lamanites in the valley, on the other side of the river Sidon, and began to fall upon them and to slay them.

 And the Lamanites did flee again before them, towards the land of Manti; and they were met again by the armies of Moroni.

 Now in this case the Lamanites did fight exceedingly; yea, never had the Lamanites been known to fight with such exceedingly great strength and courage, no, not even from the beginning.

 And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites, who were their chief captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their chief captain, or their chief leader and commander; yea, they did fight like dragons, and many of the Nephites were slain by their hands, yea, for they did smite in two many of their head-plates, and they did pierce many of their breastplates, and they did smite off many of their arms; and thus the Lamanites did smite in their fierce anger.

 Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.

 And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they owed to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers, that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies.

 And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed. Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion.

 And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them. And Moroni, perceiving their intent, sent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughts--yea, the thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their freedom from bondage.

 And it came to pass that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they cried with one voice unto the Lord their God, for their liberty and their freedom from bondage.

 And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in that selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their freedom, the Lamanites began to flee before them; and they fled even to the waters of Sidon.

 Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than double the number of the Nephites; nevertheless, they were driven insomuch that they were gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the bank by the river Sidon.

 Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea, even on both sides of the river, for behold, on the east were the men of Lehi.

 Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they were encircled about by the Nephites, they were struck with terror.

 Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded his men that they should stop shedding their blood.

 Moroni's magnanimity--Zerahemnah rejects his peace offer, but is compelled to accept terms--Lamanites make covenant of peace--End of Alma's record.

 And it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from them. And Moroni said unto Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do not desire to be men of blood. Ye know that ye are in our hands, yet we do not desire to slay you.

 Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of bondage. But this is the very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our religion.

 But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye should understand that this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in Christ. And now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.

 Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.

 And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us--

 Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires which ye have for life, that ye deliver up your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will go your way and come not again to war against us.

 And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in our hands, and I will command my men that they shall fall upon you, and inflict the wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we will see who shall have power over this people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into bondage.

 And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these sayings he came forth and delivered up his sword and his cimeter, and his bow into the hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold, here are our weapons of war; we will deliver them up unto you, but we will not suffer ourselves to take an oath unto you, which we know that we shall break, and also our children; but take our weapons of war, and suffer that we may depart into the wilderness; otherwise we will retain our swords, and we will perish or conquer.

 Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not believe that it is God that has delivered us into your hands; but we believe that it is your cunning that has preserved you from our swords. Behold, it is your breastplates and your shields that have preserved you.

 And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words, Moroni returned the sword and the weapons of war, which he had received, unto Zerahemnah, saying: Behold, we will end the conflict.

 Now I cannot recall the words which I have spoken, therefore as the Lord liveth, ye shall not depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not return again against us to war. Now as ye are in our hands we will spill your blood upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I have proposed.

 And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might slay Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of Moroni's soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and he also smote Zerahemnah that he took off his scalp and it fell to the earth. And Zerahemnah withdrew from before them into the midst of his soldiers.

 And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took up the scalp from off the ground by the hair, and laid it upon the point of his sword, and stretched it forth unto them, saying unto them with a loud voice:

 Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the scalp of your chief, so shall ye fall to the earth except ye will deliver up your weapons of war and depart with a covenant of peace.

 Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a covenant of peace. And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to depart into the wilderness.

 Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth, and he did stir up the remainder of his soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully against the Nephites.

 And now Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded his people that they should fall upon them and slay them. And it came to pass that they began to slay them; yea, and the Lamanites did contend with their swords and their might.

 But behold, their naked skins and their bare heads were exposed to the sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold they were pierced and smitten, yea, and did fall exceedingly fast before the swords of the Nephites; and they began to be swept down, even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied.

 Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni, promising that he would covenant and also his people with them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, that they never would come to war again against them.

 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death should cease again among the people. And he took the weapons of war from the Lamanites; and after they had entered into a covenant with him of peace they were suffered to depart into the wilderness.

 Now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the greatness of the number; yea, the number of their dead was exceedingly great, both on the Nephites and on the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the waters of Sidon, and they have gone forth and are buried in the depths of the sea.

 And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni, returned and came to their houses and their lands.

 And thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. And thus ended the record of Alma, which was written upon the plates of Nephi.

 The account of the people of Nephi, and their wars and dissensions, in the days of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman, which he kept in his days. Comprising chapters 45 to 62 inclusive.

 Nephite extinction again foretold--Alma's departure compared to that of Moses--Dissension in the church.

 Behold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.

 And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son Helaman and said unto him: Believest thou the words which I spake unto thee concerning those records which have been kept?

 And Helaman said unto him: Yea, I believe.

 And Alma said again: Believest thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come?

 And he said: Yea, I believe all the words which thou hast spoken.

 And Alma said unto him again: Will ye keep my commandments?

 And he said: Yea, I will keep thy commandments with all my heart.

 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord shall prosper thee in this land.

 But behold, I have somewhat to prophesy unto thee; but what I prophesy unto thee ye shall not make known; yea, what I prophesy unto thee shall not be made known, even until the prophecy is fulfilled; therefore write the words which I shall say.

 And these are the words: Behold, I perceive that this very people, the Nephites, according to the spirit of revelation which is in me, in four hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ shall manifest himself unto them, shall dwindle in unbelief.

 Yea, and then shall they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines and bloodshed, even until the people of Nephi shall become extinct--

 Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall into the works of darkness, and lasciviousness, and all manner of iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the fourth generation shall not all pass away before this great iniquity shall come.

 And when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh that those who are now, or the seed of those who are now numbered among the people of Nephi, shall no more be numbered among the people of Nephi.

 But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great and dreadful day, shall be numbered among the Lamanites, and shall become like unto them, all, save it be a few who shall be called the disciples of the Lord; and them shall the Lamanites pursue even until they shall become extinct. And now, because of iniquity, this prophecy shall be fulfilled.

 And now it came to pass that after Alma had said these things to Helaman, he blessed him, and also his other sons; and he also blessed the earth for the righteous' sake.

 And he said: Thus saith the Lord God--Cursed shall be the land, yea, this land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto destruction, which do wickedly, when they are fully ripe; and as I have said so shall it be; for this is the cursing and the blessing of God upon the land, for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.

 And now, when Alma had said these words he blessed the church, yea, all those who should stand fast in the faith from that time henceforth.

 And when Alma had done this he departed out of the land of Zarahemla, as if to go into the land of Melek. And it came to pass that he was never heard of more; as to his death or burial we know not of.

 Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses. But behold, the scriptures saith the Lord took Moses unto himself; and we suppose that he has also received Alma in the spirit, unto himself; therefore, for this cause we know nothing concerning his death and burial.

 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Helaman went forth among the people to declare the word unto them.

 For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the many little dissensions and disturbances which had been among the people, it became expedient that the word of God should be declared among them, yea, and that a regulation should be made throughout the church.

 Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish the church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which was possessed by the people of Nephi. And it came to pass that they did appoint priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches.

 And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren had appointed priests and teachers over the churches that there arose a dissension among them, and they would not give heed to the words of Helaman and his brethren;

 But they grew proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because of their exceedingly great riches; therefore they grew rich in their own eyes, and would not give heed to their words, to walk uprightly before God.

 Amalickiah conspires to be king--Moroni and the title of liberty--The people covenant to maintain freedom--flight of Amalickiah.

 And it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the words of Helaman and his brethren were gathered together against their brethren.

 And now behold, they were exceedingly wroth, insomuch that they were determined to slay them.

 Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.

 And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who were wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and they were the greater part of them the lower judges of the land, and they were seeking for power.

 And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people.

 Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, notwithstanding the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church, for they were high priests over the church.

 And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the hand of the Lord.

 Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one.

 Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place among the children of men.

 Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous' sake.

 And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah.

 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it--In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children--and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.

 And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land--

 For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church.

 And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those who were true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should come.

 And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored.

 And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God, he named all the land which was south of the land Desolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and on the south--A chosen land, and the land of liberty.

 And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are despised because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be trodden down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own transgressions.

 And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with a loud voice, saying:

 Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them.

 And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their loins, rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments.

 Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression.

 Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.

 Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed. And he said--Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment.

 Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto God.

 Now behold, this was the language of Jacob.

 And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us? Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.

 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he went forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions, and gathered together all the people who were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called Amalickiahites.

 And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites--and he also saw that his people were doubtful concerning the justice of the cause in which they had undertaken--therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, he took those of his people who would and departed into the land of Nephi.

 Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more strength; therefore he thought to cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes.

 Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his armies, who had gathered themselves together, and armed themselves, and entered into a covenant to keep the peace--and it came to pass that he took his army and marched out with his tents into the wilderness, to cut off the course of Amalickiah in the wilderness.

 And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and marched forth into the wilderness, and headed the armies of Amalickiah.

 And it came to pass that Amalickiah fled with a small number of his men, and the remainder were delivered up into the hands of Moroni and were taken back into the land of Zarahemla.

 Now, Moroni being a man who was appointed by the chief judges and the voice of the people, therefore he had power according to his will with the armies of the Nephites, to establish and to exercise authority over them.

 And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death; and there were but few who denied the covenant of freedom.

 And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty to be hoisted upon every tower which was in all the land, which was possessed by the Nephites; and thus Moroni planted the standard of liberty among the Nephites.

 And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did maintain peace in the land until nearly the end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges.

 And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in the church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have much peace and rejoicing in the church.

 And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly believing that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they went out of the world rejoicing.

 And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons of the year were very frequent in the land--but not so much so with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots which God had prepared to remove the cause of diseases, to which men were subject by the nature of the climate--

 But there were many who died with old age; and those who died in the faith of Christ are happy in him, as we must needs suppose.

 Amalickiah, by treachery, becomes king of the Lamanites--His awful wickedness.

 Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had fled with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken those who went with him, and went up in the land of Nephi among the Lamanites, and did stir up the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land, among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle against the Nephites.

 And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives. And it came to pass that they would not, or the more part of them would not, obey the commandments of the king.

 And now it came to pass that the king was wroth because of their disobedience; therefore he gave Amalickiah the command of that part of his army which was obedient unto his commands, and commanded him that he should go forth and compel them to arms.

 Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very subtle man to do evil therefore he laid the plan in his heart to dethrone the king of the Lamanites.

 And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites who were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of those who were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was called Onidah, for thither had all the Lamanites fled; for they discovered the army coming, and, supposing that they were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah, to the place of arms.

 And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them, being fixed in their minds with a determined resolution that they would not be subjected to go against the Nephites.

 And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon the top of the mount which was called Antipas, in preparation to battle.

 Now it was not Amalickiah's intention to give them battle according to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom.

 And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas.

 And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret embassy into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those who were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should come down to the foot of the mount, for he desired to speak with him.

 And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he durst not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that Amalickiah sent again the second time, desiring him to come down. And it came to pass that Lehonti would not; and he sent again the third time.

 And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could not get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to Lehonti's camp; and he sent again the fourth time his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him.

 And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti's hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army.

 And it came to pass that Lehonti came down with his men and surrounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti.

 And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded, they plead with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to fall in with their brethren, that they might not be destroyed. Now this was the very thing which Amalickiah desired.

 And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to the commands of the king. Now this was the thing that Amalickiah desired, that he might accomplish his designs in dethroning the king.

 Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief leader was killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief leader.

 And it came to pass that Amalickiah caused that one of his servants should administer poison by degrees to Lehonti, that he died.

 Now, when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites appointed Amalickiah to be their leader and their chief commander.

 And it came to pass that Amalickiah marched with his armies (for he had gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, which was the chief city.

 And the king came out to meet him with his guards, for he supposed that Amalickiah had fulfilled his commands, and that Amalickiah had gathered together so great an army to go against the Nephites to battle.

 But behold, as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah caused that his servants should go forth to meet the king. And they went and bowed themselves before the king, as if to reverence him because of his greatness.

 And it came to pass that the king put forth his hand to raise them, as was the custom with the Lamanites, as a token of peace, which custom they had taken from the Nephites.

 And it came to pass that when he had raised the first from the ground, behold he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell to the earth.

 Now the servants of the king fled; and the servants of Amalickiah raised a cry, saying:

 Behold, the servants of the king have stabbed him to the heart, and he has fallen and they have fled; behold, come and see.

 And it came to pass that Amalickiah commanded that his armies should march forth and see what had happened to the king; and when they had come to the spot, and found the king lying in his gore, Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, and said: Whosoever loved the king, let him go forth, and pursue his servants that they may be slain.

 And it came to pass that all they who loved the king, when they heard these words, came forth and pursued after the servants of the king.

 Now when the servants of the king saw an army pursuing after them, they were frightened again, and fled into the wilderness, and came over into the land of Zarahemla and joined the people of Ammon.

 And the army which pursued after them returned, having pursued after them in vain; and thus Amalickiah, by his fraud, gained the hearts of the people.

 And it came to pass on the morrow he entered the city Nephi with his armies, and took possession of the city.

 And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had heard that the king was slain--for Amalickiah had sent an embassy to the queen informing her that the king had been slain by his servants, that he had pursued them with his army, but it was in vain, and they had made their escape--

 Therefore, when the queen had received this message she sent unto Amalickiah, desiring him that he would spare the people of the city; and she also desired him that he should come in unto her; and she also desired him that he should bring witnesses with him to testify concerning the death of the king.

 And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew the king, and all them who were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they all testified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants; and they said also: They have fled; does not this testify against them? And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the death of the king.

 And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the queen, and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud, and by the assistance of his cunning servants, he obtained the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the people of the Lamanites, who were composed of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the present time.

 Now these dissenters, having the same instruction and the same information of the Nephites, yea, having been instructed in the same knowledge of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to relate, not long after their dissensions they became more hardened and impenitent, and more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites--drinking in with the traditions of the Lamanites; giving way to indolence, and all manner of lasciviousness; yea, entirely forgetting the Lord their God.

 Amalickiah incites the Lamanites against Nephites--Moroni prepares for the conflict--A true patriot and a mighty man of God.

 And now it came to pass that, as soon as Amalickiah had obtained the kingdom he began to inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to speak unto the Lamanites from their towers, against the Nephites.

 And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites, insomuch that in the latter end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far, yea, having been made king over the Lamanites, he sought also to reign over all the land, yea, and all the people who were in the land, the Nephites as well as the Lamanites.

 Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened the hearts of the Lamanites and blinded their minds, and stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he had gathered together a numerous host to go to battle against the Nephites.

 For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of his people, to overpower the Nephites and to bring them into bondage.

 And thus he did appoint chief captains of the Zoramites, they being the most acquainted with the strength of the Nephites, and their places of resort, and the weakest parts of their cities; therefore he appointed them to be chief captains over his armies.

 And it came to pass that they took their camp, and moved forth toward the land of Zarahemla in the wilderness.

 Now it came to pass that while Amalickiah had thus been obtaining power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on the other hand, had been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God.

 Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting small forts, or places of resort; throwing up banks of earth round about to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to encircle them about, round about their cities and the borders of their lands; yea, all round about the land.

 And in their weakest fortifications he did place the greater number of men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land which was possessed by the Nephites.

 And thus he was preparing to support their liberty, their lands, their wives, and their children, and their peace, and that they might live unto the Lord their God, and that they might maintain that which was called by their enemies the cause of Christians.

 And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery;

 Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.

 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.

 Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were also taught never to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the sword except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives.

 And this was their faith, that by so doing God would prosper them in the land, or in other words, if they were faithful in keeping the commandments of God that he would prosper them in the land; yea, warn them to flee, or to prepare for war, according to their danger;

 And also, that God would make it known unto them whither they should go to defend themselves against their enemies, and by so doing, the Lord would deliver them; and this was the faith of Moroni, and his heart did glory in it; not in the shedding of blood but in doing good, in preserving his people, yea, in keeping the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.

 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.

 Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.

 Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God, and they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would hearken unto their words.

 And thus they went forth, and the people did humble themselves because of their words, insomuch that they were highly favored of the Lord, and thus they were free from wars and contentions among themselves, yea, even for the space of four years.

 But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth year, yea, notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves, they were compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren, the Lamanites.

 Yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space of many years with the Lamanites, notwithstanding their much reluctance.

 Now, they were sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites, because they did not delight in the shedding of blood; yea, and this was not all--they were sorry to be the means of sending so many of their brethren out of this world into an eternal world, unprepared to meet their God.

 Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their wives and their children should be massacred by the barbarous cruelty of those who were once their brethren, yea, and had dissented from their church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the Lamanites.

 Yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over the blood of the Nephites, so long as there were any who should keep the commandments of God, for the promise of the Lord was, if they should keep his commandments they should prosper in the land.

 The invading Lamanites baffled and repulsed--Amalickiah's wrath over his failure--Prosperity of the church.

 And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the nineteenth year, on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the Lamanites were seen approaching towards the land of Ammonihah.

 And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an army by the borders of the city, and they had cast up dirt round about to shield them from the arrows and the stones of the Lamanites; for behold, they fought with stones and with arrows.

 Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them.

 But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the Nephites had dug up a ridge of earth round about them, which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them that they might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of entrance.

 Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were astonished exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their places of security.

 Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the greatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also prepared themselves with shields, and with breastplates; and they had also prepared themselves with garments of skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness.

 And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily overpower and subject their brethren to the yoke of bondage, or slay and massacre them according to their pleasure.

 But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared for them, in a manner which never had been known among the children of Lehi. Now they were prepared for the Lamanites, to battle after the manner of the instructions of Moroni.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, were exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for war.

 Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi, at the head of his army, perhaps he would have caused the Lamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah; for behold, he did care not for the blood of his people.

 But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle. And behold, his chief captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs among the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were disappointed in their places of retreat and they could not come upon them.

 Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp and marched towards the land of Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for them to come against the Nephites.

 For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built forts of security, for every city in all the land round about; therefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, their chief captains came forward and took an oath that they would destroy the people of that city.

 But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which had hitherto been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, become strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah.

 And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed that they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they would march thither to battle; and thus it was according to his desires.

 And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the Lamanites in the valley on the east of the river Sidon.

 And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless their chief captains had sworn with an oath to attack the city; therefore, they brought up their armies.

 Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of security by any other way save by the entrance, because of the highness of the bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch which had been dug round about, save it were by the entrance.

 And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any other way, by casting over stones and arrows at them.

 Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with their swords and their slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come into their place of security by the place of entrance; and thus were they prepared to defend themselves against the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with an immense slaughter.

 Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth that they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown at them; and instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in a measure with their dead and wounded bodies.

 Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain.

 There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe.

 And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness. And it came to pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth, concerning their great loss.

 And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his people, because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage.

 Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did curse God, and also Moroni, swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood; and this because Moroni had kept the commandments of God in preparing for the safety of his people.

 And it came to pass, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did thank the Lord their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies.

 And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly great prosperity in the church because of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach among the people.

 Moroni fortifies the line between land of Zarahemla and land of Nephi--Morianton plans to occupy the land northward--he is killed by Teancum--Pahoran succeeds Nephihah.

 And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making preparations for war, or to defend his people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges, that they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round about all the cities, throughout all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.

 And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there should be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about the cities.

 And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a frame of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they were strong and high.

 And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them.

 And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and slay him who should attempt to approach near the walls of the city.

 Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their enemies, round about every city in all the land.

 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites who were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla.

 And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea to the west.

 And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants who were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders by the seashore, and possess the land.

 And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their possessions, and caused them to erect fortifications that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their enemies.

 And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the river Sidon--the Nephites possessing all the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure.

 Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possession.

 And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.

 And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah.

 And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one in a particular manner which they called Lehi, which was in the north by the borders of the seashore.

 And thus ended the twentieth year.

 And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi in the commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.

 And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:

 Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

 And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their destructions.

 And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.

 But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges.

 And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign of the judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year.

 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a contention which took place among them concerning the land of Lehi, and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the borders of Lehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore.

 For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did claim a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began to be a warm contention between them, insomuch that the people of Morianton took up arms against their brethren, and they were determined by the sword to slay them.

 But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to the camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for assistance; for behold they were not in the wrong.

 And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who were led by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceedingly fearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy them.

 Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which was northward.

 And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which would have been a cause to have been lamented) but behold, Morianton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her much.

 And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of Moroni, and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and also concerning their intentions to flee into the land northward.

 Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of Morianton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi, yea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty.

 Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people of Morianton, to stop their flight into the land northward.

 And it came to pass that they did not head them until they had come to the borders of the land Desolation; and there they did head them, by the narrow pass which led by the sea into the land northward, yea, by the sea, on the west and on the east.

 And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so stubborn were the people of Morianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering words) that a battle commenced between them, in the which Teancum did slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of Moroni. And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 And thus were the people of Morianton brought back. And upon their covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands.

 And it came to pass that in the same year that the people of Nephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second chief judge, died, having filled the judgment-seat with perfect uprightness before God.

 Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those records and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son, Helaman.

 Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed chief judge and governor over the people, with an oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime.

 Now behold, his name was Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat of his father, and did commence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year, over the people of Nephi.

 King-men and freemen--Pahoran, chief judge, is sustained by the freemen--King-men suppressed--Amalickiah's invasion, defeat, and death.

 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the people of Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth year in peace;

 Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a contention among the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who desired that a few particular points of the law should be altered.

 But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered; therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the law.

 Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed.

 And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land.

 And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them, for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government.

 And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled by the voice of the people. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.

 Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those who sought power and authority over the people.

 But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again stirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the people of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for war with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of Moroni.

 But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come to battle against the Nephites.

 Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been, because of the many thousands who had been slain by the hand of the Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered together a wonderfully great army, insomuch that he feared not to come down to the land of Zarahemla.

 Yea, even Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of the Lamanites. And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges; and it was at the same time that they had begun to settle the affairs of their contentions concerning the chief judge, Pahoran.

 And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not take up arms to defend their country.

 And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceedingly wroth because of the stubbornness of those people whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them.

 And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of the people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and give him (Moroni) power to compel those dissenters to defend their country or to put them to death.

 For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and dissensions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction. And it came to pass that it was granted according to the voice of the people.

 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level them with the earth, or they should take up arms and support the cause of liberty.

 And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them; and they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn down and leveled to the earth.

 And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders who were not slain in battle were taken and cast into prison, for there was no time for their trials at this period.

 And the remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty upon their towers, and in their cities, and to take up arms in defence of their country.

 And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not any known by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the stubbornness and the pride of those people who professed the blood of nobility; but they were brought down to humble themselves like unto their brethren, and to fight valiantly for their freedom from bondage.

 Behold, it came to pass that while Moroni was thus breaking down the wars and contentions among his own people, and subjecting them to peace and civilization, and making regulations to prepare for war against the Lamanites, behold, the Lamanites had come into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.

 And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently strong in the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive them, slaying many. And it came to pass that Amalickiah took possession of the city, yea, possession of all their fortifications.

 And those who fled out of the city of Moroni came to the city of Nephihah; and also the people of the city of Lehi gathered themselves together, and made preparations and were ready to receive the Lamanites to battle.

 But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the Lamanites to go against the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept them down by the seashore, leaving men in every city to maintain and defend it.

 And thus he went on, taking possession of many cities, the city of Nephihah, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Morianton, and the city of Omner, and the city of Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of which were on the east borders by the seashore.

 And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of Amalickiah, so many cities, by their numberless hosts, all of which were strongly fortified after the manner of the fortifications of Moroni; all of which afforded strongholds for the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that they marched to the borders of the land Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them and slaying many.

 But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had slain Morianton and had headed his people in his flight.

 And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was marching forth with his numerous army that he might take possession of the land Bountiful, and also the land northward.

 But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by Teancum and his men, for they were great warriors; for every man of Teancum did exceed the Lamanites in their strength and in their skill of war, insomuch that they did gain advantage over the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that they did slay them even until it was dark. And it came to pass that Teancum and his men did pitch their tents in the borders of the land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the borders on the beach by the seashore, and after this manner were they driven.

 And it came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and his servant stole forth and went out by night, and went into the camp of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had overpowered them because of their much fatigue, which was caused by the labors and heat of the day.

 And it came to pass that Teancum stole privily into the tent of the king, and put a javelin to his heart; and he did cause the death of the king immediately that he did not awake his servants.

 And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his men were asleep, and he awoke them and told them all the things that he had done.

 And he caused that his armies should stand in readiness, lest the Lamanites had awakened and should come upon them.

 And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and thus endeth the days of Amalickiah.

 Ammoron succeeds Amalickiah--Moroni, with Teancum and Lehi, retakes city of Mulek and wins great victory--Death of Jacob, the Lamanite general.

 And now, it came to pass in the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, behold, when the Lamanites awoke on the first morning of the first month, behold, they found Amalickiah was dead in his own tent; and they also saw that Teancum was ready to give them battle on that day.

 And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and they abandoned their design in marching into the land northward, and retreated with all their army into the city of Mulek, and sought protection in their fortifications.

 And it came to pass that the brother of Amalickiah was appointed king over the people; and his name was Ammoron; thus king Ammoron, the brother of king Amalickiah, was appointed to reign in his stead.

 And it came to pass that he did command that his people should maintain those cities, which they had taken by the shedding of blood; for they had not taken any cities save they had lost much blood.

 And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken, and those parts of the land which they had obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of their number, Teancum thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts.

 But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for war; yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself against them, by casting up walls round about and preparing places of resort.

 And it came to pass that he kept thus preparing for war until Moroni had sent a large number of men to strengthen his army.

 And Moroni also sent orders unto him that he should retain all the prisoners who fell into his hands; for as the Lamanites had taken many prisoners, that he should retain all the prisoners of the Lamanites as a ransom for those whom the Lamanites had taken.

 And he also sent orders unto him that he should fortify the land Bountiful, and secure the narrow pass which led into the land northward, lest the Lamanites should obtain that point and should have power to harass them on every side.

 And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be faithful in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he would seek every opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that quarter, as much as was in his power, that perhaps he might take again by stratagem or some other way those cities which had been taken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify and strengthen the cities round about, which had not fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.

 And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold, the Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the west sea; and behold, I go against them, therefore I cannot come unto you.

 Now, the king (Ammoron) had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and had made known unto the queen concerning the death of his brother, and had gathered together a large number of men, and had marched forth against the Nephites on the borders by the west sea.

 And thus he was endeavoring to harass the Nephites, and to draw away a part of their forces to that part of the land, while he had commanded those whom he had left to possess the cities which he had taken, that they should also harass the Nephites on the borders by the east sea, and should take possession of their lands as much as it was in their power, according to the power of their armies.

 And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances in the ending of the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 But behold, it came to pass in the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, that Teancum, by the command of Moroni--who had established armies to protect the south and the west borders of the land, and had begun his march towards the land Bountiful, that he might assist Teancum with his men in retaking the cities which they had lost--

 And it came to pass that Teancum had received orders to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were possible.

 And it came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and march forth with his army against the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible that he could overpower them while they were in their fortifications; therefore he abandoned his designs and returned again to the city Bountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he might receive strength to his army.

 And it came to pass that Moroni did arrive with his army at the land of Bountiful, in the latter end of the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 And in the commencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni and Teancum and many of the chief captains held a council of war--what they should do to cause the Lamanites to come out against them to battle; or that they might by some means flatter them out of their strongholds, that they might gain advantage over them and take again the city of Mulek.

 And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the Lamanites, which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out with his armies to meet them upon the plains between the two cities. But behold, Jacob, who was a Zoramite, would not come out with his army to meet them upon the plains.

 And it came to pass that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them upon fair grounds, therefore, he resolved upon a plan that he might decoy the Lamanites out of their strongholds.

 Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men and march down near the seashore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites had discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, their leader.

 And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the smallness of his numbers. And as Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming out against him he began to retreat down by the seashore, northward.

 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that he began to flee, they took courage and pursued them with vigor. And while Teancum was thus leading away the Lamanites who were pursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni commanded that a part of his army who were with him should march forth into the city, and take possession of it.

 And thus they did, and slew all those who had been left to protect the city, yea, all those who would not yield up their weapons of war.

 And thus Moroni had obtained possession of the city Mulek with a part of his army, while he marched with the remainder to meet the Lamanites when they should return from the pursuit of Teancum.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum until they came near the city Bountiful, and then they were met by Lehi and a small army, which had been left to protect the city Bountiful.

 And now behold, when the chief captains of the Lamanites had beheld Lehi with his army coming against them, they fled in much confusion, lest perhaps they should not obtain the city Mulek before Lehi should overtake them; for they were wearied because of their march, and the men of Lehi were fresh.

 Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their rear with his army; and all they feared was Lehi and his men.

 Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them till they should meet Moroni and his army.

 And it came to pass that before the Lamanites had retreated far they were surrounded by the Nephites, by the men of Moroni on one hand, and the men of Lehi on the other, all of whom were fresh and full of strength; but the Lamanites were wearied because of their long march.

 And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them until they had given up their weapons of war.

 And it came to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being also a Zoramite, and having an unconquerable spirit, he led the Lamanites forth to battle with exceeding fury against Moroni.

 Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was determined to slay them and cut his way through to the city of Mulek. But behold, Moroni and his men were more powerful; therefore they did not give way before the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that they fought on both hands with exceeding fury; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and Moroni was wounded and Jacob was killed.

 And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his strong men, that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their weapons of war; and the remainder of them, being much confused, knew not whither to go or to strike.

 Now Moroni seeing their confusion, he said unto them: If ye will bring forth your weapons of war and deliver them up, behold we will forbear shedding your blood.

 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had heard these words, their chief captains, all those who were not slain, came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and also commanded their men that they should do the same.

 But behold, there were many that would not; and those who would not deliver up their swords were taken and bound, and their weapons of war were taken from them, and they were compelled to march with their brethren forth into the land Bountiful.

 And now the number of prisoners who were taken exceeded more than the number of those who had been slain, yea, more than those who had been slain on both sides.

 City Bountiful fortified--Nephite dissension gives advantage to enemy--Helaman and his two thousand stripling warriors.

 And it came to pass that they did set guards over the prisoners of the Lamanites, and did compel them to go forth and bury their dead, yea, and also the dead of the Nephites who were slain; and Moroni placed men over them to guard them while they should perform their labors.

 And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command of the city and gave it unto Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his battles; and he was a man like unto Moroni, and they rejoiced in each other's safety; yea, they were beloved by each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi.

 And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had finished burying their dead and also the dead of the Nephites, they were marched back into the land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders of Moroni, caused that they should commence laboring in digging a ditch round about the land, or the city, Bountiful.

 And he caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers upon the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against the breastwork of timbers; and thus they did cause the Lamanites to labor until they had encircled the city of Bountiful round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height.

 And this city became an exceeding stronghold ever after; and in this city they did guard the prisoners of the Lamanites; yea, even within a wall which they had caused them to build with their own hands. Now Moroni was compelled to cause the Lamanites to labor, because it was easy to guard them while at their labor; and he desired all his forces when he should make an attack upon the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over one of the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had obtained possession of the city of Mulek, which was one of the strongest holds of the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; and thus he had also built a stronghold to retain his prisoners.

 And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with the Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for war, yea, and in making fortifications to guard against the Lamanites, yea, and also delivering their women and their children from famine and affliction, and providing food for their armies.

 And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on the west sea, south, while in the absence of Moroni on account of some intrigue amongst the Nephites, which caused dissensions amongst them, had gained some ground over the Nephites, yea, insomuch that they had obtained possession of a number of their cities in that part of the land.

 And thus because of iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because of dissensions and intrigue among themselves they were placed in the most dangerous circumstances.

 And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people of Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had been converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the Nephites.

 And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they never would shed blood more; and according to their oath they would have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to have fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for the pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his brethren had had for them.

 And for this cause they were brought down into the land of Zarahemla; and they ever had been protected by the Nephites.

 But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many afflictions and tribulations which the Nephites bore for them, they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the defence of their country.

 But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war, they were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his brethren, for they were about to break the oath which they had made.

 And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls; therefore all those who had entered into this covenant were compelled to behold their brethren wade through their afflictions, in their dangerous circumstances at this time.

 But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites.

 And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty, but they would fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage.

 Now behold, there were two thousand of those young men, who entered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country.

 And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great support; for they took their weapons of war, and they would that Helaman should be their leader.

 And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all--they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.

 Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.

 And now it came to pass that Helaman did march at the head of his two thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people in the borders of the land on the south by the west sea.

 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 Ammoron asks for exchange of prisoners--Moroni grants request upon conditions--The Lamanite king's angry reply.

 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and ninth year of the judges, that Ammoron sent unto Moroni desiring that he would exchange prisoners.

 And it came to pass that Moroni felt to rejoice exceedingly at this request, for he desired the provisions which were imparted for the support of the Lamanite prisoners for the support of his own people; and he also desired his own people for the strengthening of his army.

 Now the Lamanites had taken many women and children, and there was not a woman nor a child among all the prisoners of Moroni, or the prisoners whom Moroni had taken; therefore Moroni resolved upon a stratagem to obtain as many prisoners of the Nephites from the Lamanites as it were possible.

 Therefore he wrote an epistle, and sent it by the servant of Ammoron, the same who had brought an epistle to Moroni. Now these are the words which he wrote unto Ammoron, saying:

 Behold, Ammoron, I have written unto you somewhat concerning this war which ye have waged against my people, or rather which thy brother hath waged against them, and which ye are still determined to carry on after his death.

 Behold, I would tell you somewhat concerning the justice of God, and the sword of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you except ye repent and withdraw your armies into your own lands, or the land of your possessions, which is the land of Nephi.

 Yea, I would tell you these things if ye were capable of hearkening unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful hell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy brother have been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your armies to your own lands.

 But as ye have once rejected these things, and have fought against the people of the Lord, even so I may expect you will do it again.

 And now behold, we are prepared to receive you; yea, and except you withdraw your purposes, behold, ye will pull down the wrath of that God whom you have rejected upon you, even to your utter destruction.

 But, as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you except ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited with death, for we will retain our cities and our lands; yea, and we will maintain our religion and the cause of our God.

 But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning these things in vain; or it supposeth me that thou art a child of hell; therefore I will close my epistle by telling you that I will not exchange prisoners, save it be on conditions that ye will deliver up a man and his wife and his children, for one prisoner; if this be the case that ye will do it, I will exchange.

 And behold, if ye do not this, I will come against you with my armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I will come against you, and I will follow you even into your own land, which is the land of our first inheritance; yea, and it shall be blood for blood, yea, life for life; and I will give you battle even until you are destroyed from off the face of the earth.

 Behold, I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves. But behold, if ye seek to destroy us more we will seek to destroy you; yea, and we will seek our land, the land of our first inheritance.

 Now I close my epistle. I am Moroni; I am a leader of the people of the Nephites.

 Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this epistle, was angry; and he wrote another epistle unto Moroni, and these are the words which he wrote, saying:

 I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of Amalickiah whom ye have murdered. Behold, I will avenge his blood upon you, yea, and I will come upon you with my armies for I fear not your threatenings.

 For behold, your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch that they did rob them of their right to the government when it rightly belonged unto them.

 And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject yourselves to be governed by those to whom the government doth rightly belong, then will I cause that my people shall lay down their weapons and shall be at war no more.

 Behold, ye have breathed out many threatenings against me and my people; but behold, we fear not your threatenings.

 Nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to your request, gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of war; and we will wage a war which shall be eternal, either to the subjecting the Nephites to our authority or to their eternal extinction.

 And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye; but if it so be that there is such a being, we know not but that he hath made us as well as you.

 And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will he not send you there to dwell with my brother whom ye have murdered, whom ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place? But behold these things matter not.

 I am Ammoron, and a descendant of Zoram, whom your fathers pressed and brought out of Jerusalem.

 And behold now, I am a bold Lamanite; behold, this war hath been waged to avenge their wrongs, and to maintain and to obtain their rights to the government; and I close my epistle to Moroni.

 Moroni, incensed at Ammoron's false assertions, refuses to exchange prisoners--Strategy secures release of captured Nephites--City of Gid taken without bloodshed.

 Now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he was more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of his fraud; yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it was not a just cause that had caused him to wage a war against the people of Nephi.

 And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron save he will withdraw his purpose, as I have stated in my epistle; for I will not grant unto him that he shall have any more power than what he hath got.

 Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my people whom they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not grant unto me mine epistle, behold, I will give unto him according to my words; yea, I will seek death among them until they shall sue for peace.

 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he caused that a search should be made among his men, that perhaps he might find a man who was a descendant of Laman among them.

 And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman; and he was one of the servants of the king who was murdered by Amalickiah.

 Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men should go forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.

 Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore Moroni appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men should go with him.

 And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over the Nephites, and behold, they saw him coming and they hailed him; but he saith unto them: Fear not; behold, I am a Lamanite. Behold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleep; and behold we have taken of their wine and brought with us.

 Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad that ye have thus taken wine with you for we are weary.

 But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go against the Nephites to battle. But this saying only made them more desirous to drink of the wine;

 For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strengthen us to go against the Nephites.

 And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.

 And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it was pleasant to their taste, therefore they took of it more freely; and it was strong, having been prepared in its strength.

 And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they were all drunken.

 And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and were in a deep sleep, they returned to Moroni and told him all the things that had happened.

 And now this was according to the design of Moroni. And Moroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep and drunken, and cast in weapons of war unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;

 Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as many as were able to use a weapon of war, when Moroni had armed all those prisoners; and all those things were done in a profound silence.

 But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken and the Nephites could have slain them.

 But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.

 But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners of the Nephites who were within the wall of the city, and had given them power to gain possession of those parts which were within the walls.

 And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.

 Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the Lamanites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within.

 And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief captains demanded their weapons of war, and they brought them forth and cast them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy.

 Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni. He took them prisoners of war, and took possession of the city, and caused that all the prisoners should be liberated, who were Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army.

 And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had taken prisoners, that they should commence a labor in strengthening the fortifications round about the city Gid.

 And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid, according to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be taken to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an exceedingly strong force.

 And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the intrigues of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners whom they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the advantage which they had retaken.

 And it came to pass that the Nephites began again to be victorious, and to reclaim their rights and their privileges.

 Many times did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night, but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners.

 And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine to the Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness.

 But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord their God in this their time of affliction. They could not be taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners.

 And they were thus cautious that no poison should be administered among them; for if their wine would poison a Lamanite it would also poison a Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors.

 And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make preparations to attack the city Morianton; for behold, the Lamanites had, by their labors, fortified the city Morianton until it had become an exceeding stronghold.

 And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and also new supplies of provisions.

 And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 Helaman's epistle to Moroni--Wonderful faith and valor of the stripling Ammonites--Another great battle--Nephites victorious.

 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges, on the second day in the first month, Moroni received an epistle from Helaman, stating the affairs of the people in that quarter of the land.

 And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the tribulations of our warfare; behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you concerning our warfare in this part of the land.

 Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought down out of the land of Nephi--now ye have known that these were descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our father Lehi;

 Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or their unbelief, for thou knowest concerning all these things--

 Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these young men have taken their weapons of war, and would that I should be their leader; and we have come forth to defend our country.

 And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their fathers made, that they would not take up their weapons of war against their brethren to shed blood.

 But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and our tribulations for them, they were about to break the covenant which they had made and take up their weapons of war in our defence.

 But I would not suffer them that they should break this covenant which they had made, supposing that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we should not suffer more because of the fulfilling the oath which they had taken.

 But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For behold, in the twenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of these two thousand young men to the city of Judea, to assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land.

 And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to be called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus did rejoice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to mourn.

 Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they have died in the cause of their country and of their God, yea, and they are happy.

 And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom are chief captains, for none other have they spared alive. And we suppose that they are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so if they are not slain.

 And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men;

 The land of Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah.

 And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to fortify the city.

 Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for they had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to maintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind.

 And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die; therefore you may well suppose that this little force which I brought with me, yea, those sons of mine, gave them great hopes and much joy.

 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a greater strength to his army, they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron to not come against the city of Judea, or against us, to battle.

 And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us in this our weakness they might have perhaps destroyed our little army; but thus were we preserved.

 They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which they had taken. And thus ended the twenty and sixth year. And in the commencement of the twenty and seventh year we had prepared our city and ourselves for defence.

 Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for we were not desirous to make an attack upon them in their strongholds.

 And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch the movements of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us by night nor by day to make an attack upon our other cities which were on the northward.

 For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by us, to fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the same time they were met in the front. We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were disappointed in this our desire.

 They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong and they should fall.

 Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.

 And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken.

 And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was brought unto us many provisions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons.

 And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of Zarahemla. And thus we were prepared with ten thousand men, and provisions for them, and also for their wives and their children.

 And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and provisions arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and began to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our receiving provisions and strength.

 Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise, we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them; therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth with my little sons to a neighboring city, as if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city.

 And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were going to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore.

 And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our provisions, to go to that city.

 And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part of his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city. But he did not march forth until I had gone forth with my little army, and came near the city Antiparah.

 And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army of the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous.

 And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their spies, they came forth with their army and marched against us.

 And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward. And thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites;

 Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this that they might not be surrounded by our people.

 And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army. But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night.

 And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the Lamanites were pursuing us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness.

 Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it was dark.

 And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning came we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them.

 But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month.

 And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they might catch us in their snare;

 Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to battle?

 And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.

 For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army of Antipus.

 Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.

 And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.

 And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand against these Lamanites who had pursued us. And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, and a terrible battle had commenced.

 The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they would have obtained their purpose.

 For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march--therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when Helaman came upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman.

 Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered together their men and came again upon the rear of the Lamanites.

 And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war.

 And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered themselves up unto us, behold, I numbered those young men who had fought with me, fearing lest there were many of them slain.

 But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.

 And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard them to keep them from the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we sent them to the land of Zarahemla, and a part of those men who were not slain of Antipus, with them; and the remainder I took and joined them to my stripling Ammonites, and took our march back to the city of Judea.

 Helaman's epistle continued--Antiparah retaken--City of Cumeni surrenders--Lamanites driven to Manti--A miraculous preservation--Escape of Lamanite prisoners.

 And now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron, the king, stating that if I would deliver up those prisoners of war whom we had taken that he would deliver up the city of Antiparah unto us.

 But I sent an epistle unto the king, that we were sure our forces were sufficient to take the city of Antiparah by our force; and by delivering up the prisoners for that city we should suppose ourselves unwise, and that we would only deliver up our prisoners on exchange.

 And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange prisoners; therefore we began to make preparations to go against the city of Antiparah.

 But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their other cities, which they had possession of, to fortify them; and thus the city of Antiparah fell into our hands.

 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.

 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and ninth year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an addition to our army, from the land of Zarahemla, and from the land round about, to the number of six thousand men, besides sixty of the sons of the Ammonites who had come to join their brethren, my little band of two thousand. And now behold, we were strong, yea, and we had also plenty of provisions brought unto us.

 And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with the army which was placed to protect the city Cumeni.

 And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our strong force, we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a little before they were to receive a supply of provisions.

 And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for many nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards, that the Lamanites could not come upon us by night and slay us, which they attempted many times; but as many times as they attempted this their blood was spilt.

 At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to enter the city by night. And we, instead of being Lamanites, were Nephites; therefore, we did take them and their provisions.

 And notwithstanding the Lamanites being cut off from their support after this manner, they were still determined to maintain the city; therefore it became expedient that we should take those provisions and send them to Judea, and our prisoners to the land of Zarahemla.

 And it came to pass that not many days had passed away before the Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they yielded up the city unto our hands; and thus we had accomplished our designs in obtaining the city Cumeni.

 But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous that, notwithstanding the enormity of our numbers, we were obliged to employ all our force to keep them, or to put them to death.

 For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would fight with stones, and with clubs, or whatsoever thing they could get into their hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.

 Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an end to their lives, or guard them, sword in hand, down to the land of Zarahemla; and also our provisions were not any more than sufficient for our own people, notwithstanding that which we had taken from the Lamanites.

 And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very serious matter to determine concerning these prisoners of war; nevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of Zarahemla; therefore we selected a part of our men, and gave them charge over our prisoners to go down to the land of Zarahemla.

 But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in season to save us from falling into their hands. For behold, Ammoron had sent to their support a new supply of provisions and also a numerous army of men.

 And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the prisoners did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to overpower us.

 But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer death unto all those who opposed them.

 And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted.

 Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them.

 And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great victory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore they were driven back to the city of Manti.

 And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.

 And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I immediately gave orders that my men who had been wounded should be taken from among the dead, and caused that their wounds should be dressed.

 And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds.

 And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe--that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.

 Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually.

 And now it came to pass that after we had thus taken care of our wounded men, and had buried our dead and also the dead of the Lamanites, who were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid concerning the prisoners whom they had started to go down to the land of Zarahemla with.

 Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to guard them down to the land.

 And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold, we did start to go down to the land of Zarahemla with our prisoners. And it came to pass that we did meet the spies of our armies, who had been sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites.

 And they cried unto us, saying--Behold, the armies of the Lamanites are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people.

 And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries, which caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us.

 And it came to pass because of their rebellion we did cause that our swords should come upon them. And it came to pass that they did in a body run upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke through and fled from us.

 And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we took our march with speed towards the city Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren in preserving the city.

 And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies. And blessed is the name of our God; for behold, it is he that has delivered us; yea, that has done this great thing for us.

 Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of Gid, I was filled with exceeding joy because of the goodness of God in preserving us, that we might not all perish; yea, and I trust that the souls of them who have been slain have entered into the rest of their God.

 Helaman's epistle concluded--Nephite operations before Manti--A Lamanite sortie--Gid and Teomner capture the city--Enemy withdraws.

 And behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain the city of Manti; but behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the city by our small bands. For behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto done; therefore we could not decoy them away from their strongholds.

 And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we durst not go forth and attack them in their strongholds.

 Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to the maintaining those parts of the land which we had regained of our possessions; therefore it became expedient that we should wait, that we might receive more strength from the land of Zarahemla and also a new supply of provisions.

 And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the governor of our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of our people. And it came to pass that we did wait to receive provisions and strength from the land of Zarahemla.

 But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites were also receiving great strength from day to day, and also many provisions; and thus were our circumstances at this period of time.

 And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to time, resolving by stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we could not come to battle with them, because of their retreats and their strongholds.

 And it came to pass that we did wait in these difficult circumstances for the space of many months, even until we were about to perish for the want of food.

 But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was guarded to us by an army of two thousand men to our assistance; and this is all the assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves and our country from falling into the hands of our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable.

 And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they did not send more strength unto us, we knew not; therefore we were grieved and also filled with fear, lest by any means the judgments of God should come upon our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction.

 Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people.

 Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.

 And we did take courage with our small force which we had received, and were fixed with a determination to conquer our enemies, and to maintain our lands, and our possessions, and our wives, and our children, and the cause of our liberty.

 And thus we did go forth with all our might against the Lamanites, who were in the city of Manti; and we did pitch our tents by the wilderness side, which was near to the city.

 And it came to pass that on the morrow, that when the Lamanites saw that we were in the borders by the wilderness which was near the city, that they sent out their spies round about us that they might discover the number and the strength of our army.

 And it came to pass that when they saw that we were not strong, according to our numbers, and fearing that we should cut them off from their support except they should come out to battle against us and kill us, and also supposing that they could easily destroy us with their numerous hosts, therefore they began to make preparations to come out against us to battle.

 And when we saw that they were making preparations to come out against us, behold, I caused that Gid, with a small number of men, should secrete himself in the wilderness, and also that Teomner and a small number of men should secrete themselves also in the wilderness.

 Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the left; and when they had thus secreted themselves, behold, I remained, with the remainder of my army, in that same place where we had first pitched our tents against the time that the Lamanites should come out to battle.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come out with their numerous army against us. And when they had come and were about to fall upon us with the sword, I caused that my men, those who were with me, should retreat into the wilderness.

 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did follow after us with great speed, for they were exceedingly desirous to overtake us that they might slay us; therefore they did follow us into the wilderness; and we did pass by in the midst of Gid and Teomner, insomuch that they were not discovered by the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had passed by, or when the army had passed by, Gid and Teomner did rise up from their secret places, and did cut off the spies of the Lamanites that they should not return to the city.

 And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to the city and fell upon the guards who were left to guard the city, insomuch that they did destroy them and did take possession of the city.

 Now this was done because the Lamanites did suffer their whole army, save a few guards only, to be led away into the wilderness.

 And it came to pass that Gid and Teomner by this means had obtained possession of their strongholds. And it came to pass that we took our course, after having traveled much in the wilderness towards the land of Zarahemla.

 And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards the land of Zarahemla, they were exceedingly afraid, lest there was a plan laid to lead them on to destruction; therefore they began to retreat into the wilderness again, yea, even back by the same way which they had come.

 And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for the chief captains of the Lamanites had supposed that the Nephites were weary because of their march; and supposing that they had driven their whole army therefore they took no thought concerning the city of Manti.

 Now it came to pass that when it was night, I caused that my men should not sleep, but that they should march forward by another way towards the land of Manti.

 And because of this our march in the night-time, behold, on the morrow we were beyond the Lamanites, insomuch that we did arrive before them at the city of Manti.

 And thus it came to pass, that by this stratagem we did take possession of the city of Manti without the shedding of blood.

 And it came to pass that when the armies of the Lamanites did arrive near the city, and saw that we were prepared to meet them, they were astonished exceedingly and struck with great fear, insomuch that they did flee into the wilderness.

 Yea, and it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did flee out of all this quarter of the land. But behold, they have carried with them many women and children out of the land.

 And those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all of them are at this period of time in our possession; and our fathers and our women and our children are returning to their homes, all save it be those who have been taken prisoners and carried off by the Lamanites.

 But behold, our armies are small to maintain so great a number of cities and so great possessions.

 But behold, we trust in our God who has given us victory over those lands, insomuch that we have obtained those cities and those lands, which were our own.

 Now we do not know the cause that the government does not grant us more strength; neither do those men who came up unto us know why we have not received greater strength.

 Behold, we do not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye have drawn away the forces into that quarter of the land; if so, we do not desire to murmur.

 And if it is not so, behold, we fear that there is some faction in the government, that they do not send more men to our assistance; for we know that they are more numerous than that which they have sent.

 But, behold, it mattereth not--we trust God will deliver us, notwithstanding the weakness of our armies, yea, and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies.

 Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end, and we are in the possession of our lands; and the Lamanites have fled to the land of Nephi.

 And those sons of the people of Ammon, of whom I have so highly spoken, are with me in the city of Manti; and the Lord has supported them, yea, and kept them from falling by the sword, insomuch that even one soul has not been slain.

 But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come.

 And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God, who has redeemed us and made us free, keep you continually in his presence; yea, and may he favor this people, even that ye may have success in obtaining the possession of all that which the Lamanites have taken from us, which was for our support. And now, behold, I close mine epistle. I am Helaman, the son of Alma.

 Moroni writes to Pahoran, asking reenforcements for Helaman--City of Nephihah taken by Lamanites--Moroni's anger at seeming indifference of the government.

 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, after Moroni had received and had read Helaman's epistle, he was exceedingly rejoiced because of the welfare, yea, the exceeding success which Helaman had had, in obtaining those lands which were lost.

 Yea, and he did make it known unto all his people, in all the land round about in that part where he was, that they might rejoice also.

 And it came to pass that he immediately sent an epistle to Pahoran, desiring that he should cause men to be gathered together to strengthen Helaman, or the armies of Helaman, insomuch that he might with ease maintain that part of the land which he had been so miraculously prospered in regaining.

 And it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle to the land of Zarahemla, he began again to lay a plan that he might obtain the remainder of those possessions and cities which the Lamanites had taken from them.

 And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus making preparations to go against the Lamanites to battle, behold, the people of Nephihah, who were gathered together from the city of Moroni and the city of Lehi and the city of Morianton, were attacked by the Lamanites.

 Yea, even those who had been compelled to flee from the land of Manti, and from the land round about, had come over and joined the Lamanites in this part of the land.

 And thus being exceedingly numerous, yea, and receiving strength from day to day, by the command of Ammoron they came forth against the people of Nephihah, and they did begin to slay them with an exceedingly great slaughter.

 And their armies were so numerous that the remainder of the people of Nephihah were obliged to flee before them; and they came even and joined the army of Moroni.

 And now as Moroni had supposed that there should be men sent to the city of Nephihah, to the assistance of the people to maintain that city, and knowing that it was easier to keep the city from falling into the hands of the Lamanites than to retake it from them, he supposed that they would easily maintain that city.

 Therefore he retained all his force to maintain those places which he had recovered.

 And now, when Moroni saw that the city of Nephihah was lost he was exceedingly sorrowful, and began to doubt, because of the wickedness of the people, whether they should not fall into the hands of their brethren.

 Now this was the case with all his chief captains. They doubted and marveled also because of the wickedness of the people, and this because of the success of the Lamanites over them.

 And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country.

 Moroni's second epistle to Pahoran--Complains of neglect--Demands immediate help on peril of reprisal.

 And it came to pass that he wrote again to the governor of the land, who was Pahoran, and these are the words which he wrote, saying: Behold, I direct mine epistle to Pahoran, in the city of Zarahemla, who is the chief judge and the governor over the land, and also to all those who have been chosen by this people to govern and manage the affairs of this war.

 For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of condemnation; for behold, ye yourselves know that ye have been appointed to gather together men, and arm them with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war of every kind, and send forth against the Lamanites, in whatsoever parts they should come into our land.

 And now behold, I say unto you that myself, and also my men, and also Helaman and his men, have suffered exceedingly great sufferings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and all manner of afflictions of every kind.

 But behold, were this all we had suffered we would not murmur nor complain.

 But behold, great has been the slaughter among our people; yea, thousands have fallen by the sword, while it might have otherwise been if ye had rendered unto our armies sufficient strength and succor for them. Yea, great has been your neglect towards us.

 And now behold, we desire to know the cause of this exceedingly great neglect; yea, we desire to know the cause of your thoughtless state.

 Can you think to sit upon your thrones in a state of thoughtless stupor, while your enemies are spreading the work of death around you? Yea, while they are murdering thousands of your brethren--

 Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have placed you in a situation that ye might have succored them, yea, ye might have sent armies unto them, to have strengthened them, and have saved thousands of them from falling by the sword.

 But behold, this is not all--ye have withheld your provisions from them, insomuch that many have fought and bled out their lives because of their great desires which they had for the welfare of this people; yea, and this they have done when they were about to perish with hunger, because of your exceedingly great neglect towards them.

 And now, my beloved brethren--for ye ought to be beloved; yea, and ye ought to have stirred yourselves more diligently for the welfare and the freedom of this people; but behold, ye have neglected them insomuch that the blood of thousands shall come upon your heads for vengeance; yea, for known unto God were all their cries, and all their sufferings--

 Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and because of the exceeding goodness of God ye could do nothing and he would deliver you? Behold, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain.

 Do ye suppose that, because so many of your brethren have been killed it is because of their wickedness? I say unto you, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain; for I say unto you, there are many who have fallen by the sword; and behold it is to your condemnation;

 For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need not suppose that the righteous are lost because they are slain; but behold, they do enter into the rest of the Lord their God.

 And now behold, I say unto you, I fear exceedingly that the judgments of God will come upon this people, because of their exceeding slothfulness, yea, even the slothfulness of our government, and their exceedingly great neglect towards their brethren, yea, towards those who have been slain.

 For were it not for the wickedness which first commenced at our head, we could have withstood our enemies that they could have gained no power over us.

 Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out among ourselves; yea, were it not for these king-men, who caused so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, at the time we were contending among ourselves, if we had united our strength as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been for the desire of power and authority which those king-men had over us; had they been true to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against our enemies, instead of taking up their swords against us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth against them in the strength of the Lord, we should have dispersed our enemies, for it would have been done, according to the fulfilling of his word.

 But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, taking possession of our lands, and they are murdering our people with the sword, yea, our women and our children, and also carrying them away captive, causing them that they should suffer all manner of afflictions, and this because of the great wickedness of those who are seeking for power and authority, yea, even those king-men.

 But why should I say much concerning this matter? For we know not but what ye yourselves are seeking for authority. We know not but what ye are also traitors to your country.

 Or is it that ye have neglected us because ye are in the heart of our country and ye are surrounded by security, that ye do not cause food to be sent unto us, and also men to strengthen our armies?

 Have ye forgotten the commandments of the Lord your God? Yea, have ye forgotten the captivity of our fathers? Have ye forgotten the many times we have been delivered out of the hands of our enemies?

 Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while we sit upon our thrones and do not make use of the means which the Lord has provided for us?

 Yea, will ye sit in idleness while ye are surrounded with thousands of those, yea, and tens of thousands, who do also sit in idleness, while there are thousands round about in the borders of the land who are falling by the sword, yea, wounded and bleeding?

 Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while ye sit still and behold these things? Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now I would that ye should remember that God has said that the inward vessel shall be cleansed first, and then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also.

 And now, except ye do repent of that which ye have done, and begin to be up and doing, and send forth food and men unto us, and also unto Helaman, that he may support those parts of our country which he has regained, and that we may also recover the remainder of our possessions in these parts, behold it will be expedient that we contend no more with the Lamanites until we have first cleansed our inward vessel, yea, even the great head of our government.

 And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto me a true spirit of freedom, and strive to strengthen and fortify our armies, and grant unto them food for their support, behold I will leave a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our land, and I will leave the strength and the blessings of God upon them, that none other power can operate against them--

 And this because of their exceeding faith, and their patience in their tribulations--

 And I will come unto you, and if there be any among you that has a desire for freedom, yea, if there be even a spark of freedom remaining, behold I will stir up insurrections among you, even until those who have desires to usurp power and authority shall become extinct.

 Yea, behold I do not fear your power nor your authority, but it is my God whom I fear; and it is according to his commandments that I do take my sword to defend the cause of my country, and it is because of your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss.

 Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that except ye do bestir yourselves in the defence of your country and your little ones, the sword of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it shall fall upon you and visit you even to your utter destruction.

 Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, except ye do administer unto our relief, behold, I come unto you, even in the land of Zarahemla, and smite you with the sword, insomuch that ye can have no more power to impede the progress of this people in the cause of our freedom.

 For behold, the Lord will not suffer that ye shall live and wax strong in your iniquities to destroy his righteous people.

 Behold, can you suppose that the Lord will spare you and come out in judgment against the Lamanites, when it is the tradition of their fathers that has caused their hatred, yea, and it has been redoubled by those who have dissented from us, while your iniquity is for the cause of your love of glory and the vain things of the world?

 Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know that ye do trample them under your feet. Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle against them.

 And now behold, I, Moroni, am constrained, according to the covenant which I have made to keep the commandments of my God; therefore I would that ye should adhere to the word of God, and send speedily unto me of your provisions and of your men, and also to Helaman.

 And behold, if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily; for behold, God will not suffer that we should perish with hunger; therefore he will give unto us of your food, even if it must be by the sword. Now see that ye fulfil the word of God.

 Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain. I seek not for power, but to pull it down. I seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my country. And thus I close mine epistle.

 Pahoran's patriotic reply--He exonerates himself and the freemen--Nephite state tottering--Governor appeals for military aid against rebels.

 Behold, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his epistle unto the chief governor, he received an epistle from Pahoran, the chief governor. And these are the words which he received:

 I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army. Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.

 But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea, insomuch that they have risen up in rebellion against me, and also those of my people who are freemen, yea, and those who have risen up are exceedingly numerous.

 And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great flattery, and they have led away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our freemen that they have not come unto you.

 And behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have fled to the land of Gideon, with as many men as it were possible that I could get.

 And behold, I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of the land; and behold, they are flocking to us daily, to their arms, in the defence of their country and their freedom, and to avenge our wrongs.

 And they have come unto us, insomuch that those who have risen up in rebellion against us are set at defiance, yea, insomuch that they do fear us and durst not come out against us to battle.

 They have got possession of the land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they have appointed a king over them, and he hath written unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an alliance with him; in the which alliance he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the land, and he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be conquered under the Lamanites.

 And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I, Pahoran, do not seek for power, save only to retain my judgment-seat that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My soul standeth fast in that liberty in the which God hath made us free.

 And now, behold, we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed. We would not shed the blood of the Lamanites if they would stay in their own land.

 We would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not rise up in rebellion and take the sword against us.

 We would subject ourselves to the yoke of bondage if it were requisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so to do.

 But behold he doth not command us that we shall subject ourselves to our enemies, but that we should put our trust in him, and he will deliver us.

 Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words, yea, such as rebellions and dissensions, let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church, and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.

 Therefore, come unto me speedily with a few of your men, and leave the remainder in the charge of Lehi and Teancum; give unto them power to conduct the war in that part of the land, according to the Spirit of God, which is also the spirit of freedom which is in them.

 Behold I have sent a few provisions unto them, that they may not perish until ye can come unto me.

 Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march hither, and we will go speedily against those dissenters, in the strength of our God according to the faith which is in us.

 And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we may obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go forth against them in the strength of the Lord, and we will put an end to this great iniquity.

 And now, Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I was somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it should be just in us to go against our brethren.

 But ye have said, except they repent the Lord hath commanded you that ye should go against them.

 See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell them to fear not, for God will deliver them, yea, and also all those who stand fast in that liberty wherewith God hath made them free. And now I close mine epistle to my beloved brother, Moroni.

 Moroni marches to relief of Pahoran--Zarahemla recaptured from the rebels--Help sent to Helaman, Lehi, and Teancum--Lamanites concentrate in land of Moroni--Teancum slays Ammoron, at cost of his own life--Lamanites driven out of the land.

 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle his heart did take courage, and was filled with exceedingly great joy because of the faithfulness of Pahoran, that he was not also a traitor to the freedom and cause of his country.

 But he did also mourn exceedingly because of the iniquity of those who had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine because of those who had rebelled against their country and also their God.

 And it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men, according to the desire of Pahoran, and gave Lehi and Teancum command over the remainder of his army, and took his march towards the land of Gideon.

 And he did raise the standard of liberty in whatsoever place he did enter, and gained whatsoever force he could in all his march towards the land of Gideon.

 And it came to pass that thousands did flock unto his standard, and did take up their swords in the defence of their freedom, that they might not come into bondage.

 And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he could in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his forces with those of Pahoran they became exceedingly strong, even stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the king of those dissenters who had driven the freemen out of the land of Zarahemla and had taken possession of the land.

 And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran went down with their armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the city, and did meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did come to battle.

 And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners, and Pahoran was restored to his judgment-seat.

 And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also those king-men who had been taken and cast into prison; and they were executed according to the law; yea, those men of Pachus and those king-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country, but would fight against it, were put to death.

 And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly observed for the safety of their country; yea, and whosoever was found denying their freedom was speedily executed according to the law.

 And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; Moroni and Pahoran having restored peace to the land of Zarahemla, among their own people, having inflicted death upon all those who were not true to the cause of freedom.

 And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni immediately caused that provisions should be sent, and also an army of six thousand men should be sent unto Helaman, to assist him in preserving that part of the land.

 And he also caused that an army of six thousand men, with a sufficient quantity of food, should be sent to the armies of Lehi and Teancum. And it came to pass that this was done to fortify the land against the Lamanites.

 And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a large body of men in the land of Zarahemla, took their march with a large body of men towards the land of Nephihah, being determined to overthrow the Lamanites in that city.

 And it came to pass that as they were marching towards the land, they took a large body of men of the Lamanites, and slew many of them, and took their provisions and their weapons of war.

 And it came to pass after they had taken them, they caused them to enter into a covenant that they would no more take up their weapons of war against the Nephites.

 And when they had entered into this covenant they sent them to dwell with the people of Ammon, and they were in number about four thousand who had not been slain.

 And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they pursued their march towards the land of Nephihah. And it came to pass that when they had come to the city of Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which is near the city of Nephihah.

 Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to battle against them, upon the plains; but the Lamanites, knowing of their exceedingly great courage, and beholding the greatness of their numbers, therefore they durst not come out against them; therefore they did not come to battle in that day.

 And when the night came, Moroni went forth in the darkness of the night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the city the Lamanites did camp with their army.

 And it came to pass that they were on the east, by the entrance; and they were all asleep. And now Moroni returned to his army, and caused that they should prepare in haste strong cords and ladders, to be let down from the top of the wall into the inner part of the wall.

 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men should march forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves down into that part of the city, yea, even on the west, where the Lamanites did not camp with their armies.

 And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city by night, by the means of their strong cords and their ladders; thus when the morning came they were all within the walls of the city.

 And now, when the Lamanites awoke and saw that the armies of Moroni were within the walls, they were affrighted exceedingly, insomuch that they did flee out by the pass.

 And now when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he did cause that his men should march forth against them, and slew many, and surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and the remainder of them fled into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.

 Thus had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the possession of the city of Nephihah without the loss of one soul; and there were many of the Lamanites who were slain.

 Now it came to pass that many of the Lamanites that were prisoners were desirous to join the people of Ammon and become a free people.

 And it came to pass that as many as were desirous, unto them it was granted according to their desires.

 Therefore, all the prisoners of the Lamanites did join the people of Ammon, and did begin to labor exceedingly, tilling the ground, raising all manner of grain, and flocks and herds of every kind; and thus were the Nephites relieved from a great burden; yea, insomuch that they were relieved from all the prisoners of the Lamanites.

 Now it came to pass that Moroni, after he had obtained possession of the city of Nephihah, having taken many prisoners, which did reduce the armies of the Lamanites exceedingly, and having regained many of the Nephites who had been taken prisoners, which did strengthen the army of Moroni exceedingly; therefore Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land of Lehi.

 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Moroni was coming against them, they were again frightened and fled before the army of Moroni.

 And it came to pass that Moroni and his army did pursue them from city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the Lamanites fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the borders by the seashore, until they came to the land of Moroni.

 And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, insomuch that they were all in one body in the land of Moroni. Now Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them.

 And it came to pass that Moroni and Lehi and Teancum did encamp with their armies round about in the borders of the land of Moroni, insomuch that the Lamanites were encircled about in the borders by the wilderness on the south, and in the borders by the wilderness on the east.

 And thus they did encamp for the night. For behold, the Nephites and the Lamanites also were weary because of the greatness of the march; therefore they did not resolve upon any stratagem in the night-time, save it were Teancum; for he was exceedingly angry with Ammoron, insomuch that he considered that Ammoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been the cause of this great and lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had been the cause of so much war and bloodshed, yea, and so much famine.

 And it came to pass that Teancum in his anger did go forth into the camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the walls of the city. And he went forth with a cord, from place to place, insomuch that he did find the king; and he did cast a javelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart. But behold, the king did awaken his servants before he died, insomuch that they did pursue Teancum, and slew him.

 Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who had fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions. But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth.

 Now it came to pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow, and came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them with a great slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land; and they did flee, even that they did not return at that time against the Nephites.

 And thus ended the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and thus they had had wars, and bloodsheds, and famine, and affliction, for the space of many years.

 And there had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions, and all manner of iniquity among the people of Nephi; nevertheless for the righteous' sake, yea, because of the prayers of the righteous, they were spared.

 But behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the war between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility.

 And it came to pass that after Moroni had fortified those parts of the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites, until they were sufficiently strong, he returned to the city of Zarahemla; and also Helaman returned to the place of his inheritance; and there was once more peace established among the people of Nephi.

 And Moroni yielded up the command of his armies into the hands of his son, whose name was Moronihah; and he retired to his own house that he might spend the remainder of his days in peace.

 And Pahoran did return to his judgment-seat; and Helaman did take upon him again to preach unto the people the word of God; for because of so many wars and contentions it had become expedient that a regulation should be made again in the church.

 Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth, and did declare the word of God with much power unto the convincing of many people of their wickedness, which did cause them to repent of their sins and to be baptized unto the Lord their God.

 And it came to pass that they did establish again the church of God, throughout all the land.

 Yea, and regulations were made concerning the law. And their judges, and their chief judges were chosen.

 And the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to multiply and to wax exceedingly strong again in the land. And they began to grow exceedingly rich.

 But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their prosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of their eyes; neither were they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they did humble themselves exceedingly before him.

 Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for them, that he had delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and from all manner of afflictions, and he had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies.

 And they did pray unto the Lord their God continually, insomuch that the Lord did bless them, according to his word, so that they did wax strong and prosper in the land.

 And it came to pass that all these things were done. And Helaman died, in the thirty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 Shiblon succeeds Helaman--Death of Moroni--Hagoth, builder of ships--Nephite voyages to the land northward--Helaman, son of Helaman, keeps the records--Moronihah defeats Lamanites--End of Alma's account.

 And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Shiblon took possession of those sacred things which had been delivered unto Helaman by Alma.

 And he was a just man, and he did walk uprightly before God; and he did observe to do good continually, to keep the commandments of the Lord his God; and also did his brother.

 And it came to pass that Moroni died also. And thus ended the thirty and sixth year of the reign of the judges.

 And it came to pass that in the thirty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, there was a large company of men, even to the amount of five thousand and four hundred men, with their wives and their children, departed out of the land of Zarahemla into the land which was northward.

 And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.

 And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and children; and they took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh year.

 And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships. And the first ship did also return, and many more people did enter into it; and they also took much provisions, and set out again to the land northward.

 And it came to pass that they were never heard of more. And we suppose that they were drowned in the depths of the sea. And it came to pass that one other ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go we know not.

 And it came to pass that in this year there were many people who went forth into the land northward. And thus ended the thirty and eighth year.

 And it came to pass in the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, Shiblon died also, and Corianton had gone forth to the land northward in a ship, to carry forth provisions unto the people who had gone forth into that land.

 Therefore it became expedient for Shiblon to confer those sacred things, before his death, upon the son of Helaman, who was called Helaman, being called after the name of his father.

 Now behold, all those engravings which were in the possession of Helaman were written and sent forth among the children of men throughout all the land, save it were those parts which had been commanded by Alma should not go forth.

 Nevertheless, these things were to be kept sacred, and handed down from one generation to another; therefore, in this year, they had been conferred upon Helaman, before the death of Shiblon.

 And it came to pass also in this year that there were some dissenters who had gone forth unto the Lamanites; and they were stirred up again to anger against the Nephites.

 And also in this same year they came down with a numerous army to war against the people of Moronihah, or against the army of Moronihah, in the which they were beaten and driven back again to their own lands, suffering great loss.

 And thus ended the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

 And thus ended the account of Alma, and Helaman his son, and also Shiblon, who was his son.


First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

Second Citizen:
One word, good citizens.

First Citizen:
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Citizen:
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

All:
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.

Second Citizen:
Consider you what services he has done for his country?

First Citizen:
Very well; and could be content to give him good
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.

Second Citizen:
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

First Citizen:
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, even till the altitude of his virtue.

Second Citizen:
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

First Citizen:
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!

All:
Come, come.

First Citizen:
Soft! who comes here?

Second Citizen:
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
the people.

First Citizen:
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!

MENENIUS:
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.

First Citizen:
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.

MENENIUS:
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves?

First Citizen:
We cannot, sir, we are undone already.

MENENIUS:
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen:
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
there's all the love they bear us.

MENENIUS:
Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale 't a little more.

First Citizen:
Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
you, deliver.

MENENIUS:
There was a time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
That only like a gulf it did remain
I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--

First Citizen:
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MENENIUS:
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you.

First Citizen:
Your belly's answer? What!
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
With other muniments and petty helps
In this our fabric, if that they--

MENENIUS:
What then?
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?

First Citizen:
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
Who is the sink o' the body,--

MENENIUS:
Well, what then?

First Citizen:
The former agents, if they did complain,
What could the belly answer?

MENENIUS:
I will tell you
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.

First Citizen:
Ye're long about it.

MENENIUS:
Note me this, good friend;
Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
'That I receive the general food at first,
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because I am the store-house and the shop
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--

First Citizen:
Ay, sir; well, well.

MENENIUS:
'Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the flour of all,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?

First Citizen:
It was an answer: how apply you this?

MENENIUS:
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
You, the great toe of this assembly?

First Citizen:
I the great toe! why the great toe?

MENENIUS:
For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
The one side must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS:
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?

First Citizen:
We have ever your good word.

MARCIUS:
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it.
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
With every minute you do change a mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?

MENENIUS:
For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
The city is well stored.

MARCIUS:
Hang 'em! They say!
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
Who thrives and who declines; side factions
and give out
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
grain enough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
As I could pick my lance.

MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
What says the other troop?

MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a petition granted them, a strange one--
To break the heart of generosity,
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS:
What is granted them?

MARCIUS:
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS:
This is strange.

MARCIUS:
Go, get you home, you fragments!

Messenger:
Where's Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS:
Here: what's the matter?

Messenger:
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS:
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

First Senator:
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
The Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS:
They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS:
You have fought together.

MARCIUS:
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.

First Senator:
Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS:
It is your former promise.

MARCIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

TITUS:
No, Caius Marcius;
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
Ere stay behind this business.

MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!

First Senator:
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends attend us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!

First Senator:

MARCIUS:
Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.

SICINIUS:
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS:
He has no equal.

SICINIUS:
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--

BRUTUS:
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

SICINIUS:
Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTUS:
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS:
Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS:
The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.

SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the which he aims,
In whom already he's well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the business!'

SICINIUS:
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS:
Let's hence, and hear
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.

BRUTUS:
Lets along.

First Senator:
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
And know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

First Senator:
Our army's in the field
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must show themselves; which
in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.

Second Senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
If they set down before 's, for the remove
Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
They've not prepared for us.

AUFIDIUS:
O, doubt not that;
I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

All:
The gods assist you!

AUFIDIUS:
And keep your honours safe!

First Senator:
Farewell.

Second Senator:
Farewell.

All:
Farewell.

VOLUMNIA:
I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
how honour would become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
But had he died in the business, madam; how then?

VOLUMNIA:
Then his good report should have been my son; I
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

Gentlewoman:
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

VIRGILIA:
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, you shall not.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his hire.

VIRGILIA:
His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA:
Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
We are fit to bid her welcome.

VIRGILIA:
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA:
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
And tread upon his neck.

VALERIA:
My ladies both, good day to you.

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA:
I am glad to see your ladyship.

VALERIA:
How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. How does your little son?

VIRGILIA:
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA:
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
look upon his school-master.

VALERIA:
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
again; and after it again; and over and over he
comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
it!

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's father's moods.

VALERIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.

VALERIA:
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
the idle husewife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA:
Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
threshold till my lord return from the wars.

VALERIA:
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA:
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
my prayers; but I cannot go thither.

VOLUMNIA:
Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA:
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA:
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.

VALERIA:
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
excellent news of your husband.

VIRGILIA:
O, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA:
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
him last night.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA:
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.

VIRGILIA:
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
thing hereafter.

VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
disease our better mirth.

VALERIA:
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
solemness out o' door. and go along with us.

VIRGILIA:
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
you much mirth.

VALERIA:
Well, then, farewell.

MARCIUS:
Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.

MARCIUS:
'Tis done.

LARTIUS:
Agreed.

MARCIUS:
Say, has our general met the enemy?

Messenger:
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS:
So, the good horse is mine.

MARCIUS:
I'll buy him of you.

LARTIUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS:
How far off lie these armies?

Messenger:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

First Senator:
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
That's lesser than a little.
Hark! our drums
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of themselves.
Hark you. far off!
There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army.

MARCIUS:
O, they are at it!

LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

MARCIUS:
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge.

MARCIUS:
All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Further than seen and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

First Soldier:
Fool-hardiness; not I.

Second Soldier:
Nor I.

First Soldier:
See, they have shut him in.

All:
To the pot, I warrant him.

LARTIUS:
What is become of Marcius?

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Soldier:
Following the fliers at the very heels,
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
To answer all the city.

LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.

First Soldier:
Look, sir.

LARTIUS:
O,'tis Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

First Roman:
This will I carry to Rome.

Second Roman:
And I this.

Third Roman:
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.

MARCIUS:
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.

LARTIUS:
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Thy exercise hath been too violent for
A second course of fight.

MARCIUS:
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.

LARTIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page!

MARCIUS:
Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.

LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
Call thither all the officers o' the town,
Where they shall know our mind: away!

COMINIUS:
Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling
fronts encountering,
May give you thankful sacrifice.
Thy news?

Messenger:
The citizens of Corioli have issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away.

COMINIUS:
Though thou speak'st truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well.
How long is't since?

Messenger:
Above an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS:
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And bring thy news so late?

Messenger:
Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Half an hour since brought my report.

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him thus.

MARCIUS:

COMINIUS:
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.

MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How is it with Titus Lartius?

MARCIUS:
As with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him slip at will.

COMINIUS:
Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? call him hither.

MARCIUS:
Let him alone;
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they.

COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd you?

MARCIUS:
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS:
How lies their battle? know you on which side
They have placed their men of trust?

COMINIUS:
As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS:
I do beseech you,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you not delay the present, but,
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
We prove this very hour.

COMINIUS:
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best can aid your action.

MARCIUS:
Those are they
That most are willing. If any such be here--
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? none of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I select
from all: the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.

LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
We cannot keep the town.

Lieutenant:
Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.

MARCIUS:
I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS:
Let the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS:
If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS:
Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest.

AUFIDIUS:
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
In your condemned seconds.

COMINIUS:
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
dull tribunes,
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully dined before.

LARTIUS:
O general,
Here is the steed, we the caparison:
Hadst thou beheld--

MARCIUS:
Pray now, no more: my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done; that's what I can; induced
As you have been; that's for my country:
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS:
You shall not be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
To hide your doings; and to silence that,
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
In sign of what you are, not to reward
What you have done--before our army hear me.

MARCIUS:
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
To hear themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS:
Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the common distribution, at
Your only choice.

MARCIUS:
I thank you, general;
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing.

MARCIUS:
May these same instruments, which you profane,
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
Made all of false-faced soothing!
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my little should be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly: by your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
For what he did before Corioli, call him,
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
The addition nobly ever!

All:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.

COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate,
For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS:
I shall, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my lord general.

COMINIUS:
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?

CORIOLANUS:
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
To give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS:
Marcius, his name?

CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
Go we to our tent:
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to: come.

AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en!

First Soldier:
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
What good condition can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.

First Soldier:
He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.

First Soldier:
Will not you go?

AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

First Soldier:
I shall, sir.

MENENIUS:
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.

BRUTUS:
Good or bad?

MENENIUS:
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
love not Marcius.

SICINIUS:
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, who does the wolf love?

SICINIUS:
The lamb.

MENENIUS:
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
noble Marcius.

BRUTUS:
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

MENENIUS:
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

Both:
Well, sir.

MENENIUS:
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
have not in abundance?

BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.

BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boasting.

MENENIUS:
This is strange now: do you two know how you are
censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
right-hand file? do you?

Both:
Why, how are we censured?

MENENIUS:
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?

Both:
Well, well, sir, well.

MENENIUS:
Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
being proud?

BRUTUS:
We do it not alone, sir.

MENENIUS:
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
single: your abilities are too infant-like for
doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
O that you could!

BRUTUS:
What then, sir?

MENENIUS:
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
any in Rome.

SICINIUS:
Menenius, you are known well enough too.

MENENIUS:
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
compound with the major part of your syllables: and
though I must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
well enough too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
known well enough too?

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
pinched with the colic, you make faces like
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS:
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worships: more of your conversation would
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
your eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
the love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
approbation.

MENENIUS:
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay,'tis true.

VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
at home for you.

MENENIUS:
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
me!

VIRGILIA:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS:
A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.

VIRGILIA:
O, no, no, no.

VOLUMNIA:
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.

MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA:
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
with the oaken garland.

MENENIUS:
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA:
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
Aufidius got off.

MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly

VALERIA:
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
true purchasing.

VIRGILIA:
The gods grant them true!

VOLUMNIA:
True! pow, wow.

MENENIUS:
True! I'll be sworn they are true.
Where is he wounded?
God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA:
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.

MENENIUS:
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
nine that I know.

VOLUMNIA:
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.

MENENIUS:
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
Hark! the trumpets.

VOLUMNIA:
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.

Herald:
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
In honour follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

All:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother!

CORIOLANUS:
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, my good soldier, up;
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
But O, thy wife!

CORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.

MENENIUS:
Now, the gods crown thee!

CORIOLANUS:
And live you yet?
O my sweet lady, pardon.

VOLUMNIA:
I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.

MENENIUS:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old crab-trees here
at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
We call a nettle but a nettle and
The faults of fools but folly.

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

CORIOLANUS:
Menenius ever, ever.

Herald:
Give way there, and go on!

CORIOLANUS:

VOLUMNIA:
I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy: only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS:
Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

SICINIUS:
He cannot temperately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS:
In that there's comfort.

SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours, which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do't.

BRUTUS:
I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.

BRUTUS:
It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS:
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.

BRUTUS:
'Tis most like he will.

SICINIUS:
It shall be to him then as our good wills,
A sure destruction.

BRUTUS:
So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
In human action and capacity,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in the war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

SICINIUS:
This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.

BRUTUS:
What's the matter?

Messenger:
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Marcius shall be consul:
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
I never saw the like.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol;
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
But hearts for the event.

SICINIUS:
Have with you.

First Officer:
Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
for consulships?

Second Officer:
Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
Coriolanus will carry it.

First Officer:
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
loves not the common people.

Second Officer:
Faith, there had been many great men that have
flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
be many that they have loved, they know not
wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly see't.

First Officer:
If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him; and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes, to flatter them for their love.

Second Officer:
He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
having been supple and courteous to the people,
bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.

First Officer:
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
are coming.

MENENIUS:
Having determined of the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
please you,
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
The present consul, and last general
In our well-found successes, to report
A little of that worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
We met here both to thank and to remember
With honours like himself.

First Senator:
Speak, good Cominius:
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Rather our state's defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out.
Masters o' the people,
We do request your kindest ears, and after,
Your loving motion toward the common body,
To yield what passes here.

SICINIUS:
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly.

BRUTUS:
Which the rather
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at.

MENENIUS:
That's off, that's off;
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?

BRUTUS:
Most willingly;
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it.

MENENIUS:
He loves your people
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your place.

First Senator:
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
What you have nobly done.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's pardon:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir: yet oft,
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
your people,
I love them as they weigh.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS:
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.

MENENIUS:
Masters of the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.

MENENIUS:
Worthy man!

First Senator:
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.

COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world: he covets less
Than misery itself would give; rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To spend the time to end it.

MENENIUS:
He's right noble:
Let him be call'd for.

First Senator:
Call Coriolanus.

Officer:
He doth appear.

MENENIUS:
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
To make thee consul.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still
My life and services.

MENENIUS:
It then remains
That you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
I do beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
That I may pass this doing.

SICINIUS:
Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony.

MENENIUS:
Put them not to't:
Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Your honour with your form.

CORIOLANUS:
It is apart
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.

BRUTUS:
Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS:
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire
Of their breath only!

MENENIUS:
Do not stand upon't.
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.

Senators:
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!

BRUTUS:
You see how he intends to use the people.

SICINIUS:
May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give.

BRUTUS:
Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
I know, they do attend us.

First Citizen:
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.

Second Citizen:
We may, sir, if we will.

Third Citizen:
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members.

First Citizen:
And to make us no better thought of, a little help
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.

Third Citizen:
We have been called so of many; not that our heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o' the compass.

Second Citizen:
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?

Third Citizen:
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Citizen:
Why that way?

Third Citizen:
To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.

Second Citizen:
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.

Third Citizen:
Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
say, if he would incline to the people, there was
never a worthier man.
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
by threes. He's to make his requests by
particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
you shall go by him.

All:
Content, content.

MENENIUS:
O sir, you are not right: have you not known
The worthiest men have done't?

CORIOLANUS:
What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the noise of our own drums.'

MENENIUS:
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that: you must desire them
To think upon you.

CORIOLANUS:
Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.

MENENIUS:
You'll mar all:
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.

CORIOLANUS:
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
So, here comes a brace.
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.

Third Citizen:
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.

CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert.

Second Citizen:
Your own desert!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but not mine own desire.

Third Citizen:
How not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging.

Third Citizen:
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
gain by you.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?

First Citizen:
The price is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS:
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
good voice, sir; what say you?

Second Citizen:
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
begged. I have your alms: adieu.

Third Citizen:
But this is something odd.

Second Citizen:
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul, I have here the
customary gown.

Fourth Citizen:
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
have not deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma?

Fourth Citizen:
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
the common people.

CORIOLANUS:
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
I may be consul.

Fifth Citizen:
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
you our voices heartily.

Fourth Citizen:
You have received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS:
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.

Both Citizens:
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

CORIOLANUS:
Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus. I am half through;
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
Here come more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
Indeed I would be consul.

Sixth Citizen:
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
man's voice.

Seventh Citizen:
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
and make him good friend to the people!

All Citizens:
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

CORIOLANUS:
Worthy voices!

MENENIUS:
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
That, in the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.

CORIOLANUS:
Is this done?

SICINIUS:
The custom of request you have discharged:
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the senate-house?

SICINIUS:
There, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
May I change these garments?

SICINIUS:
You may, sir.

CORIOLANUS:
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.

MENENIUS:
I'll keep you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people.

SICINIUS:
Fare you well.
He has it now, and by his looks methink
'Tis warm at 's heart.

BRUTUS:
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?

SICINIUS:
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

First Citizen:
He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS:
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Second Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citizen:
Certainly
He flouted us downright.

First Citizen:
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.

Second Citizen:
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS:
Why, so he did, I am sure.

Citizens:
No, no; no man saw 'em.

Third Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by your voices, will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
your voices,
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?

BRUTUS:
Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.

SICINIUS:
Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves, and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

Third Citizen:
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.

Second Citizen:
And will deny him:
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

First Citizen:
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.

BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties; make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS:
Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
The apprehension of his present portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS:
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS:
Say, you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS:
One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances: but you have found,
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.

BRUTUS:
Say, you ne'er had done't--
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol.

All:
We will so: almost all
Repent in their election.

BRUTUS:
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS:
To the Capitol, come:
We will be there before the stream o' the people;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.

CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LARTIUS:
He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
Our swifter composition.

CORIOLANUS:
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again.

COMINIUS:
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS:
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS:
On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS:
He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

LARTIUS:
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution, so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS:
At Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
For they do prank them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS:
Pass no further.

CORIOLANUS:
Ha! what is that?

BRUTUS:
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

CORIOLANUS:
What makes this change?

MENENIUS:
The matter?

COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children's voices?

First Senator:
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.

BRUTUS:
The people are incensed against him.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS:
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS:
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility:
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS:
Call't not a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS:
Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS:
How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS:
You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS:
Not unlike,
Each way, to better yours.

CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.

SICINIUS:
You show too much of that
For which the people stir: if you will pass
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke with him for tribune.

MENENIUS:
Let's be calm.

COMINIUS:
The people are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit.

CORIOLANUS:
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--

MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.

First Senator:
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons:
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given to beggars.

MENENIUS:
Well, no more.

First Senator:
No more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS:
You speak o' the people,
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS:
'Twere well
We let the people know't.

MENENIUS:
What, what? his choler?

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS:
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.

CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be senators: and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.

COMINIUS:
Well, on to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS:
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,--

MENENIUS:
Well, well, no more of that.

CORIOLANUS:
Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS:
Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS:
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS:
Come, enough.

BRUTUS:
Enough, with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
Has said enough.

SICINIUS:
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
As traitors do.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS:
This a consul? no.

BRUTUS:
The aediles, ho!
Let him be apprehended.

SICINIUS:
Go, call the people:
in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
And follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, old goat!

Senators, &C:
We'll surety him.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.

SICINIUS:
Help, ye citizens!

MENENIUS:
On both sides more respect.

SICINIUS:
Here's he that would take from you all your power.

BRUTUS:
Seize him, AEdiles!

Citizens:
Down with him! down with him!

Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENENIUS:
What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS:
Hear me, people; peace!

Citizens:
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.

SICINIUS:
You are at point to lose your liberties:
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have named for consul.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

First Senator:
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS:
What is the city but the people?

Citizens:
True,
The people are the city.

BRUTUS:
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.

Citizens:
You so remain.

MENENIUS:
And so are like to do.

COMINIUS:
That is the way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS:
This deserves death.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authority,
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of present death.

SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction cast him.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield!

MENENIUS:
Hear me one word;
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.

AEdile:
Peace, peace!

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Sir, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
And bear him to the rock.

CORIOLANUS:
No, I'll die here.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

MENENIUS:
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS:
Lay hands upon him.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old!

Citizens:
Down with him, down with him!

MENENIUS:
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.

Second Senator:
Get you gone.

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We have as many friends as enemies.

MENENIUS:
Sham it be put to that?

First Senator:
The gods forbid!
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
Leave us to cure this cause.

MENENIUS:
For 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.

COMINIUS:
Come, sir, along with us.

CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--

MENENIUS:
Be gone;
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
One time will owe another.

CORIOLANUS:
On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes:
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are used to bear.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, be gone:
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
With cloth of any colour.

COMINIUS:
Nay, come away.

A Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortune.

MENENIUS:
His nature is too noble for the world:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He heard the name of death.
Here's goodly work!

Second Patrician:
I would they were abed!

MENENIUS:
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
Could he not speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?

MENENIUS:
You worthy tribunes,--

SICINIUS:
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power
Which he so sets at nought.

First Citizen:
He shall well know
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
And we their hands.

Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.

MENENIUS:
Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
Peace!

MENENIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
With modest warrant.

SICINIUS:
Sir, how comes't that you
Have holp to make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
Hear me speak:
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Consul! what consul?

MENENIUS:
The consul Coriolanus.

BRUTUS:
He consul!

Citizens:
No, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS:
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time.

SICINIUS:
Speak briefly then;
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
He dies to-night.

MENENIUS:
Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS:
He's a disease that must be cut away.

MENENIUS:
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country,
Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
A brand to the end o' the world.

SICINIUS:
This is clean kam.

BRUTUS:
Merely awry: when he did love his country,
It honour'd him.

MENENIUS:
The service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.

MENENIUS:
One word more, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS:
If it were so,--

SICINIUS:
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.

MENENIUS:
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
In bolted language; meal and bran together
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.

First Senator:
Noble tribunes,
It is the humane way: the other course
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning.

SICINIUS:
Noble Menenius,
Be you then as the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons.

BRUTUS:
Go not home.

SICINIUS:
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
In our first way.

MENENIUS:
I'll bring him to you.
Let me desire your company: he must come,
Or what is worst will follow.

First Senator:
Pray you, let's to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them.

A Patrician:
You do the nobler.

CORIOLANUS:
I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war.
I talk of you:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
False to my nature? Rather say I play
The man I am.

VOLUMNIA:
O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put your power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

CORIOLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
You might have been enough the man you are,
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispositions, if
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them hang.

A Patrician:
Ay, and burn too.

MENENIUS:
Come, come, you have been too rough, something
too rough;
You must return and mend it.

First Senator:
There's no remedy;
Unless, by not so doing, our good city
Cleave in the midst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.

MENENIUS:
Well said, noble woman?
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I do?

MENENIUS:
Return to the tribunes.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, what then? what then?

MENENIUS:
Repent what you have spoke.

CORIOLANUS:
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute;
Though therein you can never be too noble,
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
In peace what each of them by the other lose,
That they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush!

MENENIUS:
A good demand.

VOLUMNIA:
If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour, as in war, since that to both
It stands in like request?

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA:
Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people; not by your own instruction,
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but rooted in
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour: I am in this,
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you will rather show our general louts
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin.

MENENIUS:
Noble lady!
Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
Of what is past.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thou hast power and person.

MENENIUS:
This but done,
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
As words to little purpose.

VOLUMNIA:
Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make strong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
Only fair speech.

COMINIUS:
I think 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA:
He must, and will
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

CORIOLANUS:
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life.

COMINIUS:
Come, come, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
To have my praise for this, perform a part
Thou hast not done before.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, I must do't:
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.

VOLUMNIA:
At thy choice, then:
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy pride thyself.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be content:
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' the way of flattery further.

VOLUMNIA:
Do your will.

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will answer in mine honour.

MENENIUS:
Ay, but mildly.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

BRUTUS:
In this point charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
Was ne'er distributed.
What, will he come?

AEdile:
He's coming.

BRUTUS:
How accompanied?

AEdile:
With old Menenius, and those senators
That always favour'd him.

SICINIUS:
Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll?

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS:
Have you collected them by tribes?

AEdile:
I have.

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently the people hither;
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' the truth o' the cause.

AEdile:
I shall inform them.

BRUTUS:
And when such time they have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence.

AEdile:
Very well.

SICINIUS:
Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS:
Go about it.
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck.

SICINIUS:
Well, here he comes.

MENENIUS:
Calmly, I do beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war!

First Senator:
Amen, amen.

MENENIUS:
A noble wish.

SICINIUS:
Draw near, ye people.

AEdile:
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!

CORIOLANUS:
First, hear me speak.

Both Tribunes:
Well, say. Peace, ho!

CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?

SICINIUS:
I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices,
Allow their officers and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
As shall be proved upon you?

CORIOLANUS:
I am content.

MENENIUS:
Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
The warlike service he has done, consider; think
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.

MENENIUS:
Consider further,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
Rather than envy you.

COMINIUS:
Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS:
What is the matter
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
You take it off again?

SICINIUS:
Answer to us.

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

SICINIUS:
We charge you, that you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
How! traitor!

MENENIUS:
Nay, temperately; your promise.

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods.

SICINIUS:
Mark you this, people?

Citizens:
To the rock, to the rock with him!

SICINIUS:
Peace!
We need not put new matter to his charge:
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
Those whose great power must try him; even this,
So criminal and in such capital kind,
Deserves the extremest death.

BRUTUS:
But since he hath
Served well for Rome,--

CORIOLANUS:
What do you prate of service?

BRUTUS:
I talk of that, that know it.

CORIOLANUS:
You?

MENENIUS:
Is this the promise that you made your mother?

COMINIUS:
Know, I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS:
I know no further:
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
For that he has,
As much as in him lies, from time to time
Envied against the people, seeking means
To pluck away their power, as now at last
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
Even from this instant, banish him our city,
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
I say it shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS:
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--

SICINIUS:
He's sentenced; no more hearing.

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I have been consul, and can show for Rome
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
My country's good with a respect more tender,
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
We know your drift: speak what?

BRUTUS:
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country:
It shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so.

CORIOLANUS:
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair! Have the power still
To banish your defenders; till at length
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows! Despising,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
There is a world elsewhere.

AEdile:
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

SICINIUS:
Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
As he hath followed you, with all despite;
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through the city.

Citizens:
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

CORIOLANUS:
Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage? you were used
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
That common chances common men could bear;
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA:
O heavens! O heavens!

CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
And occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS:
What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
My hazards still have been your solace: and
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
Will or exceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise.

VOLUMNIA:
My first son.
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine on some course,
More than a wild exposture to each chance
That starts i' the way before thee.

CORIOLANUS:
O the gods!

COMINIUS:
I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
I' the absence of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye well:
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
While I remain above the ground, you shall
Hear from me still, and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS:
That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
If I could shake off but one seven years
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
I'ld with thee every foot.

CORIOLANUS:
Give me thy hand: Come.

SICINIUS:
Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.

BRUTUS:
Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Than when it was a-doing.

SICINIUS:
Bid them home:
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Stand in their ancient strength.

BRUTUS:
Dismiss them home.
Here comes his mother.

SICINIUS:
Let's not meet her.

BRUTUS:
Why?

SICINIUS:
They say she's mad.

BRUTUS:
They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.

VOLUMNIA:
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!

MENENIUS:
Peace, peace; be not so loud.

VOLUMNIA:
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
Nay, and you shall hear some.
Will you be gone?

VIRGILIA:

SICINIUS:
Are you mankind?

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
His good sword in his hand.

SICINIUS:
What then?

VIRGILIA:
What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.

VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

MENENIUS:
Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS:
I would he had continued to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The noble knot he made.

BRUTUS:
I would he had.

VOLUMNIA:
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

BRUTUS:
Well, well, we'll leave you.

SICINIUS:
Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits?

VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayers with you.
I would the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
Of what lies heavy to't.

MENENIUS:
You have told them home;
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA:
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!

Roman:
I know you well, sir, and you know
me: your name, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.

Roman:
I am a Roman; and my services are,
as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?

Volsce:
Nicanor? no.

Roman:
The same, sir.

Volsce:
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
to find you out there: you have well saved me a
day's journey.

Roman:
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.

Volsce:
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.

Roman:
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people and to pluck from them
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
breaking out.

Volsce:
Coriolanus banished!

Roman:
Banished, sir.

Volsce:
You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman:
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
of his country.

Volsce:
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
business, and I will merrily accompany you home.

Roman:
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

Volsce:
A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

Roman:
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.

Volsce:
You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
to be glad of yours.

Roman:
Well, let us go together.

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me.
Save you, sir.

Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
At his house this night.

CORIOLANUS:
Which is his house, beseech you?

Citizen:
This, here before you.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir: farewell.
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
On a dissension of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
To take the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
I'll do his country service.

First Servingman:
Wine, wine, wine! What service
is here! I think our fellows are asleep.

Second Servingman:
Where's Cotus? my master calls
for him. Cotus!

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.

First Servingman:
What would you have, friend? whence are you?
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.

CORIOLANUS:
I have deserved no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.

Second Servingman:
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
Pray, get you out.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

Second Servingman:
Away! get you away.

CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome.

Second Servingman:
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.

Third Servingman:
What fellow's this?

First Servingman:
A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.

Third Servingman:
What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
the house.

CORIOLANUS:
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.

Third Servingman:
What are you?

CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman.

Third Servingman:
A marvellous poor one.

CORIOLANUS:
True, so I am.

Third Servingman:
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS:
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.

Third Servingman:
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange guest he has here.

Second Servingman:
And I shall.

Third Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS:
Under the canopy.

Third Servingman:
Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

Third Servingman:
Where's that?

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city of kites and crows.

Third Servingman:
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS:
No, I serve not thy master.

Third Servingman:
How, sir! do you meddle with my master?

CORIOLANUS:
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!

AUFIDIUS:
Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman:
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords within.

AUFIDIUS:
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
If, Tullus,
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS:
What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS:
Say, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
I know thee not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straight,
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS:
O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepared against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS:
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges, take
The one half of my commission; and set down--
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

First Servingman:
Here's a strange alteration!

Second Servingman:
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him.

First Servingman:
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

Second Servingman:
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
cannot tell how to term it.

First Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.

Second Servingman:
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
man i' the world.

First Servingman:
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.

Second Servingman:
Who, my master?

First Servingman:
Nay, it's no matter for that.

Second Servingman:
Worth six on him.

First Servingman:
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.

Second Servingman:
Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.

First Servingman:
Ay, and for an assault too.

Third Servingman:
O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Servingman:
What, what, what? let's partake.

Third Servingman:
I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
lieve be a condemned man.

First Servingman:
Wherefore? wherefore?

Third Servingman:
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
Caius Marcius.

First Servingman:
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?

Third Servingman:
I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
good enough for him.

Second Servingman:
Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.

First Servingman:
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado.

Second Servingman:
An he had been cannibally given, he might have
broiled and eaten him too.

First Servingman:
But, more of thy news?

Third Servingman:
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
question asked him by any of the senators, but they
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.

Second Servingman:
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

Third Servingman:
Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman:
Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman:
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
and the man in blood, they will out of their
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
him.

First Servingman:
But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman:
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips.

Second Servingman:
Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.

First Servingman:
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.

Second Servingman:
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds.

First Servingman:
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

Third Servingman:
Reason; because they then less need one another.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.

All:
In, in, in, in!

SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.

BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time.
Is this Menenius?

SICINIUS:
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.

Both Tribunes:
Hail sir!

MENENIUS:
Hail to you both!

SICINIUS:
Your Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS:
All's well; and might have been much better, if
He could have temporized.

SICINIUS:
Where is he, hear you?

MENENIUS:
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him.

Citizens:
The gods preserve you both!

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS:
God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

First Citizen:
Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
Are bound to pray for you both.

SICINIUS:
Live, and thrive!

BRUTUS:
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.

Citizens:
Now the gods keep you!

Both Tribunes:
Farewell, farewell.

SICINIUS:
This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
Crying confusion.

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,--

SICINIUS:
And affecting one sole throne,
Without assistance.

MENENIUS:
I think not so.

SICINIUS:
We should by this, to all our lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUS:
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and still without him.

AEdile:
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS:
Come, what talk you
Of Marcius?

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS:
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
And three examples of the like have been
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS:
Tell not me:
I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.

Messenger:
The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their countenances.

SICINIUS:
'Tis this slave;--
Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
Nothing but his report.

Messenger:
Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.

SICINIUS:
What more fearful?

Messenger:
It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS:
This is most likely!

BRUTUS:
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.

SICINIUS:
The very trick on't.

MENENIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Second Messenger:
You are sent for to the senate:
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our territories; and have already
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
What lay before them.

COMINIUS:
O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS:
What news? what news?

COMINIUS:
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--

MENENIUS:
What's the news? what's the news?

COMINIUS:
Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an auger's bore.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, your news?
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than nature,
That shapes man better; and they follow him,
Against us brats, with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS:
You have made good work,
You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS:
He will shake
Your Rome about your ears.

MENENIUS:
As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!

BRUTUS:
But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find something in him.

MENENIUS:
We are all undone, unless
The noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS:
Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
And therein show'd like enemies.

MENENIUS:
'Tis true:
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it, I have not the face
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!

COMINIUS:
You have brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
So incapable of help.

Both Tribunes:
Say not we brought it.

MENENIUS:
How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
Who did hoot him out o' the city.

COMINIUS:
But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
That Rome can make against them.

MENENIUS:
Here come the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
if he could burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved it.

Citizens:
Faith, we hear fearful news.

First Citizen:
For mine own part,
When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.

Second Citizen:
And so did I.

Third Citizen:
And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
it was against our will.

COMINIUS:
Ye re goodly things, you voices!

MENENIUS:
You have made
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?

COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else?

SICINIUS:
Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign of fear.

First Citizen:
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
him.

Second Citizen:
So did we all. But, come, let's home.

BRUTUS:
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS:
Nor I.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!

SICINIUS:
Pray, let us go.

AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to the Roman?

Lieutenant:
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
Even by your own.

AUFIDIUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
Yet I wish, sir,--
I mean for your particular,--you had not
Join'd in commission with him; but either
Had borne the action of yourself, or else
To him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
when he shall come to his account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er we come to our account.

Lieutenant:
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS:
All places yield to him ere he sits down;
And the nobility of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
Which was sometime his general; who loved him
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS:
He would not seem to know me.

MENENIUS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
Yet one time he did call me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we have bled together. Coriolanus
He would not answer to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Of burning Rome.

MENENIUS:
Why, so: you have made good work!
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected: he replied,
It was a bare petition of a state
To one whom they had punish'd.

MENENIUS:
Very well:
Could he say less?

COMINIUS:
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
And still to nose the offence.

MENENIUS:
For one poor grain or two!
I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS:
Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
More than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not meddle.

SICINIUS:
Pray you, go to him.

MENENIUS:
What should I do?

BRUTUS:
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

MENENIUS:
Well, and say that Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Unheard; what then?
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS:
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
As you intended well.

MENENIUS:
I'll undertake 't:
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was not taken well; he had not dined:
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
These and these conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
Till he be dieted to my request,
And then I'll set upon him.

BRUTUS:
You know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot lose your way.

MENENIUS:
Good faith, I'll prove him,
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success.

COMINIUS:
He'll never hear him.

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
So that all hope is vain.
Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

First Senator:
Stay: whence are you?

Second Senator:
Stand, and go back.

MENENIUS:
You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
I am an officer of state, and come
To speak with Coriolanus.

First Senator:
From whence?

MENENIUS:
From Rome.

First Senator:
You may not pass, you must return: our general
Will no more hear from thence.

Second Senator:
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.

MENENIUS:
Good my friends,
If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.

First Senator:
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Is not here passable.

MENENIUS:
I tell thee, fellow,
The general is my lover: I have been
The book of his good acts, whence men have read
His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have ever verified my friends,
Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
I must have leave to pass.

First Senator:
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
always factionary on the party of your general.

Second Senator:
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
speak with him till after dinner.

First Senator:
You are a Roman, are you?

MENENIUS:
I am, as thy general is.

First Senator:
Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
when you have pushed out your gates the very
defender of them, and, in a violent popular
ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
you out of reprieve and pardon.

MENENIUS:
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
use me with estimation.

Second Senator:
Come, my captain knows you not.

MENENIUS:
I mean, thy general.

First Senator:
My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
the utmost of your having: back.

MENENIUS:
Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--

CORIOLANUS:
What's the matter?

MENENIUS:
Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
hanging, or of some death more long in
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
thee; but being assured none but myself could move
thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
access to thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

MENENIUS:
How! away!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My revenge properly, my remission lies
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS:
You keep a constant temper.

First Senator:
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Second Senator:
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
way home again.

First Senator:
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back?

Second Senator:
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
I neither care for the world nor your general: for
such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
himself fears it not from another: let your general
do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
as I was said to, Away!

First Senator:
A noble fellow, I warrant him.

Second Senator:
The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
oak not to be wind-shaken.

CORIOLANUS:
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
I have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS:
Only their ends
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
That thought them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Loved me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
The first conditions, which they did refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
As if a man were author of himself
And knew no other kin.

VIRGILIA:
My lord and husband!

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA:
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think so.

CORIOLANUS:
Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
I kneel before thee; and unproperly
Show duty, as mistaken all this while
Between the child and parent.

CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot be, slight work.

VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

CORIOLANUS:
The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

VOLUMNIA:
This is a poor epitome of yours,
Which by the interpretation of full time
May show like all yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
The god of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And saving those that eye thee!

VOLUMNIA:
Your knee, sirrah.

CORIOLANUS:
That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Are suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS:
I beseech you, peace:
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To ally my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not grant us any thing;
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

CORIOLANUS:
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA:
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
which should
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
with comforts,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
Making the mother, wife and child to see
The son, the husband and the father tearing
His country's bowels out. And to poor we
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
Alas, how can we for our country pray.
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
Our comfort in the country. We must find
An evident calamity, though we had
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
With manacles thorough our streets, or else
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country than to tread--
Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
That brought thee to this world.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
Living to time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' shall not tread on me;
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.

CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat too long.

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
'This we received;' and each in either side
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
To imitate the graces of the gods;
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
And then I'll speak a little.

CORIOLANUS:
O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS:
I was moved withal.

CORIOLANUS:
I dare be sworn you were:
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, by and by;
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A better witness back than words, which we,
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you: all the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
Could not have made this peace.

MENENIUS:
See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
corner-stone?

SICINIUS:
Why, what of that?

MENENIUS:
If it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution.

SICINIUS:
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man!

MENENIUS:
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
He loved his mother dearly.

MENENIUS:
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.

MENENIUS:
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
you.

SICINIUS:
The gods be good unto us!

MENENIUS:
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
They'll give him death by inches.

SICINIUS:
What's the news?

Second Messenger:
Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS:
Friend,
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?

Second Messenger:
As certain as I know the sun is fire:
Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
Make the sun dance. Hark you!

MENENIUS:
This is good news:
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!

SICINIUS:
First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulness.

Second Messenger:
Sir, we have all
Great cause to give great thanks.

SICINIUS:
They are near the city?

Second Messenger:
Almost at point to enter.

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help the joy.

First Senator:
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'

All:
Welcome, ladies, Welcome!

AUFIDIUS:
Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before the people, hoping
To purge herself with words: dispatch.
Most welcome!

First Conspirator:
How is it with our general?

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
And with his charity slain.

Second Conspirator:
Most noble sir,
If you do hold the same intent wherein
You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
Of your great danger.

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people.

Third Conspirator:
The people will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS:
I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
He bow'd his nature, never known before
But to be rough, unswayable and free.

Third Conspirator:
Sir, his stoutness
When he did stand for consul, which he lost
By lack of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS:
That I would have spoke of:
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his designments
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with his countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

First Conspirator:
So he did, my lord:
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS:
There was it:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

First Conspirator:
Your native town you enter'd like a post,
And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
Splitting the air with noise.

Second Conspirator:
And patient fools,
Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
With giving him glory.

Third Conspirator:
Therefore, at your vantage,
Ere he express himself, or move the people
With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
Which we will second. When he lies along,
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
His reasons with his body.

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here come the lords.

All The Lords:
You are most welcome home.

AUFIDIUS:
I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
What I have written to you?

Lords:
We have.

First Lord:
And grieve to hear't.
What faults he made before the last, I think
Might have found easy fines: but there to end
Where he was to begin and give away
The benefit of our levies, answering us
With our own charge, making a treaty where
There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS:
He approaches: you shall hear him.

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Under your great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action. We have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
We have compounded on.

AUFIDIUS:
Read it not, noble lords;
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath abused your powers.

CORIOLANUS:
Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
He has betray'd your business, and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
Look'd wondering each at other.

CORIOLANUS:
Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUFIDIUS:
No more.

CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

First Lord:
Peace, both, and hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it. Boy!

AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble lords,
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your own eyes and ears?

All Conspirators:
Let him die for't.

All The People:
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'

Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
And trouble not the peace.

CORIOLANUS:
O that I had him,
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
To use my lawful sword!

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS:
My noble masters, hear me speak.

First Lord:
O Tullus,--

Second Lord:
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.

Third Lord:
Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
Put up your swords.

AUFIDIUS:
My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.

First Lord:
Bear from hence his body;
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
As the most noble corse that ever herald
Did follow to his urn.

Second Lord:
His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of it.

AUFIDIUS:
My rage is gone;
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Clarence comes.
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
That waits upon your grace?

CLARENCE:
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?

CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.

GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE:
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be;
And, for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Have moved his highness to commit me now.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?

GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
If we will keep in favour with the king,
To be her men and wear her livery:
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with his brother.

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
You may partake of any thing we say:
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?

BRAKENBURY:
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.

GLOUCESTER:
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

BRAKENBURY:
What one, my lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.

CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

GLOUCESTER:
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

CLARENCE:
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
Meantime, have patience.

CLARENCE:
I must perforce. Farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?

HASTINGS:
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!

GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?

HASTINGS:
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
That were the cause of my imprisonment.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
For they that were your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.

HASTINGS:
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
What news abroad?

HASTINGS:
No news so bad abroad as this at home;
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
And his physicians fear him mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
And overmuch consumed his royal person:
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
What, is he in his bed?

HASTINGS:
He is.

GLOUCESTER:
Go you before, and I will follow you.
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live:
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I; not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent,
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run before my horse to market:
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

LADY ANNE:
Set down, set down your honourable load,
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
If ever he have wife, let her he made
A miserable by the death of him
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.

GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

LADY ANNE:
What black magician conjures up this fiend,
To stop devoted charitable deeds?

GLOUCESTER:
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

Gentleman:
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.

GLOUCESTER:
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.

LADY ANNE:
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

LADY ANNE:
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
Either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

LADY ANNE:
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

GLOUCESTER:
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

LADY ANNE:
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
For these known evils, but to give me leave,
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCESTER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LADY ANNE:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew them not?

LADY ANNE:
Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.

GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then he is alive.

GLOUCESTER:
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

LADY ANNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.

GLOUCESTER:
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.

LADY ANNE:
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
Didst thou not kill this king?

GLOUCESTER:
I grant ye.

LADY ANNE:
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!

GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.

LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
For he was fitter for that place than earth.

LADY ANNE:
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

LADY ANNE:
Some dungeon.

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

LADY ANNE:
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

GLOUCESTER:
So will it, madam till I lie with you.

LADY ANNE:
I hope so.

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?

LADY ANNE:
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

GLOUCESTER:
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world,
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

LADY ANNE:
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

GLOUCESTER:
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
So I by that; it is my day, my life.

LADY ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.

LADY ANNE:
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.

GLOUCESTER:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be revenged on him that loveth you.

LADY ANNE:
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.

GLOUCESTER:
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Did it to help thee to a better husband.

LADY ANNE:
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

GLOUCESTER:
He lives that loves thee better than he could.

LADY ANNE:
Name him.

GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE:
Why, that was he.

GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.

LADY ANNE:
Where is he?

GLOUCESTER:
Here.
Why dost thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

GLOUCESTER:
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE:
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTER:
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

LADY ANNE:
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!

GLOUCESTER:
I would they were, that I might die at once;
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father's death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
Take up the sword again, or take up me.

LADY ANNE:
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
I will not be the executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

LADY ANNE:
I have already.

GLOUCESTER:
Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.

LADY ANNE:
I would I knew thy heart.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in my tongue.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me both are false.

GLOUCESTER:
Then never man was true.

LADY ANNE:
Well, well, put up your sword.

GLOUCESTER:
Say, then, my peace is made.

LADY ANNE:
That shall you know hereafter.

GLOUCESTER:
But shall I live in hope?

LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER:
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

LADY ANNE:
To take is not to give.

GLOUCESTER:
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

LADY ANNE:
What is it?

GLOUCESTER:
That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
Grant me this boon.

LADY ANNE:
With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.

GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell.

LADY ANNE:
'Tis more than you deserve;
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have said farewell already.

GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, take up the corse.

GENTLEMEN:
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

GLOUCESTER:
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
against me,
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while:
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
To study fashions to adorn my body:
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
Will maintain it with some little cost.
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

RIVERS:
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

GREY:
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If he were dead, what would betide of me?

RIVERS:
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.

GREY:
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
To be your comforter when he is gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

RIVERS:
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determined, not concluded yet:
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.

GREY:
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto your royal grace!

DERBY:
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

DERBY:
I do beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.

RIVERS:
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would all were well! but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest.

GLOUCESTER:
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
Who are they that complain unto the king,
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

RIVERS:
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?

GLOUCESTER:
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in your outward actions shows itself
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends':
God grant we never may have need of you!

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him that raised me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

RIVERS:
She may, my lord, for--

GLOUCESTER:
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may help you to many fair preferments,
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on your high deserts.
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--

RIVERS:
What, marry, may she?

GLOUCESTER:
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grandam had a worser match.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this condition,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Small joy have I in being England's queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

GLOUCESTER:
What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Out, devil! I remember them too well:
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.

GLOUCESTER:
In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.

GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN MARGARET:
Which God revenge!

GLOUCESTER:
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.

RIVERS:
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
So should we you, if you should be our king.

GLOUCESTER:
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, do not turn away!

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That will I make before I let thee go.

GLOUCESTER:
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER:
The curse my noble father laid on thee,
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So just is God, to right the innocent.

HASTINGS:
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!

RIVERS:
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.

DORSET:
No man but prophesied revenge for it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What were you snarling all before I came,
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
That none of you may live your natural age,
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!

GLOUCESTER:
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--

GLOUCESTER:
Margaret.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
Ha!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER:
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.

RIVERS:
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.

QUEEN MARGARET:
To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!

DORSET:
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
O, that your young nobility could judge
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.

GLOUCESTER:
Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, if not for charity.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
My charity is outrage, life my shame
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, have done.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
In sign of league and amity with thee:
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on him.

GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day,
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!

HASTINGS:
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

RIVERS:
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did her any, to my knowledge.

GLOUCESTER:
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the cause of it!

RIVERS:
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

GLOUCESTER:
So do I ever:
being well-advised.
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.

CATESBY:
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?

RIVERS:
Madam, we will attend your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
But, soft! here come my executioners.
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?

First Murderer:
We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
That we may be admitted where he is.

GLOUCESTER:
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

First Murderer:
Tush!
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
Talkers are no good doers: be assured
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.

GLOUCESTER:
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
I like you, lads; about your business straight;
Go, go, dispatch.

First Murderer:
We will, my noble lord.

BRAKENBURY:
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

CLARENCE:
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!

BRAKENBURY:
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.

BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?

CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you not with this sore agony?

CLARENCE:
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling waked, and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made the dream.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
Princes have but their tides for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They often feel a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

First Murderer:
Ho! who's here?

BRAKENBURY:
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?

First Murderer:
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY:
Yea, are you so brief?

Second Murderer:
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
him our commission; talk no more.

BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
I'll to the king; and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

First Murderer:
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.

Second Murderer:
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?

First Murderer:
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.

Second Murderer:
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
the judgment-day.

First Murderer:
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.

Second Murderer:
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.

First Murderer:
What, art thou afraid?

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.

First Murderer:
I thought thou hadst been resolute.

Second Murderer:
So I am, to let him live.

First Murderer:
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.

Second Murderer:
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.

First Murderer:
How dost thou feel thyself now?

Second Murderer:
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me.

First Murderer:
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.

First Murderer:
Where is thy conscience now?

Second Murderer:
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.

First Murderer:
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
thy conscience flies out.

Second Murderer:
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.

First Murderer:
How if it come to thee again?

Second Murderer:
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it.

First Murderer:
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
not to kill the duke.

Second Murderer:
Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.

First Murderer:
Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
I warrant thee.

Second Murderer:
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?

First Murderer:
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
in the next room.

Second Murderer:
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.

First Murderer:
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with him.

CLARENCE:
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

Second murderer:
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.

CLARENCE:
In God's name, what art thou?

Second Murderer:
A man, as you are.

CLARENCE:
But not, as I am, royal.

Second Murderer:
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

Second Murderer:
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.

CLARENCE:
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

Both:
To, to, to--

CLARENCE:
To murder me?

Both:
Ay, ay.

CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

First Murderer:
Offended us you have not, but the king.

CLARENCE:
I shall be reconciled to him again.

Second Murderer:
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.

CLARENCE:
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake is damnable.

First Murderer:
What we will do, we do upon command.

Second Murderer:
And he that hath commanded is the king.

CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.

Second Murderer:
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For false forswearing and for murder too:
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.

First Murderer:
And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.

Second Murderer:
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First Murderer:
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?

CLARENCE:
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me for this
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged for this deed.
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.

First Murderer:
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?

CLARENCE:
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

First Murderer:
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

Second Murderer:
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.

CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

Both:
Ay, so we will.

CLARENCE:
Tell him, when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

First Murderer:
Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.

CLARENCE:
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.

First Murderer:
Right,
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would labour my delivery.

Second Murderer:
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.

First Murderer:
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

CLARENCE:
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.

Second Murderer:
What shall we do?

CLARENCE:
Relent, and save your souls.

First Murderer:
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

CLARENCE:
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
As you would beg, were you in my distress
A begging prince what beggar pities not?

Second Murderer:
Look behind you, my lord.

First Murderer:
Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

Second Murderer:
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!

First Murderer:
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!

Second Murderer:
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
For I repent me that the duke is slain.

First Murderer:
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
Now must I hide his body in some hole,
Until the duke take order for his burial:
And when I have my meed, I must away;
For this will out, and here I must not stay.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
You peers, continue this united league:
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.

RIVERS:
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.

HASTINGS:
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!

KING EDWARD IV:
Take heed you dally not before your king;
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you to be the other's end.

HASTINGS:
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!

RIVERS:
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factious one against the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

KING EDWARD IV:
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.

DORSET:
This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be unviolable.

HASTINGS:
And so swear I, my lord

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
And make me happy in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM:
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours,
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in zeal to yours.

KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
To make the perfect period of this peace.

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.

GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

KING EDWARD IV:
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
Brother, we done deeds of charity;
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe;
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
By any in this presence, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
That without desert have frown'd on me;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born to-night
I thank my God for my humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
To be so bouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

RIVERS:
Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!

BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

DORSET:
Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.

GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear:
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
That came too lag to see him buried.
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
And yet go current from suspicion!

DORSET:
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.

DORSET:
I will not rise, unless your highness grant.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.

DORSET:
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was cruel death.
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
And I unjustly too, must grant it you
But for my brother not a man would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
To comfort Edward with our company.

BUCKINGHAM:
We wait upon your grace.

Boy:
Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.

Boy:
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'

Girl:
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
If that our noble father be alive?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
I do lament the sickness of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

Boy:
Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
The king my uncle is to blame for this:
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With daily prayers all to that effect.

Girl:
And so will I.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.

Boy:
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
Devised impeachments to imprison him :
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly as his child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

Boy:
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ay, boy.

Boy:
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my soul,
And to myself become an enemy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What means this scene of rude impatience?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make an act of tragic violence:
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
And lived by looking on his images:
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

Boy:
Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?

Girl:
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

Children:
Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.

Children:
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Was never widow had so dear a loss!

Children:
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentations.

DORSET:
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.

GLOUCESTER:
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's love
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

RIVERS:
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
Which would be so much the more dangerous
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
And may direct his course as please himself,
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER:
I hope the king made peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and true in me.

RIVERS:
And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which haply by much company might be urged:
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

HASTINGS:
And so say I.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be it so; and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
To give your censures in this weighty business?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
With all our harts.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.

GLOUCESTER:
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

First Citizen:
Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?

Second Citizen:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
Hear you the news abroad?

First Citizen:
Ay, that the king is dead.

Second Citizen:
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.

Third Citizen:
Neighbours, God speed!

First Citizen:
Give you good morrow, sir.

Third Citizen:
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?

Second Citizen:
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!

Third Citizen:
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.

First Citizen:
No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.

Third Citizen:
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!

Second Citizen:
In him there is a hope of government,
That in his nonage council under him,
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.

First Citizen:
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.

Third Citizen:
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
For then this land was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.

First Citizen:
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.

Third Citizen:
Better it were they all came by the father,
Or by the father there were none at all;
For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
This sickly land might solace as before.

First Citizen:
Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.

Third Citizen:
When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.

Second Citizen:
Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of fear.

Third Citizen:
Before the times of change, still is it so:
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
But leave it all to God. whither away?

Second Citizen:
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.

Third Citizen:
And so was I: I'll bear you company.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

YORK:
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

YORK:
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.

YORK:
Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

YORK:
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?

YORK:
Grandam, his nurse.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.

YORK:
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Good madam, be not angry with the child.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Pitchers have ears.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Here comes a messenger. What news?

Messenger:
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares the prince?

Messenger:
Well, madam, and in health.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is thy news then?

Messenger:
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who hath committed them?

Messenger:
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For what offence?

Messenger:
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
Why or for what these nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end of all.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, to look on death no more!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You have no cause.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
My gracious lady, go;
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

PRINCE EDWARD:
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
God keep me from false friends! but they were none.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace with health and happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
I thought my mother, and my brother York,
Would long ere this have met us on the way
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
To tell us whether they will come or no!

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?

HASTINGS:
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
The queen your mother, and your brother York,
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
But by his mother was perforce withheld.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

CARDINAL:
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

BUCKINGHAM:
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
And those who have the wit to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
You break no privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.

CARDINAL:
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?

HASTINGS:
I go, my lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Is it upon record, or else reported
Successively from age to age, he built it?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon record, my gracious lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
Even to the general all-ending day.

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
What say you, uncle?

GLOUCESTER:
I say, without characters, fame lives long.
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.

PRINCE EDWARD:
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
His wit set down to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--

BUCKINGHAM:
What, my gracious lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if I live until I be a man,
I'll win our ancient right in France again,
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?

YORK:
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
Too late he died that might have kept that title,
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?

YORK:
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTER:
He hath, my lord.

YORK:
And therefore is he idle?

GLOUCESTER:
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.

YORK:
Then is he more beholding to you than I.

GLOUCESTER:
He may command me as my sovereign;
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.

YORK:
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER:
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.

PRINCE EDWARD:
A beggar, brother?

YORK:
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.

GLOUCESTER:
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.

YORK:
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.

GLOUCESTER:
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.

YORK:
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.

GLOUCESTER:
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

YORK:
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

YORK:
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

GLOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.

YORK:
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
Because that I am little, like an ape,
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, will't please you pass along?
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

YORK:
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
My lord protector needs will have it so.

YORK:
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what should you fear?

YORK:
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
My grandam told me he was murdered there.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Nor none that live, I hope.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
Think you, my lord, this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart:
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
For the instalment of this noble duke
In the seat royal of this famous isle?

CATESBY:
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
That he will not be won to aught against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?

CATESBY:
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
To sit about the coronation.
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination:
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.

CATESBY:
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.

GLOUCESTER:
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

CATESBY:
You shall, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

GLOUCESTER:
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.

GLOUCESTER:
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form.

Messenger:
What, ho! my lord!

HASTINGS:

Messenger:
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.

HASTINGS:
What is't o'clock?

Messenger:
Upon the stroke of four.

HASTINGS:
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?

Messenger:
So it should seem by that I have to say.
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.

HASTINGS:
And then?

Messenger:
And then he sends you word
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
Besides, he says there are two councils held;
And that may be determined at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other.
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
If presently you will take horse with him,
And with all speed post with him toward the north,
To shun the danger that his soul divines.

HASTINGS:
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
Bid him not fear the separated councils
His honour and myself are at the one,
And at the other is my servant Catesby
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
And we will both together to the Tower,
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.

Messenger:
My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.

CATESBY:
Many good morrows to my noble lord!

HASTINGS:
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
And I believe twill never stand upright
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.

HASTINGS:
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?

CATESBY:
Ay, my good lord.

HASTINGS:
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
That this same very day your enemies,
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

HASTINGS:
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
Because they have been still mine enemies:
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
God knows I will not do it, to the death.

CATESBY:
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!

HASTINGS:
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
That they who brought me in my master's hate
I live to look upon their tragedy.
I tell thee, Catesby--

CATESBY:
What, my lord?

HASTINGS:
Ere a fortnight make me elder,
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.

CATESBY:
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unprepared and look not for it.

HASTINGS:
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
With some men else, who think themselves as safe
As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.

CATESBY:
The princes both make high account of you;
For they account his head upon the bridge.

HASTINGS:
I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?

STANLEY:
My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
I do not like these several councils, I.

HASTINGS:
My lord,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And never in my life, I do protest,
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
Think you, but that I know our state secure,
I would be so triumphant as I am?

STANLEY:
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.

HASTINGS:
Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.

LORD STANLEY:
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
But come, my lord, let us away.

HASTINGS:
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?

Pursuivant:
The better that your lordship please to ask.

HASTINGS:
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
This day those enemies are put to death,
And I in better state than e'er I was.

Pursuivant:
God hold it, to your honour's good content!

HASTINGS:
Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.

Pursuivant:
God save your lordship!

Priest:
Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.

HASTINGS:
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
I am in your debt for your last exercise;
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.

HASTINGS:
Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
Those men you talk of came into my mind.
What, go you toward the Tower?

BUCKINGHAM:
I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
I shall return before your lordship thence.

HASTINGS:
'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.

BUCKINGHAM:

HASTINGS:
I'll wait upon your lordship.

RATCLIFF:
Come, bring forth the prisoners.

RIVERS:
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

GREY:
God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!

VAUGHAN:
You live that shall cry woe for this after.

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.

RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.

GREY:
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

RIVERS:
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
And for my sister and her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

RATCLIFF:
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.

HASTINGS:
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
Is, to determine of the coronation.
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?

BUCKINGHAM:
Are all things fitting for that royal time?

DERBY:
It is, and wants but nomination.

BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Who is most inward with the royal duke?

BISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

HASTINGS:
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
But, for his purpose in the coronation.
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.

GLOUCESTER:
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
Which by my presence might have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM:
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.

GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.

HASTINGS:
I thank your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord of Ely!

BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?

GLOUCESTER:
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
As he will lose his head ere give consent
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.

DERBY:
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
strawberries.

HASTINGS:
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
There's some conceit or other likes him well,
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
I think there's never a man in Christendom
That can less hide his love or hate than he;
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.

DERBY:
What of his heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?

HASTINGS:
Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

DERBY:
I pray God he be not, I say.

GLOUCESTER:
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Upon my body with their hellish charms?

HASTINGS:
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
Makes me most forward in this noble presence
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

HASTINGS:
If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--

GLOUCESTER:
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
I will not dine until I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.

HASTINGS:
Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
And I myself secure in grace and favour.
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.

HASTINGS:
O momentary grace of mortal men,
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.

LOVEL:
Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.

HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
And then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
And both are ready in their offices,
At any time, to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?

GLOUCESTER:
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
Look to the drawbridge there!

BUCKINGHAM:
Hark! a drum.

GLOUCESTER:
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.

BUCKINGHAM:
God and our innocency defend and guard us!

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVEL:
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

GLOUCESTER:
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
He lived from all attainder of suspect.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
That ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that, by great preservation,
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
This day had plotted, in the council-house
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

Lord Mayor:
What, had he so?

GLOUCESTER:
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
Enforced us to this execution?

Lord Mayor:
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never look'd for better at his hands,
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.

GLOUCESTER:
Yet had not we determined he should die,
Until your lordship came to see his death;
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens, who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

Lord Mayor:
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
As well as I had seen and heard him speak
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just proceedings in this cause.

GLOUCESTER:
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
To avoid the carping censures of the world.

BUCKINGHAM:
But since you come too late of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
Only for saying he would make his son
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
Without control, listed to make his prey.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
Tell them, when that my mother went with child
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And, by just computation of the time,
Found that the issue was not his begot;
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.

GLOUCESTER:
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

BUCKINGHAM:
I go: and towards three or four o'clock
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
Now will I in, to take some privy order,
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
And to give notice, that no manner of person
At any time have recourse unto the princes.

Scrivener:
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
The precedent was full as long a-doing:
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
That seeth not this palpable device?
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.

GLOUCESTER:
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.

GLOUCESTER:
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

BUCKINGHAM:
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father then in France,
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right idea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their country's good
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'

GLOUCESTER:
Ah! and did they so?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
His answer was, the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
'This general applause and loving shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
And even here brake off, and came away.

GLOUCESTER:
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my troth, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
And be not easily won to our request:
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.

GLOUCESTER:
I go; and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
What says he?

CATESBY:
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morrow or next day:
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
And no worldly suit would he be moved,
To draw him from his holy exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
In deep designs and matters of great moment,
No less importing than our general good,
Are come to have some conference with his grace.

CATESBY:
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knees at meditation;
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
But meditating with two deep divines;
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
Happy were England, would this gracious prince
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

Lord Mayor:
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
I fear he will.
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?

CATESBY:
My lord,
He wonders to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
And so once more return and tell his grace.
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
So sweet is zealous contemplation.

Lord Mayor:
See, where he stands between two clergymen!

BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
To stay him from the fall of vanity:
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
True ornaments to know a holy man.
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Lend favourable ears to our request;
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
Who, earnest in the service of my God,
Neglect the visitation of my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.

GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

BUCKINGHAM:
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!

GLOUCESTER:
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a blemished stock:
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
Which here we waken to our country's good,
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which to recure, we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land,
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
But as successively from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the citizens,
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
And by their vehement instigation,
In this just suit come I to move your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I know not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer, you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
So season'd with your faithful love to me.
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
First if all obstacles were cut away,
And that my path were even to the crown,
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
So mighty and so many my defects,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
Will well become the seat of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend that I should wring from him!

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstances well considered.
You say that Edward is your brother's son:
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
To Bona, sister to the King of France.
These both put by a poor petitioner,
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
More bitterly could I expostulate,
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
If non to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times,
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

Lord Mayor:
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.

CATESBY:
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
I am unfit for state and majesty;
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.

BUCKINGHAM:
If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have noted in you to your kin,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
But we will plant some other in the throne,
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
And in this resolution here we leave you.--
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.

GLOUCESTER:
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.

CATESBY:
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.

GLOUCESTER:
Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
I must have patience to endure the load:
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
How far I am from the desire thereof.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.

GLOUCESTER:
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Then I salute you with this kingly title:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

Lord Mayor:
Amen.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?

GLOUCESTER:
Even when you please, since you will have it so.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
And so most joyfully we take our leave.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met.

LADY ANNE:
God give your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

LADY ANNE:
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gentle princes there.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?

BRAKENBURY:
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to visit them;
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king! why, who's that?

BRAKENBURY:
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.

LADY ANNE:
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.

BRAKENBURY:
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.

LORD STANLEY:
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
With this dead-killing news!

LADY ANNE:
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!

DORSET:
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

LORD STANLEY:
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
You shall have letters from me to my son
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

LORD STANLEY:
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

LADY ANNE:
And I in all unwillingness will go.
I would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.

LADY ANNE:
No! why?  When he that is my husband now
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
For making me, so young, so old a widow!
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.

LADY ANNE:
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

LADY ANNE:
Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!

DUCHESS OF YORK:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
For tender princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

KING RICHARD III:
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!

BUCKINGHAM:
My gracious sovereign?

KING RICHARD III:
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
But shall we wear these honours for a day?
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?

BUCKINGHAM:
Still live they and for ever may they last!

KING RICHARD III:
O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be current gold indeed
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.

BUCKINGHAM:
Say on, my loving lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
True, noble prince.

KING RICHARD III:
O bitter consequence,
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace may do your pleasure.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

BUCKINGHAM:
Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
Before I positively herein:
I will resolve your grace immediately.

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:
I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys: none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!

Page:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?

Page:
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
Gold were as good as twenty orators,
And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.

KING RICHARD III:
What is his name?

Page:
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD III:
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
Hath he so long held out with me untired,
And stops he now for breath?
How now! what news with you?

STANLEY:
My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
Where he abides.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Rumour it abroad
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
About it; for it stands me much upon,
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
I must be married to my brother's daughter,
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Is thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

KING RICHARD III:
Art thou, indeed?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.

KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

TYRREL:
Ay, my lord;
But I had rather kill two enemies.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

TYRREL:
Let me have open means to come to them,
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

KING RICHARD III:
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
There is no more but so: say it is done,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.

TYRREL:
'Tis done, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shall, my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
The late demand that you did sound me in.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
I hear that news, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
The which you promised I should possess.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

BUCKINGHAM:
What says your highness to my just demand?

KING RICHARD III:
As I remember, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--

KING RICHARD III:
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promised me.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the stroke of ten.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let it strike?

KING RICHARD III:
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to-day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut,
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.

BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? rewards he my true service
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!

TYRREL:
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
The most arch of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
Within their innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature,
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I left them both,
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
And here he comes.
All hail, my sovereign liege!

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

TYRREL:
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
For it is done, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
But didst thou see them dead?

TYRREL:
I did, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
But how or in what place I do not know.

KING RICHARD III:
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
And be inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till soon.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

CATESBY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

CATESBY:
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So, now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mother's lamentation!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hover about her; say, that right for right
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
So many miseries have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

QUEEN MARGARET:
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?

QUEEN MARGARET:
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match not the high perfection of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
And the beholders of this tragic play,
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
To have him suddenly convey'd away.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of but what I was;
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
And left thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
These English woes will make me smile in France.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why should calamity be full of words?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have scope: though what they do impart
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.

KING RICHARD III:
Who intercepts my expedition?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Where should be graven, if that right were right,
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

KING RICHARD III:
A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou my son?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then patiently hear my impatience.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, let me speak!

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I'll not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.

KING RICHARD III:
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

KING RICHARD III:
And came I not at last to comfort you?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
That ever graced me in thy company?

KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
Strike the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, hear me speak.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak too bitterly.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hear me a word;
For I shall never speak to thee again.

KING RICHARD III:
So.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face again.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And there the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me; I say amen to all.

KING RICHARD III:
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
And therefore level not to hit their lives.

KING RICHARD III:
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she die for this? O, let her live,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

KING RICHARD III:
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

KING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her birth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only in that safety died her brothers.

KING RICHARD III:
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.

KING RICHARD III:
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend more good to you and yours,
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
To be discover'd, that can do me good?

KING RICHARD III:
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?

KING RICHARD III:
No, to the dignity and height of honour
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?

KING RICHARD III:
Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

KING RICHARD III:
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

KING RICHARD III:
What do you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.

KING RICHARD III:
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
And mean to make her queen of England.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

KING RICHARD III:
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What, thou?

KING RICHARD III:
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst thou woo her?

KING RICHARD III:
That would I learn of you,
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And wilt thou learn of me?

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, with all my heart.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
If this inducement force her not to love,
Send her a story of thy noble acts;
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
To win our daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is no other way
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
And not be Richard that hath done all this.

KING RICHARD III:
Say that I did all this for love of her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.

KING RICHARD III:
Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
A grandam's name is little less in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
Your children were vexation to your youth,
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
The loss you have is but a son being king,
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
I cannot make you what amends I would,
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity:
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Again shall you be mother to a king,
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
Advantaging their loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What were I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Under what title shall I woo for thee,
That God, the law, my honour and her love,
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?

KING RICHARD III:
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.

KING RICHARD III:
Say that the king, which may command, entreats.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To wail the tide, as her mother doth.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I will love her everlastingly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?

KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?

KING RICHARD III:
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

KING RICHARD III:
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.

KING RICHARD III:
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

KING RICHARD III:
Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By nothing; for this is no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

KING RICHARD III:
My father's death--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Then, by myself--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself misusest.

KING RICHARD III:
Why then, by God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's wrong is most of all.
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother made
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
Had graced the tender temples of my child,
And both the princes had been breathing here,
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
What canst thou swear by now?

KING RICHARD III:
The time to come.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
The children live, whose parents thou hast
slaughter'd,
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

KING RICHARD III:
As I intend to prosper and repent,
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
In her consists my happiness and thine;
Without her, follows to this land and me,
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
It cannot be avoided but by this;
It will not be avoided but by this.
Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I forget myself to be myself?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But thou didst kill my children.

KING RICHARD III:
But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

KING RICHARD III:
And be a happy mother by the deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I go. Write to me very shortly.
And you shall understand from me her mind.

KING RICHARD III:
Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
How now! what news?

RATCLIFF:
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

KING RICHARD III:
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?

CATESBY:
Here, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Fly to the duke:
Post thou to Salisbury
When thou comest thither--
Dull, unmindful villain,
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?

CATESBY:
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.

KING RICHARD III:
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest strength and power he can make,
And meet me presently at Salisbury.

CATESBY:
I go.

RATCLIFF:
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?

KING RICHARD III:
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?

RATCLIFF:
Your highness told me I should post before.

KING RICHARD III:
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
How now, what news with you?

STANLEY:
None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
Once more, what news?

STANLEY:
Richmond is on the seas.

KING RICHARD III:
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?

STANLEY:
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?

STANLEY:
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.

KING RICHARD III:
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?

STANLEY:
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

STANLEY:
No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.

KING RICHARD III:
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore.
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!

STANLEY:
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.

KING RICHARD III:
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?

STANLEY:
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
Please it your majesty to give me leave,
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
Where and what time your majesty shall please.

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
I will not trust you, sir.

STANLEY:
Most mighty sovereign,
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
I never was nor never will be false.

KING RICHARD III:
Well,
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

STANLEY:
So deal with him as I prove true to you.

Messenger:
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
As I by friends am well advertised,
Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
With many more confederates, are in arms.

Second Messenger:
My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
And every hour more competitors
Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.

Third Messenger:
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--

KING RICHARD III:
Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
Take that, until thou bring me better news.

Third Messenger:
The news I have to tell your majesty
Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
And he himself wander'd away alone,
No man knows whither.

KING RICHARD III:
I cry thee mercy:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?

Third Messenger:
Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.

Fourth Messenger:
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
If they were his assistants, yea or no;
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.

KING RICHARD III:
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

CATESBY:
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

KING RICHARD III:
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
A royal battle might be won and lost
Some one take order Buckingham be brought
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.

DERBY:
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
The fear of that withholds my present aid.
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
What men of name resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
And many more of noble fame and worth:
And towards London they do bend their course,
If by the way they be not fought withal.

DERBY:
Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

Sheriff:
No, my good lord; therefore be patient.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
If that your moody discontented souls
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
Even for revenge mock my destruction!
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?

Sheriff:
It is, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
False to his children or his wife's allies
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

RICHMOND:
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Have we march'd on without impediment;
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.

OXFORD:
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
To fight against that bloody homicide.

HERBERT:
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.

BLUNT:
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.

RICHMOND:
All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

KING RICHARD III:
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?

SURREY:
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.

KING RICHARD III:
My Lord of Norfolk,--

NORFOLK:
Here, most gracious liege.

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?

NORFOLK:
We must both give and take, my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the foe?

NORFOLK:
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

KING RICHARD III:
Why, our battalion trebles that account:
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of the field
Call for some men of sound direction
Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

RICHMOND:
The weary sun hath made a golden set,
And by the bright track of his fiery car,
Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
Give me some ink and paper in my tent
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
Limit each leader to his several charge,
And part in just proportion our small strength.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
And by the second hour in the morning
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?

BLUNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Which well I am assured I have not done,
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty power of the king.

RICHMOND:
If without peril it be possible,
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And give him from me this most needful scroll.

BLUNT:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!

RICHMOND:
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.

KING RICHARD III:
What is't o'clock?

CATESBY:
It's supper-time, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

KING RICHARD III:
I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armour laid into my tent?

CATESBY:
If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

KING RICHARD III:
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

NORFOLK:
I go, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
I warrant you, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

RATCLIFF:
Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.

KING RICHARD III:
So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

RATCLIFF:
It is, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Bid my guard watch; leave me.
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

DERBY:
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

RICHMOND:
All comfort that the dark night can afford
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

DERBY:
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
With best advantage will deceive the time,
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be executed in his father's sight.
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

RICHMOND:
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
When I should mount with wings of victory:
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
That we may praise thee in the victory!
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

Ghost of Prince Edward:

Ghost of King Henry VI:

Ghost of CLARENCE:

Ghost of RIVERS:

Ghost of GREY:

Ghost of VAUGHAN:

All:

Ghost of HASTINGS:

Ghosts of young Princes:

Ghost of LADY ANNE:

Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:

KING RICHARD III:
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
That I myself have done unto myself?
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
All several sins, all used in each degree,
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

RATCLIFF:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
'Zounds! who is there?

RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?

RATCLIFF:
No doubt, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

RATCLIFF:
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

KING RICHARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if any mean to shrink from me.

LORDS:
Good morrow, Richmond!

RICHMOND:
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

LORDS:
How have you slept, my lord?

RICHMOND:
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?

LORDS:
Upon the stroke of four.

RICHMOND:
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
One that made means to come by what he hath,
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever been God's enemy:
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country's foes,
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children's children quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

KING RICHARD III:
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
That he was never trained up in arms.

KING RICHARD III:
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?

RATCLIFF:
He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'

KING RICHARD III:
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun to-day?

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
The sun will not be seen to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

NORFOLK:
Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.

KING RICHARD III:
Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
And thus my battle shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse and foot;
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?

NORFOLK:
A good direction, warlike sovereign.
This found I on my tent this morning.

KING RICHARD III:

Messenger:
My lord, he doth deny to come.

KING RICHARD III:
Off with his son George's head!

NORFOLK:
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
After the battle let George Stanley die.

KING RICHARD III:
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
Advance our standards, set upon our foes
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

KING RICHARD III:
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.

KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.

DERBY:
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

RICHMOND:
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?

DERBY:
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

RICHMOND:
What men of name are slain on either side?

DERBY:
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.

RICHMOND:
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submission will return to us:
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white rose and the red:
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
All this divided York and Lancaster,
Divided in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
The true succeeders of each royal house,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
That would reduce these bloody days again,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
Let them not live to taste this land's increase
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she may long live here, God say amen!

KING RICHARD II:
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I have, my liege.

KING RICHARD II:
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II:
Then call them to our presence; face to face,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Many years of happy days befal
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still better other's happiness;
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Add an immortal title to your crown!

KING RICHARD II:
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
As well appeareth by the cause you come;
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love,
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
And free from other misbegotten hate,
Come I appellant to this princely presence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
My body shall make good upon this earth,
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
Which else would post until it had return'd
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
I do defy him, and I spit at him;
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Or any other ground inhabitable,
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
And when I mount, alive may I not light,
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!

KING RICHARD II:
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
Besides I say and will in battle prove,
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
That ever was survey'd by English eye,
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good,
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
To me for justice and rough chastisement;
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.

KING RICHARD II:
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Till I have told this slander of his blood,
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.

KING RICHARD II:
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
As he is but my father's brother's son,
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
The other part reserved I by consent,
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account,
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
The honourable father to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I last received the sacrament
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
It issues from the rancour of a villain,
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
Which in myself I boldly will defend;
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
Your highness to assign our trial day.

KING RICHARD II:
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
This we prescribe, though no physician;
Deep malice makes too deep incision;
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To be a make-peace shall become my age:
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.

KING RICHARD II:
And, Norfolk, throw down his.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
When, Harry, when?
Obedience bids I should not bid again.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
Which breathed this poison.

KING RICHARD II:
Rage must be withstood:
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation: that away,
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Take honour from me, and my life is done:
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
In that I live and for that will I die.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.

KING RICHARD II:
We were not born to sue, but to command;
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate:
Since we can not atone you, we shall see
Justice design the victor's chivalry.
Lord marshal, command our officers at arms
Be ready to direct these home alarms.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
To stir against the butchers of his life!
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
In some large measure to thy father's death,
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
Who was the model of thy father's life.
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
His deputy anointed in His sight,
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
An angry arm against His minister.

DUCHESS:
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To God, the widow's champion and defence.

DUCHESS:
Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
They may break his foaming courser's back,
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
With her companion grief must end her life.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
As much good stay with thee as go with me!

DUCHESS:
Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
I take my leave before I have begun,
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

Lord Marshal:
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.

Lord Marshal:
The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
For nothing but his majesty's approach.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:
Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
Who hither come engaged by my oath--
Which God defend a knight should violate!--
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
To God, my king and my succeeding issue,
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
To prove him, in defending of myself,
A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war,
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him in the justice of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

Lord Marshal:
On pain of death, no person be so bold
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
Except the marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct these fair designs.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
And bow my knee before his majesty:
For Mowbray and myself are like two men
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving farewell of our several friends.

Lord Marshal:
The appellant in all duty greets your highness,
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.

KING RICHARD II:
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
As confident as is the falcon's flight
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
Not sick, although I have to do with death,
But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
To reach at victory above my head,
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
Even in the lusty havior of his son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
Be swift like lightning in the execution;
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
However God or fortune cast my lot,
There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,
A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
This feast of battle with mine adversary.
Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
As gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, my lord: securely I espy
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.

Lord Marshal:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.

Lord Marshal:
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.

First Herald:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his God, his king and him;
And dares him to set forward to the fight.

Second Herald:
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
Both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
Courageously and with a free desire
Attending but the signal to begin.

Lord Marshal:
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.

KING RICHARD II:
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
And both return back to their chairs again:
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree.
Draw near,
And list what with our council we have done.
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
And for we think the eagle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
With rival-hating envy, set on you
To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,
Therefore, we banish you our territories:
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
And those his golden beams to you here lent
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
As to be cast forth in the common air,
Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
The language I have learn'd these forty years,
My native English, now I must forego:
And now my tongue's use is to me no more
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
Or, being open, put into his hands
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
Too far in years to be a pupil now:
What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?

KING RICHARD II:
It boots thee not to be compassionate:
After our sentence plaining comes too late.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.

KING RICHARD II:
Return again, and take an oath with thee.
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
To keep the oath that we administer:
You never shall, so help you truth and God!
Embrace each other's love in banishment;
Nor never look upon each other's face;
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
And I, to keep all this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
By this time, had the king permitted us,
One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
My name be blotted from the book of life,
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to England, all the world's my way.

KING RICHARD II:
Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
Hath from the number of his banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
Six frozen winter spent,
Return with welcome home from banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How long a time lies in one little word!
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I thank my liege, that in regard of me
He shortens four years of my son's exile:
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
Can change their moons and bring their times about
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
And blindfold death not let me see my son.

KING RICHARD II:
Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
Thy word is current with him for my death,
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.

KING RICHARD II:
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
You would have bid me argue like a father.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
I was too strict to make mine own away;
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myself this wrong.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
From where you do remain let paper show.

Lord Marshal:
My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
As far as land will let me, by your side.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I have too few to take my leave of you,
When the tongue's office should be prodigal
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy absent, grief is present for that time.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
What is six winters? they are quickly gone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
The precious jewel of thy home return.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in the end,
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
But that I was a journeyman to grief?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
All places that the eye of heaven visits
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
There is no virtue like necessity.
Think not the king did banish thee,
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
Suppose the singing birds musicians,
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
Than a delightful measure or a dance;
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, who can hold a fire in his hand
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
O, no! the apprehension of the good
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.

KING RICHARD II:
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, and there I left him.

KING RICHARD II:
And say, what store of parting tears were shed?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

KING RICHARD II:
What said our cousin when you parted with him?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
And added years to his short banishment,
He should have had a volume of farewells;
But since it would not, he had none of me.

KING RICHARD II:
He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
When time shall call him home from banishment,
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his courtship to the common people;
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy,
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune,
As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee,
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
As were our England in reversion his,
And he our subjects' next degree in hope.

GREEN:
Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
Ere further leisure yield them further means
For their advantage and your highness' loss.

KING RICHARD II:
We will ourself in person to this war:
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them after to supply our wants;
For we will make for Ireland presently.
Bushy, what news?

BUSHY:
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat your majesty to visit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Where lies he?

BUSHY:
At Ely House.

KING RICHARD II:
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
To help him to his grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!

All:
Amen.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?

DUKE OF YORK:
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, but they say the tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
He that no more must say is listen'd more
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
The setting sun, and music at the close,
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
The open ear of youth doth always listen;
Report of fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation.
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war,
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands,
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
For Christian service and true chivalry,
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
Dear for her reputation through the world,
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
England, bound in with the triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
That England, that was wont to conquer others,
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
How happy then were my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK:
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.

QUEEN:
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?

KING RICHARD II:
What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O how that name befits my composition!
Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.

KING RICHARD II:
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.

KING RICHARD II:
Should dying men flatter with those that live?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, no, men living flatter those that die.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.

KING RICHARD II:
I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
It were a shame to let this land by lease;
But for thy world enjoying but this land,
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--

KING RICHARD II:
A lunatic lean-witted fool,
Presuming on an ague's privilege,
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
With fury from his native residence.
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
For that I was his father Edward's son;
That blood already, like the pelican,
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
May be a precedent and witness good
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:
Join with the present sickness that I have;
And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
Love they to live that love and honour have.

KING RICHARD II:
And let them die that age and sullens have;
For both hast thou, and both become the grave.

DUKE OF YORK:
I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him:
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.

KING RICHARD II:
Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
What says he?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, nothing; all is said
His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.

DUKE OF YORK:
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

KING RICHARD II:
The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
Which live like venom where no venom else
But only they have privilege to live.
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
In war was never lion raged more fierce,
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
Than was that young and princely gentleman.
His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
But when he frown'd, it was against the French
And not against his friends; his noble hand
Did will what he did spend and spent not that
Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
Or else he never would compare between.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, uncle, what's the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
O my liege,
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
His charters and his customary rights;
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
Call in the letters patent that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.

KING RICHARD II:
Think what you will, we seize into our hands
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.

DUKE OF YORK:
I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good.

KING RICHARD II:
Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
To see this business. To-morrow next
We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
And we create, in absence of ourself,
Our uncle York lord governor of England;
For he is just and always loved us well.
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
Be merry, for our time of stay is short

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.

LORD ROSS:
And living too; for now his son is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in title, not in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justice had her right.

LORD ROSS:
My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.

LORD ROSS:
No good at all that I can do for him;
Unless you call it good to pity him,
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
In him, a royal prince, and many moe
Of noble blood in this declining land.
The king is not himself, but basely led
By flatterers; and what they will inform,
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
That will the king severely prosecute
'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.

LORD ROSS:
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And daily new exactions are devised,
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.

LORD ROSS:
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.

LORD ROSS:
He hath not money for these Irish wars,
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.

LORD ROSS:
We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
And unavoided is the danger now,
For suffering so the causes of our wreck.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering; but I dare not say
How near the tidings of our comfort is.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.

LORD ROSS:
Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
In Brittany, received intelligence
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
Are making hither with all due expedience
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
The first departing of the king for Ireland.
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
And make high majesty look like itself,
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
Stay and be secret, and myself will go.

LORD ROSS:
To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.

BUSHY:
Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
You promised, when you parted with the king,
To lay aside life-harming heaviness
And entertain a cheerful disposition.

QUEEN:
To please the king I did; to please myself
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
More than with parting from my lord the king.

BUSHY:
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing entire to many objects;
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

QUEEN:
It may be so; but yet my inward soul
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.

BUSHY:
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.

QUEEN:
'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
For nothing had begot my something grief;
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
But what it is, that is not yet known; what
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.

GREEN:
God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.

QUEEN:
Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?

GREEN:
That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
At Ravenspurgh.

QUEEN:
Now God in heaven forbid!

GREEN:
Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.

BUSHY:
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?

GREEN:
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
And all the household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke.

QUEEN:
So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

BUSHY:
Despair not, madam.

QUEEN:
Who shall hinder me?
I will despair, and be at enmity
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
A parasite, a keeper back of death,
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
Which false hope lingers in extremity.

GREEN:
Here comes the Duke of York.

QUEEN:
With signs of war about his aged neck:
O, full of careful business are his looks!
Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.

DUKE OF YORK:
Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
Here am I left to underprop his land,
Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.

Servant:
My lord, your son was gone before I came.

DUKE OF YORK:
He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
Hold, take my ring.

Servant:
My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.

DUKE OF YORK:
What is't, knave?

Servant:
An hour before I came, the duchess died.

DUKE OF YORK:
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what to do: I would to God,
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do for money for these wars?
Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
And bring away the armour that is there.
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
And meet me presently at Berkeley.
I should to Plashy too;
But time will not permit: all is uneven,
And every thing is left at six and seven.

BUSHY:
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
But none returns. For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible.

GREEN:
Besides, our nearness to the king in love
Is near the hate of those love not the king.

BAGOT:
And that's the wavering commons: for their love
Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.

BUSHY:
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
Because we ever have been near the king.

GREEN:
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.

BUSHY:
Thither will I with you; for little office
The hateful commons will perform for us,
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
Will you go along with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.

BUSHY:
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.

GREEN:
Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.

BUSHY:
Well, we may meet again.

BAGOT:
I fear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, noble lord,
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
But I bethink me what a weary way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
The tediousness and process of my travel:
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
The present benefit which I possess;
And hope to joy is little less in joy
Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
By sight of what I have, your noble company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of much less value is my company
Than your good words. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my son, young Harry Percy,
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
Harry, how fares your uncle?

HENRY PERCY:
I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why, is he not with the queen?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
Broken his staff of office and dispersed
The household of the king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was his reason?
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.

HENRY PERCY:
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
What power the Duke of York had levied there;
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
I never in my life did look on him.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.

HENRY PERCY:
My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
I count myself in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends;
And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
Keeps good old York there with his men of war?

HENRY PERCY:
There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
None else of name and noble estimate.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
Shall be your love and labour's recompense.

LORD ROSS:
Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.

LORD BERKELEY:
My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
And I am come to seek that name in England;
And I must find that title in your tongue,
Before I make reply to aught you say.

LORD BERKELEY:
Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
To raze one title of your honour out:
To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
From the most gracious regent of this land,
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
To take advantage of the absent time
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I shall not need transport my words by you;
Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
Whose duty is deceiveable and false.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle--

DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
And ostentation of despised arms?
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
And minister correction to thy fault!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
On what condition stands it and wherein?

DUKE OF YORK:
Even in condition of the worst degree,
In gross rebellion and detested treason:
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
Before the expiration of thy time,
In braving arms against thy sovereign.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
You are my father, for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England,
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
I am denied to sue my livery here,
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
What would you have me do? I am a subject,
And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
And therefore, personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath been too much abused.

LORD ROSS:
It stands your grace upon to do him right.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Base men by his endowments are made great.

DUKE OF YORK:
My lords of England, let me tell you this:
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
And laboured all I could to do him right;
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
Be his own carver and cut out his way,
To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
And you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; and for the right of that
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
Because my power is weak and all ill left:
But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
But since I cannot, be it known to you
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
Unless you please to enter in the castle
And there repose you for this night.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
But we must win your grace to go with us
To Bristol castle, which they say is held
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

DUKE OF YORK:
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
For I am loath to break our country's laws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
Things past redress are now with me past care.

Captain:
My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.

Captain:
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
The other to enjoy by rage and war:
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
As well assured Richard their king is dead.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bring forth these men.
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
With too much urging your pernicious lives,
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
From off my hands, here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
You have in manner with your sinful hours
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
Broke the possession of a royal bed
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
Near to the king in blood, and near in love
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Save men's opinions and my living blood,
To show the world I am a gentleman.
This and much more, much more than twice all this,
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
To execution and the hand of death.

BUSHY:
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.

GREEN:
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
With letters of your love to her at large.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
To fight with Glendower and his complices:
Awhile to work, and after holiday.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?

KING RICHARD II:
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
To stand upon my kingdom once again.
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
As a long-parted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee favours with my royal hands.
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
The proffer'd means of succor and redress.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole,
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
Not able to endure the sight of day,
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord:
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?

KING RICHARD II:
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
And, till so much blood thither come again,
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.

KING RICHARD II:
I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
More health and happiness betide my liege
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!

KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
And what loss is it to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
They break their faith to God as well as us:
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
The worst is death, and death will have his day.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
To bear the tidings of calamity.
Like an unseasonable stormy day,
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
So high above his limits swells the rage
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke my father with his power?

KING RICHARD II:
No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
As if this flesh which walls about our life,
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all this while:
I live with bread like you, feel want,
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
How can you say to me, I am a king?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
But presently prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
And so your follies fight against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
And fight and die is death destroying death;
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father hath a power; inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
An easy task it is to win our own.
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Men judge by the complexion of the sky
The state and inclination of the day:
So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
I play the torturer, by small and small
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
And all your northern castles yielded up,
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou hast said enough.
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
What say you now? what comfort have we now?
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
That bids me be of comfort any more.
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
That power I have, discharge; and let them go
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
For I have none: let no man speak again
To alter this, for counsel is but vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My liege, one word.

KING RICHARD II:
He does me double wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
With some few private friends upon this coast.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The news is very fair and good, my lord:
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.

DUKE OF YORK:
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
Left I his title out.

DUKE OF YORK:
The time hath been,
Would you have been so brief with him, he would
Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,
For taking so the head, your whole head's length.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.

DUKE OF YORK:
Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Against their will. But who comes here?
Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?

HENRY PERCY:
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
Against thy entrance.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Royally!
Why, it contains no king?

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, my good lord,
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Noble lords,
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
Henry Bolingbroke
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most royal person, hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
Provided that my banishment repeal'd
And lands restored again be freely granted:
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
Go, signify as much, while here we march
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
Our fair appointments may be well perused.
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no less terror than the elements
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
As doth the blushing discontented sun
From out the fiery portal of the east,
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occident.

DUKE OF YORK:
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
That any harm should stain so fair a show!

KING RICHARD II:
We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to our presence?
If we be not, show us the hand of God
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though you think that all, as you have done,
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
And we are barren and bereft of friends;
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your vassal hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
The purple testament of bleeding war;
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation and bedew
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
And by the honourable tomb he swears,
That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
And by the royalties of both your bloods,
Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
And by the worth and honour of himself,
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
His coming hither hath no further scope
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
Which on thy royal party granted once,
His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
To faithful service of your majesty.
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
And all the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
With all the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
Defiance to the traitor, and so die?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.

KING RICHARD II:
O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
That laid the sentence of dread banishment
On yon proud man, should take it off again
With words of sooth! O that I were as great
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
Or that I could forget what I have been,
Or not remember what I must be now!
Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
What must the king do now? must he submit?
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
The king shall be contented: must he lose
The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
My subjects for a pair of carved saints
And my large kingdom for a little grave,
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
And buried once, why not upon my head?
Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
And make a dearth in this revolting land.
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, in the base court he doth attend
To speak with you; may it please you to come down.

KING RICHARD II:
Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What says his majesty?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
Yet he is come.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Stand all apart,
And show fair duty to his majesty.
My gracious lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
Thus high at least, although your knee be low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.

KING RICHARD II:
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
As my true service shall deserve your love.

KING RICHARD II:
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
Though you are old enough to be my heir.
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
For do we must what force will have us do.
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yea, my good lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Then I must not say no.

QUEEN:
What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
To drive away the heavy thought of care?

Lady:
Madam, we'll play at bowls.

QUEEN:
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
And that my fortune rubs against the bias.

Lady:
Madam, we'll dance.

QUEEN:
My legs can keep no measure in delight,
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.

Lady:
Madam, we'll tell tales.

QUEEN:
Of sorrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN:
Of neither, girl:
For of joy, being altogether wanting,
It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
Or if of grief, being altogether had,
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
For what I have I need not to repeat;
And what I want it boots not to complain.

Lady:
Madam, I'll sing.

QUEEN:
'Tis well that thou hast cause
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.

Lady:
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

QUEEN:
And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
And never borrow any tear of thee.
But stay, here come the gardeners:
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.

Gardener:
Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Which, like unruly children, make their sire
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
Go thou, and like an executioner,
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
All must be even in our government.
You thus employ'd, I will go root away
The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.

Servant:
Why should we in the compass of a pale
Keep law and form and due proportion,
Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
Swarming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
Hold thy peace:
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

Servant:
What, are they dead?

Gardener:
They are; and Bolingbroke
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden! We at time of year
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
With too much riches it confound itself:
Had he done so to great and growing men,
They might have lived to bear and he to taste
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.

Servant:
What, think you then the king shall be deposed?

Gardener:
Depress'd he is already, and deposed
'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
That tell black tidings.

QUEEN:
O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
To make a second fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.

Gardener:
Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
And some few vanities that make him light;
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
Besides himself, are all the English peers,
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
Post you to London, and you will find it so;
I speak no more than every one doth know.

QUEEN:
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st
To serve me last, that I may longest keep
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
To meet at London London's king in woe.
What, was I born to this, that my sad look
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

GARDENER:
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
In the remembrance of a weeping queen.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Call forth Bagot.
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
The bloody office of his timeless end.

BAGOT:
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.

BAGOT:
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
That reacheth from the restful English court
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
Amongst much other talk, that very time,
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
Adding withal how blest this land would be
In this your cousin's death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Princes and noble lords,
What answer shall I make to this base man?
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
On equal terms to give him chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one, I would he were the best
In all this presence that hath moved me so.

LORD FITZWATER:
If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.

LORD FITZWATER:
Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.

HENRY PERCY:
Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
To prove it on thee to the extremest point
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
An if I do not, may my hands rot off
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!

Lord:
I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
And spur thee on with full as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
To answer twenty thousand such as you.

DUKE OF SURREY:
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.

LORD FITZWATER:
'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
And you can witness with me this is true.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.

LORD FITZWATER:
Surrey, thou liest.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonourable boy!
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

LORD FITZWATER:
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,
And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,
To tie thee to my strong correction.
As I intend to thrive in this new world,
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
To execute the noble duke at Calais.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These differences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
And, though mine enemy, restored again
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
To Italy; and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasant country's earth,
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
Under whose colours he had fought so long.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your days of trial.

DUKE OF YORK:
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
To the possession of thy royal hand:
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. God forbid!
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Would God that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a Christian climate souls refined
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood of English shall manure the ground,
And future ages groan for this foul act;
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
O, if you raise this house against this house,
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
Of capital treason we arrest you here.
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
To keep him safely till his day of trial.
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
He may surrender; so we shall proceed
Without suspicion.

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be his conduct.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your love,
And little look'd for at your helping hands.

KING RICHARD II:
Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of these men: were they not mine?
Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.
God save the king! Will no man say amen?
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
God save the king! although I be not he;
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
To do what service am I sent for hither?

DUKE OF YORK:
To do that office of thine own good will
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
The resignation of thy state and crown
To Henry Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
Here cousin:
On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
Now is this golden crown like a deep well
That owes two buckets, filling one another,
The emptier ever dancing in the air,
The other down, unseen and full of water:
That bucket down and full of tears am I,
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought you had been willing to resign.

KING RICHARD II:
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
You may my glories and my state depose,
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.

KING RICHARD II:
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
The cares I give I have, though given away;
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are you contented to resign the crown?

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
I give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
With mine own hands I give away my crown,
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
And send him many years of sunshine days!
What more remains?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No more, but that you read
These accusations and these grievous crimes
Committed by your person and your followers
Against the state and profit of this land;
That, by confessing them, the souls of men
May deem that you are worthily deposed.

KING RICHARD II:
Must I do so? and must I ravel out
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
If thy offences were upon record,
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
Containing the deposing of a king
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
And water cannot wash away your sin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
And yet salt water blinds them not so much
But they can see a sort of traitors here.
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
I find myself a traitor with the rest;
For I have given here my soul's consent
To undeck the pompous body of a king;
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
No, not that name was given me at the font,
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
That I have worn so many winters out,
And know not now what name to call myself!
O that I were a mockery king of snow,
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
To melt myself away in water-drops!
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
An if my word be sterling yet in England,
Let it command a mirror hither straight,
That it may show me what a face I have,
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.

KING RICHARD II:
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The commons will not then be satisfied.

KING RICHARD II:
They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
When I do see the very book indeed
Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
So many blows upon this face of mine,
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
Like to my followers in prosperity,
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
That every day under his household roof
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
Was this the face that faced so many follies,
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
A brittle glory shineth in this face:
As brittle as the glory is the face;
For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
The shadow or your face.

KING RICHARD II:
Say that again.
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
And these external manners of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
For thy great bounty, that not only givest
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
And then be gone and trouble you no more.
Shall I obtain it?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Name it, fair cousin.

KING RICHARD II:
'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
For when I was a king, my flatterers
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
I have a king here to my flatterer.
Being so great, I have no need to beg.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yet ask.

KING RICHARD II:
And shall I have?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall.

KING RICHARD II:
Then give me leave to go.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Whither?

KING RICHARD II:
Whither you will, so I were from your sights.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.

KING RICHARD II:
O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.

Abbot:
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
You holy clergymen, is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My lord,
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
I see your brows are full of discontent,
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay
A plot shall show us all a merry day.

QUEEN:
This way the king will come; this is the way
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
Have any resting for her true king's queen.
But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,
When triumph is become an alehouse guest?

KING RICHARD II:
Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
To think our former state a happy dream;
From which awaked, the truth of what we are
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
To grim Necessity, and he and I
Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
Which our profane hours here have stricken down.

QUEEN:
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
And fawn on rage with base humility,
Which art a lion and a king of beasts?

KING RICHARD II:
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
I had been still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassion weep the fire out;
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
For the deposing of a rightful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
With all swift speed you must away to France.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
The time shall not be many hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,
Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
It is too little, helping him to all;
And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
Being ne'er so little urged, another way
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
The love of wicked men converts to fear;
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
To worthy danger and deserved death.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.

KING RICHARD II:
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
And then betwixt me and my married wife.
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
She came adorned hither like sweet May,
Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.

QUEEN:
And must we be divided? must we part?

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.

QUEEN:
Banish us both and send the king with me.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
That were some love but little policy.

QUEEN:
Then whither he goes, thither let me go.

KING RICHARD II:
So two, together weeping, make one woe.
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.

QUEEN:
So longest way shall have the longest moans.

KING RICHARD II:
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.

QUEEN:
Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.

KING RICHARD II:
We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
of our two cousins coming into London.

DUKE OF YORK:
Where did I leave?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
At that sad stop, my lord,
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

DUKE OF YORK:
Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
Bolingbroke!'
You would have thought the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage, and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?

DUKE OF YORK:
As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face still combating with tears and smiles,
The badges of his grief and patience,
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
And barbarism itself have pitied him.
But heaven hath a hand in these events,
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Here comes my son Aumerle.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
I am in parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
God knows I had as lief be none as one.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For aught I know, my lord, they do.

DUKE OF YORK:
You will be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
If God prevent not, I purpose so.

DUKE OF YORK:
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, 'tis nothing.

DUKE OF YORK:
No matter, then, who see it;
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
It is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
I fear, I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What should you fear?
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.

DUKE OF YORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, let me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.

DUKE OF YORK:
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Ho! who is within there?
Saddle my horse.
God for his mercy, what treachery is here!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, what is it, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
I will appeach the villain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, foolish woman.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother, be content; it is no more
Than my poor life must answer.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thy life answer!

DUKE OF YORK:
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou fond mad woman,
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
And interchangeably set down their hands,
To kill the king at Oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He shall be none;
We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?

DUKE OF YORK:
Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
I would appeach him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hadst thou groan'd for him
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
He is as like thee as a man may be,
Not like to me, or any of my kin,
And yet I love him.

DUKE OF YORK:
Make way, unruly woman!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Spur post, and get before him to the king,
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
And never will I rise up from the ground
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
I would to God, my lords, he might be found:
Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
With unrestrained loose companions,
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
Takes on the point of honour to support
So dissolute a crew.

HENRY PERCY:
My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And what said the gallant?

HENRY PERCY:
His answer was, he would unto the stews,
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
And wear it as a favour; and with that
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the king?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What means our cousin, that he stares and looks
So wildly?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
To have some conference with your grace alone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
What is the matter with our cousin now?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Intended or committed was this fault?
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
To win thy after-love I pardon thee.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
That no man enter till my tale be done.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Have thy desire.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, I'll make thee safe.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is the matter, uncle? speak;
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
That we may arm us to encounter it.

DUKE OF YORK:
Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
The treason that my haste forbids me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me; read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand.

DUKE OF YORK:
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
O loyal father of a treacherous son!
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
This deadly blot in thy digressing son.

DUKE OF YORK:
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.

DUKE OF YORK:
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
This let alone will all the rest confound.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
Love loving not itself none other can.

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Rise up, good aunt.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For ever will I walk upon my knees,
And never see day that the happy sees,
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.

DUKE OF YORK:
Against them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
He prays but faintly and would be denied;
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE OF YORK:
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
That set'st the word itself against the word!
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chopping French we do not understand.
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do not sue to stand;
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
But makes one pardon strong.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With all my heart
I pardon him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on earth thou art.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
With all the rest of that consorted crew,
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
Good uncle, help to order several powers
To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:
They shall not live within this world, I swear,
But I will have them, if I once know where.
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.

EXTON:
Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
Was it not so?

Servant:
These were his very words.

EXTON:
'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
And urged it twice together, did he not?

Servant:
He did.

EXTON:
And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.

KING RICHARD II:
I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world:
And for because the world is populous
And here is not a creature but myself,
I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
My soul the father; and these two beget
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
And these same thoughts people this little world,
In humours like the people of this world,
For no thought is contented. The better sort,
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
With scruples and do set the word itself
Against the word:
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
That many have and others must sit there;
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
Of such as have before endured the like.
Thus play I in one person many people,
And none contented: sometimes am I king;
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: then crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a king;
Then am I king'd again: and by and by
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
Nor I nor any man that but man is
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
With being nothing. Music do I hear?
Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
When time is broke and no proportion kept!
So is it in the music of men's lives.
And here have I the daintiness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
But for the concord of my state and time
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
This music mads me; let it sound no more;
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

Groom:
Hail, royal prince!

KING RICHARD II:
Thanks, noble peer;
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
Where no man never comes but that sad dog
That brings me food to make misfortune live?

Groom:
I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
With much ado at length have gotten leave
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
In London streets, that coronation-day,
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!

KING RICHARD II:
Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
How went he under him?

Groom:
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.

KING RICHARD II:
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
Since thou, created to be awed by man,
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.

Keeper:
Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.

KING RICHARD II:
If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.

Groom:
What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.

Keeper:
My lord, will't please you to fall to?

KING RICHARD II:
Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
lately came from the king, commands the contrary.

KING RICHARD II:
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.

Keeper:
Help, help, help!

KING RICHARD II:
How now! what means death in this rude assault?
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.

EXTON:
As full of valour as of royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
For now the devil, that told me I did well,
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
This dead king to the living king I'll bear
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my lord what is the news?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
The next news is, I have to London sent
The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:
The manner of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.

HENRY PERCY:
The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
But here is Carlisle living, to abide
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is your doom:
Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.

EXTON:
Great king, within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land.

EXTON:
From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
They love not poison that do poison need,
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
But neither my good word nor princely favour:
With Cain go wander through shades of night,
And never show thy head by day nor light.
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
And put on sullen black incontinent:
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
In weeping after this untimely bier.


SAMPSON:
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

GREGORY:
No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSON:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGORY:
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

SAMPSON:
I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY:
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON:
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

GREGORY:
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON:
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

GREGORY:
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.

SAMPSON:
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.

GREGORY:
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON:
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.

GREGORY:
The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON:
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.

GREGORY:
They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON:
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

GREGORY:
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the house of the Montagues.

SAMPSON:
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

GREGORY:
How! turn thy back and run?

SAMPSON:
Fear me not.

GREGORY:
No, marry; I fear thee!

SAMPSON:
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

GREGORY:
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
they list.

SAMPSON:
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
I do bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
bite my thumb, sir.

GREGORY:
Do you quarrel, sir?

ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON:
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

ABRAHAM:
No better.

SAMPSON:
Well, sir.

GREGORY:
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

SAMPSON:
Yes, better, sir.

ABRAHAM:
You lie.

SAMPSON:
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

BENVOLIO:
Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

TYBALT:
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

BENVOLIO:
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

TYBALT:
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!

First Citizen:
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

CAPULET:
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET:
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

CAPULET:
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

MONTAGUE:
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE:
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

MONTAGUE:
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BENVOLIO:
Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE:
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

MONTAGUE:
I neither know it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO:
Have you importuned him by any means?

MONTAGUE:
Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.

BENVOLIO:
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

MONTAGUE:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO:
Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine.

ROMEO:
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO:
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO:
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

BENVOLIO:
In love?

ROMEO:
Out--

BENVOLIO:
Of love?

ROMEO:
Out of her favour, where I am in love.

BENVOLIO:
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

ROMEO:
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO:
No, coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO:
Good heart, at what?

BENVOLIO:
At thy good heart's oppression.

ROMEO:
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO:
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

BENVOLIO:
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

ROMEO:
What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.

ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

ROMEO:
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

BENVOLIO:
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO:
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

BENVOLIO:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

ROMEO:
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO:
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

ROMEO:
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO:
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

CAPULET:
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

PARIS:
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET:
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS:
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

Servant:
Find them out whose names are written here! It is
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ, and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.

ROMEO:
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO:
For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO:
For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO:
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

Servant:
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO:
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

Servant:
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?

ROMEO:
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

Servant:
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO:
Stay, fellow; I can read.
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should they come?

Servant:
Up.

ROMEO:
Whither?

Servant:
To supper; to our house.

ROMEO:
Whose house?

Servant:
My master's.

ROMEO:
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

Servant:
Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!

BENVOLIO:
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO:
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO:
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

LADY CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

Nurse:
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

JULIET:
How now! who calls?

Nurse:
Your mother.

JULIET:
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

LADY CAPULET:
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

Nurse:
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET:
She's not fourteen.

Nurse:
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
A fortnight and odd days.

Nurse:
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET:
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse:
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

JULIET:
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

Nurse:
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?

JULIET:
It is an honour that I dream not of.

Nurse:
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

Nurse:
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

Nurse:
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

LADY CAPULET:
What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.

Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET:
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

JULIET:
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

Servant:
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

LADY CAPULET:
We follow thee.
Juliet, the county stays.

Nurse:
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

ROMEO:
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?

BENVOLIO:
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO:
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

MERCUTIO:
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO:
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO:
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO:
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

MERCUTIO:
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in:
A visor for a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

BENVOLIO:
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.

ROMEO:
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO:
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO:
Nay, that's not so.

MERCUTIO:
I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

ROMEO:
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I dream'd a dream to-night.

MERCUTIO:
And so did I.

ROMEO:
Well, what was yours?

MERCUTIO:
That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO:
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she--

ROMEO:
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.

MERCUTIO:
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

BENVOLIO:
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

ROMEO:
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

BENVOLIO:
Strike, drum.

First Servant:
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

Second Servant:
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Servant:
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servant:
Ay, boy, ready.

First Servant:
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.

Second Servant:
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

Second Capulet:
By'r lady, thirty years.

CAPULET:
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

Second Capulet:
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.

CAPULET:
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

ROMEO:

Servant:
I know not, sir.

ROMEO:
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT:
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET:
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT:
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.

CAPULET:
Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT:
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT:
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.

CAPULET:
He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

TYBALT:
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

CAPULET:
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT:
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO:
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET:
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET:
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO:
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET:
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO:
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET:
You kiss by the book.

Nurse:
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

ROMEO:
What is her mother?

Nurse:
Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO:
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

ROMEO:
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET:
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to my rest.

JULIET:
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

Nurse:
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

JULIET:
What's he that now is going out of door?

Nurse:
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET:
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

Nurse:
I know not.

JULIET:
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

Nurse:
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET:
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.

Nurse:
What's this? what's this?

JULIET:
A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.

Nurse:
Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

Chorus:
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO:
He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO:
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

BENVOLIO:
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

MERCUTIO:
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO:
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

ROMEO:
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!

JULIET:
Ay me!

ROMEO:
She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET:
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO:
I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET:
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO:
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

JULIET:
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO:
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET:
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO:
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

JULIET:
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET:
I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO:
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET:
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

ROMEO:
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.

JULIET:
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

JULIET:
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO:
What shall I swear by?

JULIET:
Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO:
If my heart's dear love--

JULIET:
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEO:
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET:
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

ROMEO:
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET:
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.

ROMEO:
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

JULIET:
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

JULIET:
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Nurse:

JULIET:
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--

Nurse:

JULIET:
By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.

ROMEO:
So thrive my soul--

JULIET:
A thousand times good night!

ROMEO:
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

JULIET:
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO:
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!

JULIET:
Romeo!

ROMEO:
My dear?

JULIET:
At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO:
At the hour of nine.

JULIET:
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO:
Let me stand here till thou remember it.

JULIET:
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.

ROMEO:
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

JULIET:
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO:
I would I were thy bird.

JULIET:
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

ROMEO:
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

ROMEO:
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

ROMEO:
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?

ROMEO:
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

ROMEO:
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

ROMEO:
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO:
And bad'st me bury love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another out to have.

ROMEO:
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

ROMEO:
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

MERCUTIO:
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?

BENVOLIO:
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO:
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

MERCUTIO:
A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer it.

MERCUTIO:
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO:
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared.

MERCUTIO:
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
very first house, of the first and second cause:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!

BENVOLIO:
The what?

MERCUTIO:
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!

BENVOLIO:
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

MERCUTIO:
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

ROMEO:
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO:
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

MERCUTIO:
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO:
Meaning, to court'sy.

MERCUTIO:
Thou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

ROMEO:
Pink for flower.

MERCUTIO:
Right.

ROMEO:
Why, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO:
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.

MERCUTIO:
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO:
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?

ROMEO:
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose.

MERCUTIO:
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO:
Nay, good goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO:
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.

ROMEO:
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO:
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!

ROMEO:
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

MERCUTIO:
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

BENVOLIO:
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

ROMEO:
Here's goodly gear!

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO:
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse:
Peter!

PETER:
Anon!

Nurse:
My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO:
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
fairer face.

Nurse:
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO:
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

Nurse:
Is it good den?

MERCUTIO:
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon.

Nurse:
Out upon you! what a man are you!

ROMEO:
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
mar.

Nurse:
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo?

ROMEO:
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

Nurse:
You say well.

MERCUTIO:
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.

Nurse:
if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
you.

BENVOLIO:
She will indite him to some supper.

MERCUTIO:
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO:
What hast thou found?

MERCUTIO:
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.

ROMEO:
I will follow you.

MERCUTIO:
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
'lady, lady, lady.'

Nurse:
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

ROMEO:
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month.

Nurse:
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

PETER:
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quarrel, and the law on my side.

Nurse:
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

ROMEO:
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee--

Nurse:
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO:
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

Nurse:
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

ROMEO:
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

Nurse:
No truly sir; not a penny.

ROMEO:
Go to; I say you shall.

Nurse:
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

Nurse:
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

ROMEO:
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

Nurse:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

ROMEO:
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

NURSE:
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

Nurse:
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins with some other
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
to hear it.

ROMEO:
Commend me to thy lady.

Nurse:
Ay, a thousand times.
Peter!

PETER:
Anon!

Nurse:
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

JULIET:
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gate.

JULIET:
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

Nurse:
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

JULIET:
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

Nurse:
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?

JULIET:
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

Nurse:
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET:
No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?

Nurse:
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

JULIET:
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

JULIET:
Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'

Nurse:
O God's lady dear!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

JULIET:
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

Nurse:
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

JULIET:
I have.

Nurse:
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

JULIET:
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

ROMEO:
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET:
Good even to my ghostly confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

JULIET:
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.

JULIET:
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.

BENVOLIO:
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO:
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

BENVOLIO:
Am I like such a fellow?

MERCUTIO:
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO:
And what to?

MERCUTIO:
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

BENVOLIO:
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO:
The fee-simple! O simple!

BENVOLIO:
By my head, here come the Capulets.

MERCUTIO:
By my heel, I care not.

TYBALT:
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

MERCUTIO:
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
something; make it a word and a blow.

TYBALT:
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
will give me occasion.

MERCUTIO:
Could you not take some occasion without giving?

TYBALT:
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

MERCUTIO:
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

TYBALT:
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

MERCUTIO:
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

TYBALT:
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

TYBALT:
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

ROMEO:
I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

MERCUTIO:
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT:
What wouldst thou have with me?

MERCUTIO:
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.

TYBALT:
I am for you.

ROMEO:
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

MERCUTIO:
Come, sir, your passado.

ROMEO:
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO:
What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO:
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

ROMEO:
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

MERCUTIO:
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your arm.

ROMEO:
I thought all for the best.

MERCUTIO:
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!

ROMEO:
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

BENVOLIO:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

ROMEO:
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must end.

BENVOLIO:
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO:
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

TYBALT:
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.

ROMEO:
This shall determine that.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO:
O, I am fortune's fool!

BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou stay?

First Citizen:
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO:
There lies that Tybalt.

First Citizen:
Up, sir, go with me;
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.

PRINCE:
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

BENVOLIO:
O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET:
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET:
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE:
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE:
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.

PRINCE:
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
Ay, ay, the cords.

JULIET:
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

JULIET:
Can heaven be so envious?

Nurse:
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

JULIET:
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse:
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

JULIET:
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

Nurse:
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!

JULIET:
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

JULIET:
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

Nurse:
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

JULIET:
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!

Nurse:
There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!

JULIET:
Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

Nurse:
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

JULIET:
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

Nurse:
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

JULIET:
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

Nurse:
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

JULIET:
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.

ROMEO:
Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

ROMEO:
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
Not body's death, but body's banishment.

ROMEO:
Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

ROMEO:
There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

ROMEO:
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

ROMEO:
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

ROMEO:
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

ROMEO:
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO:
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.

ROMEO:
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

Nurse:

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Welcome, then.

Nurse:
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

Nurse:
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

ROMEO:
Nurse!

Nurse:
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

ROMEO:
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

Nurse:
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.

ROMEO:
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.

Nurse:
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

ROMEO:
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

Nurse:
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

ROMEO:
How well my comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

ROMEO:
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

CAPULET:
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

PARIS:
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
But, soft! what day is this?

PARIS:
Monday, my lord,

CAPULET:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

PARIS:
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

CAPULET:
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.

JULIET:
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

ROMEO:
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

JULIET:
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

ROMEO:
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

JULIET:
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

ROMEO:
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

Nurse:
Madam!

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.

JULIET:
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

JULIET:
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

ROMEO:
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET:
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO:
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.

JULIET:
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO:
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

JULIET:
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.

LADY CAPULET:

JULIET:
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now, Juliet!

JULIET:
Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET:
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET:
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET:
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

JULIET:
Feeling so the loss,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

JULIET:
What villain madam?

LADY CAPULET:
That same villain, Romeo.

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET:
That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

JULIET:
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

LADY CAPULET:
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

JULIET:
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET:
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

JULIET:
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

JULIET:
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

LADY CAPULET:
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.

CAPULET:
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!

CAPULET:
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

JULIET:
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

CAPULET:
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET:
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

JULIET:
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

CAPULET:
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

Nurse:
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET:
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

Nurse:
I speak no treason.

CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

Nurse:
May not one speak?

CAPULET:
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need it not.

LADY CAPULET:
You are too hot.

CAPULET:
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

JULIET:
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.

Nurse:
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

JULIET:
Speakest thou from thy heart?

Nurse:
And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.

JULIET:
Amen!

Nurse:
What?

JULIET:
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolved.

Nurse:
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

JULIET:
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

PARIS:
My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

PARIS:
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:

PARIS:
Happily met, my lady and my wife!

JULIET:
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

PARIS:
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

JULIET:
What must be shall be.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That's a certain text.

PARIS:
Come you to make confession to this father?

JULIET:
To answer that, I should confess to you.

PARIS:
Do not deny to him that you love me.

JULIET:
I will confess to you that I love him.

PARIS:
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

JULIET:
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

PARIS:
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

JULIET:
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.

PARIS:
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

JULIET:
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

PARIS:
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

JULIET:
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

PARIS:
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

JULIET:
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.

JULIET:
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution.
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That copest with death himself to scape from it:
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

JULIET:
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then, as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET:
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

JULIET:
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!

CAPULET:
So many guests invite as here are writ.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

Second Servant:
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
can lick their fingers.

CAPULET:
How canst thou try them so?

Second Servant:
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET:
Go, be gone.
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

Nurse:
Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET:
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

Nurse:
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

CAPULET:
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

JULIET:
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

CAPULET:
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

JULIET:
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

CAPULET:
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET:
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

LADY CAPULET:
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

LADY  CAPULET:
We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

CAPULET:
Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

JULIET:
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

LADY CAPULET:
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

JULIET:
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

LADY CAPULET:
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse:
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

CAPULET:
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.

Nurse:
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching.

CAPULET:
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

CAPULET:
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Now, fellow,
What's there?

First Servant:
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

CAPULET:
Make haste, make haste.
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

Second Servant:
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
And never trouble Peter for the matter.

CAPULET:
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.

Nurse:
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

LADY CAPULET:
What noise is here?

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
What is the matter?

Nurse:
Look, look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help! Call help.

CAPULET:
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

Nurse:
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

LADY CAPULET:
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

CAPULET:
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET:
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

PARIS:
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET:
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

Nurse:
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day, O woful day!

PARIS:
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid:
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well married that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
In all her best array bear her to church:
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

CAPULET:
All things that we ordained festival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

First Musician:
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

Nurse:
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

First Musician:
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

PETER:
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

First Musician:
Why 'Heart's ease?'

PETER:
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
to comfort me.

First Musician:
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

PETER:
You will not, then?

First Musician:
No.

PETER:
I will then give it you soundly.

First Musician:
What will you give us?

PETER:
No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
I will give you the minstrel.

First Musician:
Then I will give you the serving-creature.

PETER:
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
I'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician:
An you re us and fa us, you note us.

Second Musician:
Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

PETER:
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
me like men:
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
Then music with her silver sound'--
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?

Musician:
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

PETER:
Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

Second Musician:
I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

PETER:
Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

Third Musician:
Faith, I know not what to say.

PETER:
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
because musicians have no gold for sounding:
'Then music with her silver sound
With speedy help doth lend redress.'

First Musician:
What a pestilent knave is this same!

Second Musician:
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
mourners, and stay dinner.

ROMEO:
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!--
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

BALTHASAR:
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO:
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.

ROMEO:
Tush, thou art deceived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

BALTHASAR:
No, my good lord.

ROMEO:
No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!

Apothecary:
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO:
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary:
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO:
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO:
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

Apothecary:
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

ROMEO:
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

FRIAR JOHN:
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

FRIAR JOHN:
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN:
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now must I to the monument alone;
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

PARIS:
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE:

PARIS:
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

ROMEO:
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASAR:
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

ROMEO:
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR:

ROMEO:
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

PARIS:
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

ROMEO:
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

PARIS:
I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

PAGE:
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

PARIS:
O, I am slain!
If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

ROMEO:
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

BALTHASAR:
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.

BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
How long hath he been there?

BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR:
I dare not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfully did menace me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR:
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.

JULIET:
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Come, go, good Juliet,
I dare no longer stay.

JULIET:
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.
Thy lips are warm.

First Watchman:

JULIET:
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
This is thy sheath;
there rust, and let me die.

PAGE:
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

First Watchman:
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.

Second Watchman:
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

First Watchman:
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

Third Watchman:
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
As he was coming from this churchyard side.

First Watchman:
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

PRINCE:
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?

CAPULET:
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET:
The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE:
What fear is this which startles in our ears?

First Watchman:
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

First Watchman:
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With instruments upon them, fit to open
These dead men's tombs.

CAPULET:
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

LADY CAPULET:
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

PRINCE:
Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE:
Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE:
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE:
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their
true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused.

PRINCE:
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE:
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR:
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him there.

PRINCE:
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

PAGE:
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE:
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET:
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE:
But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET:
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

PRINCE:
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

WARWICK:
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.

YORK:
While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
He slily stole away and left his men:
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.

EDWARD:
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
That this is true, father, behold his blood.

MONTAGUE:
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.

RICHARD:
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.

YORK:
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?

NORFOLK:
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!

RICHARD:
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.

WARWICK:
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This is the palace of the fearful king,
And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'

YORK:
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
For hither we have broken in by force.

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.

YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.

WARWICK:
And when the king comes, offer no violence,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

YORK:
The queen this day here holds her parliament,
But little thinks we shall be of her council:
By words or blows here let us win our right.

RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.

WARWICK:
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.

YORK:
Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
I mean to take possession of my right.

WARWICK:
Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.

KING HENRY VI:
My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!

CLIFFORD:
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.

WESTMORELAND:
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.

CLIFFORD:
Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
My gracious lord, here in the parliament
Let us assail the family of York.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, know you not the city favours them,
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?

EXETER:
But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign.

YORK:
I am thine.

EXETER:
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.

YORK:
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.

EXETER:
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.

WARWICK:
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry.

CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natural king?

WARWICK:
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.

KING HENRY VI:
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?

YORK:
It must and shall be so: content thyself.

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.

WESTMORELAND:
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.

WARWICK:
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
March'd through the city to the palace gates.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.

WESTMORELAND:
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.

CLIFFORD:
Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir.

WARWICK:
Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!

YORK:
Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.

KING HENRY VI:
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and provinces.

WARWICK:
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.

KING HENRY VI:
The lord protector lost it, and not I:
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.

RICHARD:
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.

EDWARD:
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.

MONTAGUE:
Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.

RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.

YORK:
Sons, peace!

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.

WARWICK:
Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
And be you silent and attentive too,
For he that interrupts him shall not live.

KING HENRY VI:
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good, and better far than his.

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.

YORK:
'Twas by rebellion against his king.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
What then?

KING HENRY VI:
An if he may, then am I lawful king;
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.

YORK:
He rose against him, being his sovereign,
And made him to resign his crown perforce.

WARWICK:
Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?

EXETER:
No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.

KING HENRY VI:
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?

EXETER:
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.

YORK:
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?

EXETER:
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.

KING HENRY VI:

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.

WARWICK:
Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Can set the duke up in despite of me.

CLIFFORD:
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!

KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!

YORK:
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?

WARWICK:
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurping blood.

KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.

YORK:
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.

KING HENRY VI:
I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the prince your son!

WARWICK:
What good is this to England and himself!

WESTMORELAND:
Base, fearful and despairing Henry!

CLIFFORD:
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!

WESTMORELAND:
I cannot stay to hear these articles.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor I.

CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.

WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!

CLIFFORD:
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!

WARWICK:
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.

EXETER:
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!

WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it as it may: I here entail
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
And neither by treason nor hostility
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.

YORK:
This oath I willingly take and will perform.

WARWICK:
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.

KING HENRY VI:
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!

YORK:
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.

EXETER:
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!

YORK:
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.

WARWICK:
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.

NORFOLK:
And I to Norfolk with my followers.

MONTAGUE:
And I unto the sea from whence I came.

KING HENRY VI:
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.

EXETER:
Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
I'll steal away.

KING HENRY VI:
Exeter, so will I.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, you cannot disinherit me:
If you be king, why should not I succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
And given unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time?
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The duke is made protector of the realm;
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
Before I would have granted to that act.
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
Whereby my son is disinherited.
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
And utter ruin of the house of York.
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.

KING HENRY VI:
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.

KING HENRY VI:
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.

PRINCE EDWARD:
When I return with victory from the field
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.

KING HENRY VI:
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.

EXETER:
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
3 KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.

EDWARD:
No, I can better play the orator.

MONTAGUE:
But I have reasons strong and forcible.

YORK:
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
What is your quarrel? how began it first?

EDWARD:
No quarrel, but a slight contention.

YORK:
About what?

RICHARD:
About that which concerns your grace and us;
The crown of England, father, which is yours.

YORK:
Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.

RICHARD:
Your right depends not on his life or death.

EDWARD:
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
It will outrun you, father, in the end.

YORK:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.

EDWARD:
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.

RICHARD:
No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.

YORK:
I shall be, if I claim by open war.

RICHARD:
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.

YORK:
Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.

RICHARD:
An oath is of no moment, being not took
Before a true and lawful magistrate,
That hath authority over him that swears:
Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.

YORK:
Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
And tell him privily of our intent.
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
In them I trust; for they are soldiers,
Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
But that I seek occasion how to rise,
And yet the king not privy to my drift,
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?

Messenger:
The queen with all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.

YORK:
Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
My brother Montague shall post to London:
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
Whom we have left protectors of the king,
With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.

MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
The army of the queen mean to besiege us.

JOHN MORTIMER:
She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.

YORK:
What, with five thousand men?

RICHARD:
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
A woman's general; what should we fear?

EDWARD:
I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.

YORK:
Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
Many a battle have I won in France,
When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
Why should I not now have the like success?
3 KING HENRY VI

RUTLAND:
Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
As for the brat of this accursed duke,
Whose father slew my father, he shall die.

Tutor:
And I, my lord, will bear him company.

CLIFFORD:
Soldiers, away with him!

Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
Lest thou be hated both of God and man!

CLIFFORD:
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.

RUTLAND:
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
That trembles under his devouring paws;
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
And not with such a cruel threatening look.
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.

CLIFFORD:
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.

RUTLAND:
Then let my father's blood open it again:
He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.

CLIFFORD:
Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficient for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
The sight of any of the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul;
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
Therefore--

RUTLAND:
O, let me pray before I take my death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!

CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.

RUTLAND:
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
Thy father hath.

RUTLAND:
But 'twas ere I was born.
Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
And when I give occasion of offence,
Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.

CLIFFORD:
No cause!
Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.

RUTLAND:
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!

CLIFFORD:
Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.
3 KING HENRY VI

YORK:
The army of the queen hath got the field:
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
Like men born to renown by life or death.
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
The sands are number'd that make up my life;
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
And made an evening at the noontide prick.

YORK:
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon you all:
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?

CLIFFORD:
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.

YORK:
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;
And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!

CLIFFORD:
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
When he might spurn him with his foot away?
It is war's prize to take all vantages;
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So doth the cony struggle in the net.

YORK:
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would your grace have done unto him now?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
What! was it you that would be England's king?
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
And made a preachment of your high descent?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
I should lament thy miserable state.
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
And this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should not be king
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.

CLIFFORD:
That is my office, for my father's sake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abominable:
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to the septentrion.
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
Frenchwoman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.

YORK:
That face of his the hungry cannibals
Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
And I with tears do wash the blood away.
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:
My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should not for my life but weep with him.
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.

CLIFFORD:
Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.

YORK:
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
So York may overlook the town of York.
3 KING HENRY VI

EDWARD:
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
The happy tidings of his good escape.
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
I cannot joy, until I be resolved
Where our right valiant father is become.
I saw him in the battle range about;
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike father:
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
See how the morning opes her golden gates,
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!

EDWARD:
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

RICHARD:
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
Not separated with the racking clouds,
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
In this the heaven figures some event.

EDWARD:
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Each one already blazing by our meeds,
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
And over-shine the earth as this the world.
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.

RICHARD:
Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
You love the breeder better than the male.
But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?

Messenger:
Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
Your princely father and my loving lord!

EDWARD:
O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.

RICHARD:
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.

Messenger:
Environed he was with many foes,
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
And many strokes, though with a little axe,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
By many hands your father was subdued;
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
They took his head, and on the gates of York
They set the same; and there it doth remain,
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.

EDWARD:
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
For never henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O never shall I see more joy!

RICHARD:
I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
Or die renowned by attempting it.

EDWARD:
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.

RICHARD:
Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.

WARWICK:
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?

RICHARD:
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!

EDWARD:
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
I, then in London keeper of the king,
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
Bearing the king in my behalf along;
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
Or whether 'twas report of her success;
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
With promise of high pay and great rewards:
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight again.

EDWARD:
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy to England?

WARWICK:
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
And for your brother, he was lately sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.

RICHARD:
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.

WARWICK:
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.

RICHARD:
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
But in this troublous time what's to be done?
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
And of their feather many more proud birds,
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore consent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the parliament;
And now to London all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
But never once again turn back and fly.

RICHARD:
Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.

EDWARD:
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!

WARWICK:
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
The next degree is England's royal throne;
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
In every borough as we pass along;
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets, and about our task.

RICHARD:
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.

EDWARD:
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!

WARWICK:
How now! what news?

Messenger:
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
The queen is coming with a puissant host;
And craves your company for speedy counsel.

WARWICK:
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
3 KING HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.

CLIFFORD:
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child,
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.

KING HENRY VI:
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
Inferring arguments of mighty force.
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
And would my father had left me no more!
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
You promised knighthood to our forward son:
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
Edward, kneel down.

KING HENRY VI:
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.

PRINCE:
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
And in that quarrel use it to the death.

CLIFFORD:
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.

Messenger:
Royal commanders, be in readiness:
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
And in the towns, as they do march along,
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.

CLIFFORD:
I would your highness would depart the field:
The queen hath best success when you are absent.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it with resolution then to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father, cheer these noble lords
And hearten those that fight in your defence:
Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'

EDWARD:
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
And set thy diadem upon my head;
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?

EDWARD:
I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
I was adopted heir by his consent:
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
To blot out me, and put his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
And reason too:
Who should succeed the father but the son?

RICHARD:
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!

CLIFFORD:
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.

RICHARD:
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?

CLIFFORD:
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.

RICHARD:
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.

WARWICK:
What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
Your legs did better service than your hands.

WARWICK:
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.

CLIFFORD:
You said so much before, and yet you fled.

WARWICK:
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.

CLIFFORD:
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?

RICHARD:
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.

KING HENRY VI:
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.

KING HENRY VI:
I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
I am a king, and privileged to speak.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.

RICHARD:
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
By him that made us all, I am resolved
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.

EDWARD:
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.

WARWICK:
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
For York in justice puts his armour on.

PRINCE EDWARD:
If that be right which Warwick says is right,
There is no wrong, but every thing is right.

RICHARD:
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.

QUEEN MARGARET:
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.

RICHARD:
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose father bears the title of a king,--
As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
To make this shameless callet know herself.
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
By that false woman, as this king by thee.
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to his state,
He might have kept that glory to this day;
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
And we, in pity of the gentle king,
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.

GEORGE:
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping root;
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD:
And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Not willing any longer conference,
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Stay, Edward.

EDWARD:
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
I lay me down a little while to breathe;
For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.

WARWICK:
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?

GEORGE:
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?

EDWARD:
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.

RICHARD:
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.

WARWICK:
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
And look upon, as if the tragedy
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
I'll never pause again, never stand still,
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.

EDWARD:
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
That to my foes this body must be prey,
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.

RICHARD:
Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:
I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
That winter should cut off our spring-time so.

WARWICK:
Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.

GEORGE:
Yet let us all together to our troops,
And give them leave to fly that will not stay;
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
As victors wear at the Olympian games:
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
For yet is hope of life and victory.
Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.
3 KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself;
And so, have at thee!

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to the morning's war,
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
Now one the better, then another best;
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
So is the equal of this fell war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God will, there be the victory!
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
They prosper best of all when I am thence.
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
For what is in this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better than a homely swain;
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
How many make the hour full complete;
How many hours bring about the day;
How many days will finish up the year;
How many years a mortal man may live.
When this is known, then to divide the times:
So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many hours must I take my rest;
So many hours must I contemplate;
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many days my ewes have been with young;
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
Pass'd over to the end they were created,
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

Son:
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possessed with some store of crowns;
And I, that haply take them from him now,
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
O heavy times, begetting such events!
From London by the king was I press'd forth;
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
And I, who at his hands received my life, him
Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.

KING HENRY VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.

Father:
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:
For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
O, pity, God, this miserable age!
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!

KING HENRY VI:
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
The red rose and the white are on his face,
The fatal colours of our striving houses:
The one his purple blood right well resembles;
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;
If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.

Son:
How will my mother for a father's death
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!

Father:
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!

KING HENRY VI:
How will the country for these woful chances
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!

Son:
Was ever son so rued a father's death?

Father:
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?

KING HENRY VI:
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.

Son:
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.

Father:
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
And so obsequious will thy father be,
Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
For I have murdered where I should not kill.

KING HENRY VI:
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Here sits a king more woful than you are.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.

EXETER:
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
Or else come after: I'll away before.

KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!
3 KING HENRY VI

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
More than my body's parting with my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
The common people swarm like summer flies;
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy father and his father did,
Giving no ground unto the house of York,
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.

EDWARD:
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?

WARWICK:
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
For, though before his face I speak the words
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?

RICHARD:
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.

EDWARD:
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
If friend or foe, let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
But set his murdering knife unto the root
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
I mean our princely father, Duke of York.

WARWICK:
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
Instead whereof let this supply the room:
Measure for measure must be answered.

EDWARD:
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.

WARWICK:
I think his understanding is bereft.
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.

RICHARD:
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Which in the time of death he gave our father.

GEORGE:
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.

RICHARD:
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.

WARWICK:
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.

GEORGE:
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.

RICHARD:
Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.

EDWARD:
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.

GEORGE:
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?

WARWICK:
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.

RICHARD:
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
That I in all despite might rail at him,
This hand should chop it off, and with the
issuing blood
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.

WARWICK:
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
And rear it in the place your father's stands.
And now to London with triumphant march,
There to be crowned England's royal king:
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
First will I see the coronation;
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.

EDWARD:
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
And never will I undertake the thing
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

RICHARD:
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.

WARWICK:
Tut, that's a foolish observation:
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,
To see these honours in possession.
3 KING HENRY VI

First Keeper:
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
For through this laund anon the deer will come;
And in this covert will we make our stand,
Culling the principal of all the deer.

Second Keeper:
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.

First Keeper:
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.

Second Keeper:
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.

KING HENRY VI:
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
No humble suitors press to speak for right,
No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
For how can I help them, and not myself?

First Keeper:
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.

KING HENRY VI:
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
For wise men say it is the wisest course.

Second Keeper:
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.

First Keeper:
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.

KING HENRY VI:
My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
For Warwick is a subtle orator,
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
By this account then Margaret may win him;
For she's a woman to be pitied much:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
And in conclusion wins the king from her,
With promise of his sister, and what else,
To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!

Second Keeper:
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?

KING HENRY VI:
More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
A man at least, for less I should not be;
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?

Second Keeper:
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.

Second Keeper:
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?

KING HENRY VI:
My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

Second Keeper:
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us; for as we think,
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy.

KING HENRY VI:
But did you never swear, and break an oath?

Second Keeper:
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.

KING HENRY VI:
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?

Second Keeper:
Here in this country, where we now remain.

KING HENRY VI:
I was anointed king at nine months old;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?

First Keeper:
No;
For we were subjects but while you were king.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
And as the air blows it to me again,
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
And yielding to another when it blows,
Commanded always by the greater gust;
Such is the lightness of you common men.
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.

First Keeper:
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.

KING HENRY VI:
So would you be again to Henry,
If he were seated as King Edward is.

First Keeper:
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
To go with us unto the officers.

KING HENRY VI:
In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
And what God will, that let your king perform;
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

GLOUCESTER:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were dishonour to deny it her.

KING EDWARD IV:
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Widow, we will consider of your suit;
And come some other time to know our mind.

LADY GREY:
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
May it please your highness to resolve me now;
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

LADY GREY:
Three, my most gracious lord.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.

LADY GREY:
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.

KING EDWARD IV:
Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?

LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

KING EDWARD IV:
And would you not do much to do them good?

LADY GREY:
To do them good, I would sustain some harm.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.

LADY GREY:
Therefore I came unto your majesty.

KING EDWARD IV:
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.

LADY GREY:
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.

KING EDWARD IV:
What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?

LADY GREY:
What you command, that rests in me to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
But you will take exceptions to my boon.

LADY GREY:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.

LADY GREY:
Why, then I will do what your grace commands.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

LADY GREY:
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?

KING EDWARD IV:
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.

LADY GREY:
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.

LADY GREY:
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.

LADY GREY:
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?

LADY GREY:
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.

KING EDWARD IV:
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.

LADY GREY:
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.

KING EDWARD IV:
But now you partly may perceive my mind.

LADY GREY:
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.

KING EDWARD IV:
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.

LADY GREY:
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.

LADY GREY:
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
For by that loss I will not purchase them.

KING EDWARD IV:
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.

LADY GREY:
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.

LADY GREY:
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GREY:
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a sovereign.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends;
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.

LADY GREY:
And that is more than I will yield unto:
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
And yet too good to be your concubine.

KING EDWARD IV:
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.

LADY GREY:
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.

KING EDWARD IV:
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
To be the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.

GLOUCESTER:
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.

KING EDWARD IV:
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.

CLARENCE:
To whom, my lord?

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence, to myself.

GLOUCESTER:
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.

CLARENCE:
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.

GLOUCESTER:
By so much is the wonder in extremes.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.

Nobleman:
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.

KING EDWARD IV:
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
To question of his apprehension.
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
To cross me from the golden time I look for!
And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
The lustful Edward's title buried--
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
Like one that stands upon a promontory,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
Flattering me with impossibilities.
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
What other pleasure can the world afford?
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
O miserable thought! and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
To make an envious mountain on my back,
Where sits deformity to mock my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part,
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
That carries no impression like the dam.
And am I then a man to be beloved?
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
As are of better person than myself,
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
For many lives stand between me and home:
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
Seeking a way and straying from the way;
Not knowing how to find the open air,
But toiling desperately to find it out,--
Torment myself to catch the English crown:
And from that torment I will free myself,
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face to all occasions.
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
But now mischance hath trod my title down,
And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
And to my humble seat conform myself.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.

KING LEWIS XI:
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
And sit thee by our side:
Yield not thy neck
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Is of a king become a banish'd man,
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
Our people and our peers are both misled,
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.

KING LEWIS XI:
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
While we bethink a means to break it off.

QUEEN MARGARET:
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.

KING LEWIS XI:
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!

KING LEWIS XI:
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.

WARWICK:
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
And then to crave a league of amity;
And lastly, to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
To England's king in lawful marriage.

QUEEN MARGARET:

WARWICK:

QUEEN MARGARET:
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
But from deceit bred by necessity;
For how can tyrants safely govern home,
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

WARWICK:
Injurious Margaret!

PRINCE EDWARD:
And why not queen?

WARWICK:
Because thy father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.

OXFORD:
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Who by his prowess conquered all France:
From these our Henry lineally descends.

WARWICK:
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.

OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?

WARWICK:
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.

OXFORD:
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
When nature brought him to the door of death?
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.

WARWICK:
And I the house of York.

KING LEWIS XI:
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
While I use further conference with Warwick.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!

KING LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.

WARWICK:
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious in the people's eye?

WARWICK:
The more that Henry was unfortunate.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona.

WARWICK:
Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant,
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.

BONA:
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching the jointure that your king must make,
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, but not to the English king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
By this alliance to make void my suit:
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
And still is friend to him and Margaret:
But if your title to the crown be weak,
As may appear by Edward's good success,
Then 'tis but reason that I be released
From giving aid which late I promised.
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield.

WARWICK:
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
You have a father able to maintain you;
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

Post:

OXFORD:
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
I hope all's for the best.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.

WARWICK:
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.

KING LEWIS XI:
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I told your majesty as much before:
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.

WARWICK:
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
And replant Henry in his former state.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.

WARWICK:
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake to land them on our coast
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
He's very likely now to fall from him,
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
Or than for strength and safety of our country.

BONA:
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
But by thy help to this distressed queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?

BONA:
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.

WARWICK:
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.

KING LEWIS XI:
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
You shall have aid.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then, England's messenger, return in post,
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride:
Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.

BONA:
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
And I am ready to put armour on.

WARWICK:
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
There's thy reward: be gone.

KING LEWIS XI:
But, Warwick,
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?

WARWICK:
This shall assure my constant loyalty,
That if our queen and this young prince agree,
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.

WARWICK:
I came from Edward as ambassador,
But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
Had he none else to make a stale but me?
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?

CLARENCE:
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
How could he stay till Warwick made return?

SOMERSET:
My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.

GLOUCESTER:
And his well-chosen bride.

CLARENCE:
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?

CLARENCE:
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

KING EDWARD IV:
Suppose they take offence without a cause,
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
And shall have your will, because our king:
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?

GLOUCESTER:
Not I:
No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
To sunder them that yoke so well together.

KING EDWARD IV:
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
Should not become my wife and England's queen.
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
Speak freely what you think.

CLARENCE:
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.

KING EDWARD IV:
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise?

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.

HASTINGS:
Why, knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe, if true within itself?

MONTAGUE:
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.

HASTINGS:
'Tis better using France than trusting France:
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
And with their helps only defend ourselves;
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.

CLARENCE:
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
And for this once my will shall stand for law.

GLOUCESTER:
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your loving bride;
She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.

CLARENCE:
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.

KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.

CLARENCE:
In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
Which being shallow, you give me leave
To play the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
And not be tied unto his brother's will.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lords, before it pleased his majesty
To raise my state to title of a queen,
Do me but right, and you must all confess
That I was not ignoble of descent;
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
But as this title honours me and mine,
So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.

KING EDWARD IV:
My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
From France?

Post:
My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
But such as I, without your special pardon,
Dare not relate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?

Post:
At my depart, these were his very words:
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?

Post:
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'

KING EDWARD IV:
I blame not her, she could say little less;
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
For I have heard that she was there in place.

Post:
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
And I am ready to put armour on.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
But what said Warwick to these injuries?

Post:
He, more incensed against your majesty
Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
friendship
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.

CLARENCE:
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
You that love me and Warwick, follow me.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
And haste is needful in this desperate case.
Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
Go levy men, and make prepare for war;
They are already, or quickly will be landed:
Myself in person will straight follow you.
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
If it be so, then both depart to him;
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
That I may never have you in suspect.

MONTAGUE:
So God help Montague as he proves true!

HASTINGS:
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?

CLARENCE:
Fear not that, my lord.

WARWICK:
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
And but attended by a simple guard,
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
For I intend but only to surprise him.
You that will follow me to this attempt,
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:
For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
3 KING HENRY VI

First Watchman:
Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:
The king by this is set him down to sleep.

Second Watchman:
What, will he not to bed?

First Watchman:
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.

Second Watchman:
To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
If Warwick be so near as men report.

Third Watchman:
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
That with the king here resteth in his tent?

First Watchman:
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.

Third Watchman:
O, is it so? But why commands the king
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
While he himself keeps in the cold field?

Second Watchman:
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.

Third Watchman:
Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
I like it better than a dangerous honour.
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.

First Watchman:
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.

Second Watchman:
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
But to defend his person from night-foes?

WARWICK:
This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.

First Watchman:
Who goes there?

Second Watchman:
Stay, or thou diest!

SOMERSET:
What are they that fly there?

WARWICK:
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
Ay, but the case is alter'd:
When you disgraced me in my embassade,
Then I degraded you from being king,
And come now to create you Duke of York.
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
That know not how to use ambassadors,
Nor how to be contented with one wife,
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
Edward will always bear himself as king:
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.

WARWICK:
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
I'll follow you, and tell what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.

KING EDWARD IV:
What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.

OXFORD:
What now remains, my lords, for us to do
But march to London with our soldiers?

WARWICK:
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him seated in the regal throne.
3 KING HENRY VI

RIVERS:
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?

RIVERS:
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the loss of his own royal person.

RIVERS:
Then is my sovereign slain?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
And, as I further have to understand,
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.

RIVERS:
These news I must confess are full of grief;
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
And I the rather wean me from despair
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that makes me bridle passion
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.

RIVERS:
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
He hath good usage and great liberty,
And, often but attended with weak guard,
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
I have advertised him by secret means
That if about this hour he make his way
Under the colour of his usual game,
He shall here find his friends with horse and men
To set him free from his captivity.

Huntsman:
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall we then?

HASTINGS:
To Lynn, my lord,
And ship from thence to Flanders.

GLOUCESTER:
Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.

KING EDWARD IV:
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.

GLOUCESTER:
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?

Huntsman:
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
And pray that I may repossess the crown.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?

Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
But if an humble prayer may prevail,
I then crave pardon of your majesty.

KING HENRY VI:
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of household harmony
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
He was the author, thou the instrument.
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
And that the people of this blessed land
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
I here resign my government to thee,
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.

WARWICK:
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
For few men rightly temper with the stars:
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.

CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
To whom the heavens in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
As likely to be blest in peace and war;
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.

WARWICK:
And I choose Clarence only for protector.

KING HENRY VI:
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
That no dissension hinder government:
I make you both protectors of this land,
While I myself will lead a private life
And in devotion spend my latter days,
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.

WARWICK:
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?

CLARENCE:
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
For on thy fortune I repose myself.

WARWICK:
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
To Henry's body, and supply his place;
I mean, in bearing weight of government,
While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,
And all his lands and goods be confiscate.

CLARENCE:
What else? and that succession be determined.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.

KING HENRY VI:
But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat, for I command no more,
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.

CLARENCE:
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.

KING HENRY VI:
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?

SOMERSET:
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.

KING HENRY VI:
Come hither, England's hope.
If secret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.

WARWICK:
What news, my friend?

Post:
That Edward is escaped from your brother,
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?

Post:
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
In secret ambush on the forest side
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
For hunting was his daily exercise.

WARWICK:
My brother was too careless of his charge.
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
A salve for any sore that may betide.

SOMERSET:
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.

SOMERSET:
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
And says that once more I shall interchange
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
And brought desired help from Burgundy:
What then remains, we being thus arrived
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?

GLOUCESTER:
The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.

KING EDWARD IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
By fair or foul means we must enter in,
For hither will our friends repair to us.

HASTINGS:
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.

Mayor:
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.

Mayor:
True, my good lord; I know you for no less.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
As being well content with that alone.

GLOUCESTER:

HASTINGS:
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.

Mayor:
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.

GLOUCESTER:
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!

HASTINGS:
The good old man would fain that all were well,
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.

KING EDWARD IV:
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
But in the night or in the time of war.
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
For Edward will defend the town and thee,
And all those friends that deign to follow me.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.

KING EDWARD IV:
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?

MONTAGUE:
To help King Edward in his time of storm,
As every loyal subject ought to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.

MONTAGUE:
Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
What talk you of debating? in few words,
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
To keep them back that come to succor you:
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?

KING EDWARD IV:
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.

HASTINGS:
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.

GLOUCESTER:
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
And Henry but usurps the diadem.

MONTAGUE:
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
And now will I be Edward's champion.

HASTINGS:
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.

Soldier:
Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.

MONTAGUE:
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
By this I challenge him to single fight.

All:
Long live Edward the Fourth!

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this horizon,
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
And with his troops doth march amain to London;
And many giddy people flock to him.

KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and beat him back again.

CLARENCE:
A little fire is quickly trodden out;
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.

WARWICK:
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
Shall rest in London till we come to him.
Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
Farewell, my sovereign.

KING HENRY VI:
Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.

CLARENCE:
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.

KING HENRY VI:
Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!

MONTAGUE:
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.

OXFORD:
And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
And all at once, once more a happy farewell.

WARWICK:
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.

KING HENRY VI:
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine.

EXETER:
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.

KING HENRY VI:
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
I have not been desirous of their wealth,
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:
Then why should they love Edward more than me?
No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
The lamb will never cease to follow him.

EXETER:
Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?

KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
And once again proclaim us King of England.
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
Where peremptory Warwick now remains:
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
Away betimes, before his forces join,
And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?

First Messenger:
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.

WARWICK:
How far off is our brother Montague?
Where is the post that came from Montague?

Second Messenger:
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.

WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?

SOMERSET:
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
And do expect him here some two hours hence.

WARWICK:
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.

SOMERSET:
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.

WARWICK:
Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.

SOMERSET:
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.

GLOUCESTER:
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!

WARWICK:
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
That we could hear no news of his repair?

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.

GLOUCESTER:
I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
Or did he make the jest against his will?

WARWICK:
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.

WARWICK:
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.

WARWICK:
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
What is the body when the head is off?

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.

EDWARD:
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.

WARWICK:
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
And with the other fling it at thy face,
Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'

WARWICK:
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!

OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
The gates are open, let us enter too.

KING EDWARD IV:
So other foes may set upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle:
If not, the city being but of small defence,
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.

WARWICK:
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.

MONTAGUE:
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.

KING EDWARD IV:
The harder match'd, the greater victory:
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.

SOMERSET:
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.

WARWICK:
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brother's love!
Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father's house,
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.

WARWICK:
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!

KING EDWARD IV:
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?

WARWICK:
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
I will away towards Barnet presently,
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.

WARWICK:
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
That I must yield my body to the earth
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
To search the secret treasons of the world:
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
Is nothing left me but my body's length.
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
We might recover all our loss again;
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!

WARWICK:
Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
That mought not be distinguished; but at last
I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
'O, farewell, Warwick!'

WARWICK:
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.

OXFORD:
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
That will encounter with our glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.

CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it came:
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
For every cloud engenders not a storm.

GLOUCESTER:
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:
If she have time to breathe be well assured
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.

KING EDWARD IV:
We are advertised by our loving friends
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
We, having now the best at Barnet field,
Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
In every county as we go along.
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
3 KING HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
What though the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
And Montague our topmost; what of him?
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
If case some one of you would fly from us,
That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have leave to go away betimes,
Lest in our need he might infect another
And make him of like spirit to himself.
If any such be here--as God forbid!--
Let him depart before we need his help.

OXFORD:
Women and children of so high a courage,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories!

SOMERSET:
And he that will not fight for such a hope.
Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.

Messenger:
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.

OXFORD:
I thought no less: it is his policy
To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.

SOMERSET:
But he's deceived; we are in readiness.

QUEEN MARGARET:
This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.

OXFORD:
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.

KING EDWARD IV:
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.
Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.

OXFORD:
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.

SOMERSET:
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So part we sadly in this troublous world,
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward, and he his life?

GLOUCESTER:
It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!

KING EDWARD IV:
Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!

GLOUCESTER:
That you might still have worn the petticoat,
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
His currish riddles sort not with this place.

GLOUCESTER:
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.

GLOUCESTER:
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.

KING EDWARD IV:
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.

CLARENCE:
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
I am your better, traitors as ye are:
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.

KING EDWARD IV:
Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.

GLOUCESTER:
Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.

CLARENCE:
And there's for twitting me with perjury.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, kill me too!

GLOUCESTER:
Marry, and shall.

KING EDWARD IV:
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.

GLOUCESTER:
Why should she live, to fill the world with words?

KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;
I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.

CLARENCE:
What? what?

GLOUCESTER:
The Tower, the Tower.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
If this foul deed were by to equal it:
He was a man; this, in respect, a child:
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
You have no children, butchers! if you had,
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
But if you ever chance to have a child,
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:
What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.

CLARENCE:
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.

KING EDWARD IV:
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Where's Richard gone?

CLARENCE:
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.

KING EDWARD IV:
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
3 KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'

GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.

KING HENRY VI:
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.

KING HENRY VI:
The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
Have now the fatal object in my eye
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office of a fowl!
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.

KING HENRY VI:
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
Than can my ears that tragic history.
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?

GLOUCESTER:
Think'st thou I am an executioner?

KING HENRY VI:
A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
If murdering innocents be executing,
Why, then thou art an executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.

KING HENRY VI:
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
And orphans for their parents timeless death--
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
To signify thou camest to bite the world:
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
Thou camest--

GLOUCESTER:
I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!

GLOUCESTER:
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
O, may such purple tears be alway shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward:
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
And so I was; which plainly signified
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
I have no brother, I am like no brother;
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
Be resident in men like one another
And not in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
Counting myself but bad till I be best.
I'll throw thy body in another room
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.

CLARENCE:
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.

GLOUCESTER:
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now am I seated as my soul delights,
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.

CLARENCE:
What will your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.

KING EDWARD IV:
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
And now what rests but that we spend the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed--

CAMILLO:
Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
us.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters,
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note.

CAMILLO:
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be content to die?

CAMILLO:
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If the king had no son, they would desire to live
on crutches till he had one.

POLIXENES:
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
Without a burthen: time as long again
Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
And yet we should, for perpetuity,
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
That go before it.

LEONTES:
Stay your thanks a while;
And pay them when you part.

POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
To tire your royalty.

LEONTES:
We are tougher, brother,
Than you can put us to't.

POLIXENES:
No longer stay.

LEONTES:
One seven-night longer.

POLIXENES:
Very sooth, to-morrow.

LEONTES:
We'll part the time between's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES:
Press me not, beseech you, so.
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
Were there necessity in your request, although
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
Farewell, our brother.

LEONTES:
Tongue-tied, our queen?
speak you.

HERMIONE:
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
He's beat from his best ward.

LEONTES:
Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
But let him say so then, and let him go;
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
To let him there a month behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

POLIXENES:
No, madam.

HERMIONE:
Nay, but you will?

POLIXENES:
I may not, verily.

HERMIONE:
Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths,
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
One of them you shall be.

POLIXENES:
Your guest, then, madam:
To be your prisoner should import offending;
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish.

HERMIONE:
Not your gaoler, then,
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
You were pretty lordings then?

POLIXENES:
We were, fair queen,
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
And to be boy eternal.

HERMIONE:
Was not my lord
The verier wag o' the two?

POLIXENES:
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
That any did. Had we pursued that life,
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Hereditary ours.

HERMIONE:
By this we gather
You have tripp'd since.

POLIXENES:
O my most sacred lady!
Temptations have since then been born to's; for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Of my young play-fellow.

HERMIONE:
Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
With any but with us.

LEONTES:
Is he won yet?

HERMIONE:
He'll stay my lord.

LEONTES:
At my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
To better purpose.

HERMIONE:
Never?

LEONTES:
Never, but once.

HERMIONE:
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Nay, let me have't; I long.

LEONTES:
Why, that was when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
'I am yours for ever.'

HERMIONE:
'Tis grace indeed.
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
The other for some while a friend.

LEONTES:

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES:
I' fecks!
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
Yes, if you will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
To be full like me: yet they say we are
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
That will say anything but were they false
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost make possible things not so held,
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that to the infection of my brains
And hardening of my brows.

POLIXENES:
What means Sicilia?

HERMIONE:
He something seems unsettled.

POLIXENES:
How, my lord!
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?

HERMIONE:
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Are you moved, my lord?

LEONTES:
No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
Will you take eggs for money?

MAMILLIUS:
No, my lord, I'll fight.

LEONTES:
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours?

POLIXENES:
If at home, sir,
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
He makes a July's day short as December,
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood.

LEONTES:
So stands this squire
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
Apparent to my heart.

HERMIONE:
If you would seek us,
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

LEONTES:
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
Be you beneath the sky.
I am angling now,
Though you perceive me not how I give line.
Go to, go to!
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband!
Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
ears a fork'd one!
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
There have been,
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
And many a man there is, even at this present,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
As mine, against their will. Should all despair
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
No barricado for a belly; know't;
It will let in and out the enemy
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
I am like you, they say.

LEONTES:
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?

CAMILLO:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES:
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

CAMILLO:
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
When you cast out, it still came home.

LEONTES:
Didst note it?

CAMILLO:
He would not stay at your petitions: made
His business more material.

LEONTES:
Didst perceive it?
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
That he did stay?

CAMILLO:
At the good queen's entreaty.

LEONTES:
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
By any understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
But of the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.

CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Ha!

CAMILLO:
Stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Ay, but why?

CAMILLO:
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress.

LEONTES:
Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
In that which seems so.

CAMILLO:
Be it forbid, my lord!

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
From course required; or else thou must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it all for jest.

CAMILLO:
My gracious lord,
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
In every one of these no man is free,
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Where of the execution did cry out
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine.

LEONTES:
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in that man that does not think,--
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
Or else be impudently negative,
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

CAMILLO:
I would not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
You never spoke what did become you less
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that, though true.

LEONTES:
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
If this be nothing.

CAMILLO:
Good my lord, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis most dangerous.

LEONTES:
Say it be, 'tis true.

CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord.

LEONTES:
It is; you lie, you lie:
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Infected as her life, she would not live
The running of one glass.

CAMILLO:
Who does infect her?

LEONTES:
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour as their profits,
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
Which draught to me were cordial.

CAMILLO:
Sir, my lord,
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a lingering dram that should not work
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I have loved thee,--

LEONTES:
Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?

CAMILLO:
I must believe you, sir:
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.

LEONTES:
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down:
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Go then; and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
Account me not your servant.

LEONTES:
This is all:
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

CAMILLO:
I'll do't, my lord.

LEONTES:
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

CAMILLO:
O miserable lady! But, for me,
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion follows. If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Here comes Bohemia.

POLIXENES:
This is strange: methinks
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal sir!

POLIXENES:
What is the news i' the court?

CAMILLO:
None rare, my lord.

POLIXENES:
The king hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
With customary compliment; when he,
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
That changeth thus his manners.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.

POLIXENES:
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
A party in this alteration, finding
Myself thus alter'd with 't.

CAMILLO:
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
Of you that yet are well.

POLIXENES:
How! caught of me!
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
In ignorant concealment.

CAMILLO:
I may not answer.

POLIXENES:
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
Which way to be prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
Cry lost, and so good night!

POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
I am appointed him to murder you.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
By the king.

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

POLIXENES:
O, then my best blood turn
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputation to
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
That e'er was heard or read!

CAMILLO:
Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body.

POLIXENES:
How should this grow?

CAMILLO:
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
My fortunes to your service, which are here
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For, by the honour of my parents, I
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
His execution sworn.

POLIXENES:
I do believe thee:
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

HERMIONE:
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'Tis past enduring.

First Lady:
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow?

MAMILLIUS:
No, I'll none of you.

First Lady:
Why, my sweet lord?

MAMILLIUS:
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.

Second Lady:
And why so, my lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moon made with a pen.

Second Lady:
Who taught you this?

MAMILLIUS:
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?

First Lady:
Blue, my lord.

MAMILLIUS:
Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

First Lady:
Hark ye;
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
If we would have you.

Second Lady:
She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

HERMIONE:
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
And tell 's a tale.

MAMILLIUS:
Merry or sad shall't be?

HERMIONE:
As merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS:
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.

HERMIONE:
Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
There was a man--

HERMIONE:
Nay, come, sit down; then on.

MAMILLIUS:
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.

HERMIONE:
Come on, then,
And give't me in mine ear.

LEONTES:
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

First Lord:
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Even to their ships.

LEONTES:
How blest am I
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected: but if one present
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd my design, and I
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open?

First Lord:
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
On your command.

LEONTES:
I know't too well.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much blood in him.

HERMIONE:
What is this? sport?

LEONTES:
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus.

HERMIONE:
But I'ld say he had not,
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

LEONTES:
You, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
Praise her but for this her without-door form,
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She's an adulteress.

HERMIONE:
Should a villain say so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
Do but mistake.

LEONTES:
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
To this their late escape.

HERMIONE:
No, by my life.
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake.

LEONTES:
No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks.

HERMIONE:
There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The king's will be perform'd!

LEONTES:
Shall I be heard?

HERMIONE:
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

LEONTES:
Go, do our bidding; hence!

First Lord:
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.

ANTIGONUS:
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

First Lord:
For her, my lord,
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
In this which you accuse her.

ANTIGONUS:
If it prove
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

LEONTES:
Hold your peaces.

First Lord:
Good my lord,--

ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
The second and the third, nine, and some five;
If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
by mine honour,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.

LEONTES:
Cease; no more.
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
The instruments that feel.

ANTIGONUS:
If it be so,
We need no grave to bury honesty:
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES:
What! lack I credit?

First Lord:
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might.

LEONTES:
Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
We need no more of your advice: the matter,
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
Properly ours.

ANTIGONUS:
And I wish, my liege,
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
Without more overture.

LEONTES:
How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
For in an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

First Lord:
Well done, my lord.

LEONTES:
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined,
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.

ANTIGONUS:

PAULINA:
The keeper of the prison, call to him;
let him have knowledge who I am.
Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for thee;
What dost thou then in prison?
Now, good sir,
You know me, do you not?

Gaoler:
For a worthy lady
And one whom much I honour.

PAULINA:
Pray you then,
Conduct me to the queen.

Gaoler:
I may not, madam:
To the contrary I have express commandment.

PAULINA:
Here's ado,
To lock up honesty and honour from
The access of gentle visitors!
Is't lawful, pray you,
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?

Gaoler:
So please you, madam,
To put apart these your attendants, I
Shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA:
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw yourselves.

Gaoler:
And, madam,
I must be present at your conference.

PAULINA:
Well, be't so, prithee.
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
As passes colouring.
Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady?

EMILIA:
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
Which never tender lady hath born greater,
She is something before her time deliver'd.

PAULINA:
A boy?

EMILIA:
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
I am innocent as you.'

PAULINA:
I dare be sworn
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
beshrew them!
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
And never to my red-look'd anger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to the queen:
If she dares trust me with her little babe,
I'll show't the king and undertake to be
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.

EMILIA:
Most worthy madam,
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is no lady living
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
To visit the next room, I'll presently
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
Lest she should be denied.

PAULINA:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
I shall do good.

EMILIA:
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the queen: please you,
come something nearer.

Gaoler:
Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
Having no warrant.

PAULINA:
You need not fear it, sir:
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
By law and process of great nature thence
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of the king nor guilty of,
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

Gaoler:
I do believe it.

PAULINA:
Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
I will stand betwixt you and danger.

LEONTES:
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
She the adulteress; for the harlot king
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
Might come to me again. Who's there?

First Servant:
My lord?

LEONTES:
How does the boy?

First Servant:
He took good rest to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

LEONTES:
To see his nobleness!
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
See how he fares.
Fie, fie! no thought of him:
The thought of my revenges that way
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
Shall she within my power.

First Lord:
You must not enter.

PAULINA:
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
More free than he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS:
That's enough.

Second Servant:
Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
None should come at him.

PAULINA:
Not so hot, good sir:
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
At each his needless heavings, such as you
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
That presses him from sleep.

LEONTES:
What noise there, ho?

PAULINA:
No noise, my lord; but needful conference
About some gossips for your highness.

LEONTES:
How!
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged thee that she should not come about me:
I knew she would.

ANTIGONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.

LEONTES:
What, canst not rule her?

PAULINA:
From all dishonesty he can: in this,
Unless he take the course that you have done,
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
He shall not rule me.

ANTIGONUS:
La you now, you hear:
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

PAULINA:
Good my liege, I come;
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
From your good queen.

LEONTES:
Good queen!

PAULINA:
Good queen, my lord,
Good queen; I say good queen;
And would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst about you.

LEONTES:
Force her hence.

PAULINA:
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.

LEONTES:
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
A most intelligencing bawd!

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less honest
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
As this world goes, to pass for honest.

LEONTES:
Traitors!
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

PAULINA:
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.

PAULINA:
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call your children yours.

LEONTES:
A nest of traitors!

ANTIGONUS:
I am none, by this good light.

PAULINA:
Nor I, nor any
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
and will not--
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound.

LEONTES:
A callat
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
It is the issue of Polixenes:
Hence with it, and together with the dam
Commit them to the fire!

PAULINA:
It is yours;
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the print be little, the whole matter
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
His smiles,
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
Her children not her husband's!

LEONTES:
A gross hag
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
That wilt not stay her tongue.

ANTIGONUS:
Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
Hardly one subject.

LEONTES:
Once more, take her hence.

PAULINA:
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more.

LEONTES:
I'll ha' thee burnt.

PAULINA:
I care not:
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous to the world.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
If she did know me one. Away with her!

PAULINA:
I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
Jove send her
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
Will never do him good, not one of you.
So, so: farewell; we are gone.

LEONTES:
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
And see it instantly consumed with fire;
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
For thou set'st on thy wife.

ANTIGONUS:
I did not, sir:
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

Lords:
We can: my royal liege,
He is not guilty of her coming hither.

LEONTES:
You're liars all.

First Lord:
Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
We have always truly served you, and beseech you
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES:
I am a feather for each wind that blows:
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? better burn it now
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
So sure as this beard's grey,
--what will you adventure
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
Any thing, my lord,
That my ability may undergo
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent: any thing possible.

LEONTES:
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
I will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
Of any point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
Without more mercy, to its own protection
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
I swear to do this, though a present death
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

LEONTES:
No, I'll not rear
Another's issue.

Servant:
Please your highness, posts
From those you sent to the oracle are come
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
Hasting to the court.

First Lord:
So please you, sir, their speed
Hath been beyond account.

LEONTES:
Twenty-three days
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
Summon a session, that we may arraign
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
Been publicly accused, so shall she have
A just and open trial. While she lives
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
And think upon my bidding.

CLEOMENES:
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.

DION:
I shall report,
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
It was i' the offering!

CLEOMENES:
But of all, the burst
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
That I was nothing.

DION:
If the event o' the journey
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
The time is worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
Great Apollo
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I little like.

DION:
The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contents discover, something rare
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
And gracious be the issue!

LEONTES:
This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Produce the prisoner.

Officer:
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
Appear in person here in court. Silence!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.

Officer:

HERMIONE:
Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honour, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!

LEONTES:
I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first.

HERMIONE:
That's true enough;
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

LEONTES:
You will not own it.

HERMIONE:
More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom I am accused, I do confess
I loved him as in honour he required,
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me, with a love even such,
So and no other, as yourself commanded:
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
For me to try how: all I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

LEONTES:
You knew of his departure, as you know
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak a language that I understand not:
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
Your actions are my dreams;
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death.

HERMIONE:
Sir, spare your threats:
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
But know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
Haled out to murder: myself on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
I do refer me to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!

First Lord:
This your request
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
And in Apollos name, his oracle.

HERMIONE:
The Emperor of Russia was my father:
O that he were alive, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge!

Officer:
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
You have not dared to break the holy seal
Nor read the secrets in't.

CLEOMENES:
All this we swear.

LEONTES:
Break up the seals and read.

Officer:

Lords:
Now blessed be the great Apollo!

HERMIONE:
Praised!

LEONTES:
Hast thou read truth?

Officer:
Ay, my lord; even so
As it is here set down.

LEONTES:
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.

Servant:
My lord the king, the king!

LEONTES:
What is the business?

Servant:
O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
Of the queen's speed, is gone.

LEONTES:
How! gone!

Servant:
Is dead.

LEONTES:
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.
How now there!

PAULINA:
This news is mortal to the queen: look down
And see what death is doing.

LEONTES:
Take her hence:
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.
Apollo, pardon
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
For, being transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him,
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
Of all encertainties himself commended,
No richer than his honour: how he glisters
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Does my deeds make the blacker!

PAULINA:
Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too.

First Lord:
What fit is this, good lady?

PAULINA:
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or little; though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
and vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

First Lord:
The higher powers forbid!

PAULINA:
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

LEONTES:
Go on, go on
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest.

First Lord:
Say no more:
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
I' the boldness of your speech.

PAULINA:
I am sorry for't:
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
I'll not remember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
And I'll say nothing.

LEONTES:
Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth; which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of their death appear, unto
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
Unto these sorrows.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

Mariner:
Ay, my lord: and fear
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
And frown upon 's.

ANTIGONUS:
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.

Mariner:
Make your best haste, and go not
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
Of prey that keep upon't.

ANTIGONUS:
Go thou away:
I'll follow instantly.

Mariner:
I am glad at heart
To be so rid o' the business.

ANTIGONUS:
Come, poor babe:
I have heard, but not believed,
the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and there thy character: there these;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
I am gone for ever.

Shepherd:
I would there were no age between sixteen and
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
rest; for there is nothing in the between but
getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
though I am not bookish, yet I can read
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

Clown:
Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd:
What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
ailest thou, man?

Clown:
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
a bodkin's point.

Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is it?

Clown:
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And then for the
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
the sea or weather.

Shepherd:
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
now.

Shepherd:
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

Clown:
I would you had been by the ship side, to have
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
open't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!

Shepherd:
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
boy, the next way home.

Clown:
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
it.

Shepherd:
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
sight of him.

Clown:
Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

Shepherd:
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

Time:
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage, that I slide
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
Or what is now received: I witness to
The times that brought them in; so shall I do
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
The glistering of this present, as my tale
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators, that I now may be
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
I now name to you; and with speed so pace
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
Be known when 'tis brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter,
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
If never, yet that Time himself doth say
He wishes earnestly you never may.

POLIXENES:
I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
grant this.

CAMILLO:
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
think so, which is another spur to my departure.

POLIXENES:
As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
made me businesses which none without thee can
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
them thyself or take away with thee the very
services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
being gracious, than they are in losing them when
they have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
from court and is less frequent to his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

POLIXENES:
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.

CAMILLO:
I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.

POLIXENES:
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
appearing what we are, have some question with the
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I willingly obey your command.

POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

AUTOLYCUS:
When daffodils begin to peer,
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
The pale moon shines by night:
And when I wander here and there,
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have leave to live,
And bear the sow-skin budget,
Then my account I well may, give,
And in the stocks avouch it.
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
of it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
shorn. what comes the wool to?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever I was born!

Clown:
I' the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS:
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
then, death, death!

Clown:
Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee, rather than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
ones and millions.

Clown:
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
great matter.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
me.

Clown:
What, by a horseman, or a footman?

AUTOLYCUS:
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

Clown:
Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alas, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out.

Clown:
How now! canst stand?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
that kills my heart.

Clown:
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown:
His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
there; and yet it will no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS:
Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

Clown:
Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
put me into this apparel.

Clown:
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
him.

Clown:
How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS:
Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
softly towards my kinsman's.

Clown:
Shall I bring thee on the way?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

Clown:
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper you, sweet sir!
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
make not this cheat bring out another and the
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
put in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
And merrily hent the stile-a:
A merry heart goes all the day,
Your sad tires in a mile-a.

FLORIZEL:
These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
And you the queen on't.

PERDITA:
Sir, my gracious lord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
To show myself a glass.

FLORIZEL:
I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
Thy father's ground.

PERDITA:
Now Jove afford you cause!
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
To think your father, by some accident,
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would he look, to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of his presence?

FLORIZEL:
Apprehend
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Humbling their deities to love, have taken
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem now. Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
Burn hotter than my faith.

PERDITA:
O, but, sir,
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
One of these two must be necessities,
Which then will speak, that you must
change this purpose,
Or I my life.

FLORIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita,
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
Of celebration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come.

PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
Stand you auspicious!

FLORIZEL:
See, your guests approach:
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And let's be red with mirth.

Shepherd:
Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
She would to each one sip. You are retired,
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
A way to make us better friends, more known.
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
As your good flock shall prosper.

PERDITA:

POLIXENES:
Shepherdess,
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
With flowers of winter.

PERDITA:
Sir, the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
Of trembling winter, the fairest
flowers o' the season
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
To get slips of them.

POLIXENES:
Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them?

PERDITA:
For I have heard it said
There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating nature.

POLIXENES:
Say there be;
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
Which you say adds to nature, is an art
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race: this is an art
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
The art itself is nature.

PERDITA:
So it is.

POLIXENES:
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
And do not call them bastards.

PERDITA:
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than were I painted I would wish
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

CAMILLO:
I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing.

PERDITA:
Out, alas!
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through.
Now, my fair'st friend,
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL:
What, like a corse?

PERDITA:
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition.

FLORIZEL:
What you do
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, still so,
And own no other function: each your doing,
So singular in each particular,
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts are queens.

PERDITA:
O Doricles,
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
You woo'd me the false way.

FLORIZEL:
I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
That never mean to part.

PERDITA:
I'll swear for 'em.

POLIXENES:
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
But smacks of something greater than herself,
Too noble for this place.

CAMILLO:
He tells her something
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
The queen of curds and cream.

Clown:
Come on, strike up!

DORCAS:
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
To mend her kissing with!

MOPSA:
Now, in good time!

Clown:
Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Come, strike up!

POLIXENES:
Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
Which dances with your daughter?

Shepherd:
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe it;
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
I think so too; for never gazed the moon
Upon the water as he'll stand and read
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best.

POLIXENES:
She dances featly.

Shepherd:
So she does any thing; though I report it,
That should be silent: if young Doricles
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Which he not dreams of.

Servant:
O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
ears grew to his tunes.

Clown:
He could never come better; he shall come in. I
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably.

Servant:
He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'

POLIXENES:
This is a brave fellow.

Clown:
Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?

Servant:
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.

Clown:
Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.

PERDITA:
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

Clown:
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
than you'ld think, sister.

PERDITA:
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

AUTOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
What maids lack from head to heel:
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.

Clown:
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.

MOPSA:
I was promised them against the feast; but they come
not too late now.

DORCAS:
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.

MOPSA:
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.

Clown:
Is there no manners left among maids? will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
your tongues, and not a word more.

MOPSA:
I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
and a pair of sweet gloves.

Clown:
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown:
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.

AUTOLYCUS:
I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.

Clown:
What hast here? ballads?

MOPSA:
Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
life, for then we are sure they are true.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA:
Is it true, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a month old.

DORCAS:
Bless me from marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?

MOPSA:
Pray you now, buy it.

Clown:
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.

DORCAS:
Is it true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
my pack will hold.

Clown:
Lay it by too: another.

AUTOLYCUS:
This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.

MOPSA:
Let's have some merry ones.

AUTOLYCUS:
Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
request, I can tell you.

MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.

DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know.

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
O, whither?

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
It becomes thy oath full well,
Thou to me thy secrets tell.

DORCAS:
Me too, let me go thither.

MOPSA:
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.

DORCAS:
If to either, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast sworn my love to be.

MOPSA:
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Then whither goest? say, whither?

Clown:
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
have the first choice. Follow me, girls.

AUTOLYCUS:
And you shall pay well for 'em.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Come to the pedlar;
Money's a medler.
That doth utter all men's ware-a.

Servant:
Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
be not too rough for some that know little but
bowling, it will please plentifully.

Shepherd:
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

POLIXENES:
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
these four threes of herdsmen.

Servant:
One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
danced before the king; and not the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.

Shepherd:
Leave your prating: since these good men are
pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.

Servant:
Why, they stay at door, sir.

POLIXENES:
O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
He's simple and tells much.
How now, fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
And handed love as you do, I was wont
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
To her acceptance; you have let him go
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
For a reply, at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her.

FLORIZEL:
Old sir, I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my heart; which I have given already,
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts twice o'er.

POLIXENES:
What follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
But to your protestation; let me hear
What you profess.

FLORIZEL:
Do, and be witness to 't.

POLIXENES:
And this my neighbour too?

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
Without her love; for her employ them all;
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.

POLIXENES:
Fairly offer'd.

CAMILLO:
This shows a sound affection.

Shepherd:
But, my daughter,
Say you the like to him?

PERDITA:
I cannot speak
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.

Shepherd:
Take hands, a bargain!
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
I give my daughter to him, and will make
Her portion equal his.

FLORIZEL:
O, that must be
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us 'fore these witnesses.

Shepherd:
Come, your hand;
And, daughter, yours.

POLIXENES:
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
Have you a father?

FLORIZEL:
I have: but what of him?

POLIXENES:
Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL:
He neither does nor shall.

POLIXENES:
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
Is not your father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
But what he did being childish?

FLORIZEL:
No, good sir;
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age.

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
The father, all whose joy is nothing else
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
In such a business.

FLORIZEL:
I yield all this;
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business.

POLIXENES:
Let him know't.

FLORIZEL:
He shall not.

POLIXENES:
Prithee, let him.

FLORIZEL:
No, he must not.

Shepherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice.

FLORIZEL:
Come, come, he must not.
Mark our contract.

POLIXENES:
Mark your divorce, young sir,
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
The royal fool thou copest with,--

Shepherd:
O, my heart!

POLIXENES:
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open,
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
As thou art tender to't.

PERDITA:
Even here undone!
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
But milk my ewes and weep.

CAMILLO:
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest.

Shepherd:
I cannot speak, nor think
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
You have undone a man of fourscore three,
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the bed my father died,
To lie close by his honest bones: but now
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
That knew'st this was the prince,
and wouldst adventure
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
To die when I desire.

FLORIZEL:
Why look you so upon me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
More straining on for plucking back, not following
My leash unwillingly.

CAMILLO:
Gracious my lord,
You know your father's temper: at this time
He will allow no speech, which I do guess
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
Come not before him.

FLORIZEL:
I not purpose it.
I think, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
Even he, my lord.

PERDITA:
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

FLORIZEL:
It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith; and then
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
From my succession wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affection.

CAMILLO:
Be advised.

FLORIZEL:
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
Do bid it welcome.

CAMILLO:
This is desperate, sir.

FLORIZEL:
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
Tug for the time to come. This you may know
And so deliver, I am put to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
Concern me the reporting.

CAMILLO:
O my lord!
I would your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZEL:
Hark, Perdita
I'll hear you by and by.

CAMILLO:
He's irremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see.

FLORIZEL:
Now, good Camillo;
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
That I have borne your father?

FLORIZEL:
Very nobly
Have you deserved: it is my father's music
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To have them recompensed as thought on.

CAMILLO:
Well, my lord,
If you may please to think I love the king
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
As shall become your highness; where you may
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL:
How, Camillo,
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
That I may call thee something more than man
And after that trust to thee.

CAMILLO:
Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL:
Not any yet:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.

CAMILLO:
Then list to me:
This follows, if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself and your fair princess,
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

FLORIZEL:
Worthy Camillo,
What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him?

CAMILLO:
Sent by the king your father
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you as from your father shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say; that he shall not perceive
But that you have your father's bosom there
And speak his very heart.

FLORIZEL:
I am bound to you:
There is some sap in this.

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office, if they can but stay you
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

PERDITA:
One of these is true:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take in the mind.

CAMILLO:
Yea, say you so?
There shall not at your father's house these
seven years
Be born another such.

FLORIZEL:
My good Camillo,
She is as forward of her breeding as
She is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
I cannot say 'tis pity
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
To most that teach.

PERDITA:
Your pardon, sir; for this
I'll blush you thanks.

FLORIZEL:
My prettiest Perdita!
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
That you may know you shall not want, one word.

AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had not the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the whole army.

CAMILLO:
Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

FLORIZEL:
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--

CAMILLO:
Shall satisfy your father.

PERDITA:
Happy be you!
All that you speak shows fair.

CAMILLO:
Who have we here?
We'll make an instrument of this, omit
Nothing may give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.

CAMILLO:
How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.

CAMILLO:
Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
change garments with this gentleman: though the
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
there's some boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough.

CAMILLO:
Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
flayed already.

AUTOLYCUS:
Are you in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick on't.

FLORIZEL:
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
conscience take it.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.

PERDITA:
I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part.

CAMILLO:
No remedy.
Have you done there?

FLORIZEL:
Should I now meet my father,
He would not call me son.

CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.

FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.

CAMILLO:

FLORIZEL:
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

CAMILLO:
The swifter speed the better.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
and therein am I constant to my profession.
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clown:
See, see; what a man you are now!
There is no other way but to tell the king
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd:
Nay, but hear me.

Clown:
Nay, but hear me.

Shepherd:
Go to, then.

Clown:
She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
and blood has not offended the king; and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
those things you found about her, those secret
things, all but what she has with her: this being
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.

Shepherd:
I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
me the king's brother-in-law.

Clown:
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by I know how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
fardel will make him scratch his beard.

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Pray heartily he be at palace.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
To the palace, an it like your worship.

AUTOLYCUS:
Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

Clown:
We are but plain fellows, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
they do not give us the lie.

Clown:
Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
had not taken yourself with the manner.

Shepherd:
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
open thy affair.

Shepherd:
My business, sir, is to the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
What advocate hast thou to him?

Shepherd:
I know not, an't like you.

Clown:
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
have none.

Shepherd:
None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.

AUTOLYCUS:
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me as these are,
Therefore I will not disdain.

Clown:
This cannot be but a great courtier.

Shepherd:
His garments are rich, but he wears
them not handsomely.

Clown:
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
on's teeth.

AUTOLYCUS:
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?

Shepherd:
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
which none must know but the king; and which he
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
speech of him.

AUTOLYCUS:
Age, thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
Why, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
know the king is full of grief.

Shepard:
So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
married a shepherd's daughter.

AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.

Clown:
Think you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

Clown:
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead; then recovered again with
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their offences being so
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
men, what you have to the king: being something
gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
shall do it.

Clown:
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd:
An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done what I promised?

Shepherd:
Ay, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?

Clown:
In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be made an example.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
pawn till it be brought you.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
hedge and follow you.

Clown:
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd:
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.

AUTOLYCUS:
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
officious; for I am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
them: there may be matter in it.

CLEOMENES:
Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
With them forgive yourself.

LEONTES:
Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
My blemishes in them, and so still think of
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Bred his hopes out of.

PAULINA:
True, too true, my lord:
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
Or from the all that are took something good,
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
Would be unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
I think so. Kill'd!
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
Say so but seldom.

CLEOMENES:
Not at all, good lady:
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Have done the time more benefit and graced
Your kindness better.

PAULINA:
You are one of those
Would have him wed again.

DION:
If you would not so,
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
Of his most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow to't?

PAULINA:
There is none worthy,
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
For has not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come again to me; who, on my life,
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
Oppose against their wills.
Care not for issue;
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Was like to be the best.

LEONTES:
Good Paulina,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
I know, in honour, O, that ever I
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips--

PAULINA:
And left them
More rich for what they yielded.

LEONTES:
Thou speak'st truth.
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?'

PAULINA:
Had she such power,
She had just cause.

LEONTES:
She had; and would incense me
To murder her I married.

PAULINA:
I should so.
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should be 'Remember mine.'

LEONTES:
Stars, stars,
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
I'll have no wife, Paulina.

PAULINA:
Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?

LEONTES:
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

PAULINA:
Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

CLEOMENES:
You tempt him over-much.

PAULINA:
Unless another,
As like Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES:
Good madam,--

PAULINA:
I have done.
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
As was your former; but she shall be such
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
it should take joy
To see her in your arms.

LEONTES:
My true Paulina,
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.

PAULINA:
That
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Never till then.

Gentleman:
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
To your high presence.

LEONTES:
What with him? he comes not
Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
By need and accident. What train?

Gentleman:
But few,
And those but mean.

LEONTES:
His princess, say you, with him?

Gentleman:
Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
That e'er the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA:
O Hermione,
As every present time doth boast itself
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
Have said and writ so, but your writing now
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you have seen a better.

Gentleman:
Pardon, madam:
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of all professors else, make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow.

PAULINA:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
Women will love her, that she is a woman
More worth than any man; men, that she is
The rarest of all women.

LEONTES:
Go, Cleomenes;
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
He thus should steal upon us.

PAULINA:
Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Between their births.

LEONTES:
Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
Will bring me to consider that which may
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
For she did print your royal father off,
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
Your father's image is so hit in you,
His very air, that I should call you brother,
As I did him, and speak of something wildly
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
All mine own folly--the society,
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
Though bearing misery, I desire my life
Once more to look on him.

FLORIZEL:
By his command
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
His wish'd ability, he had himself
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
And those that bear them living.

LEONTES:
O my brother,
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
The adventure of her person?

FLORIZEL:
Good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL:
Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your highness: my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival and my wife's in safety
Here where we are.

LEONTES:
The blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father,
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
For which the heavens, taking angry note,
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
As he from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
Such goodly things as you!

Lord:
Most noble sir,
That which I shall report will bear no credit,
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
Desires you to attach his son, who has--
His dignity and duty both cast off--
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
A shepherd's daughter.

LEONTES:
Where's Bohemia? speak.

Lord:
Here in your city; I now came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
My marvel and my message. To your court
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother, having both their country quitted
With this young prince.

FLORIZEL:
Camillo has betray'd me;
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers.

Lord:
Lay't so to his charge:
He's with the king your father.

LEONTES:
Who? Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
With divers deaths in death.

PERDITA:
O my poor father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
Our contract celebrated.

LEONTES:
You are married?

FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
The odds for high and low's alike.

LEONTES:
My lord,
Is this the daughter of a king?

FLORIZEL:
She is,
When once she is my wife.

LEONTES:
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
That you might well enjoy her.

FLORIZEL:
Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
Step forth mine advocate; at your request
My father will grant precious things as trifles.

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Which he counts but a trifle.

PAULINA:
Sir, my liege,
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
Than what you look on now.

LEONTES:
I thought of her,
Even in these looks I made.
But your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
I now go toward him; therefore follow me
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?

First Gentleman:
I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
heard the shepherd say, he found the child.

AUTOLYCUS:
I would most gladly know the issue of it.

First Gentleman:
I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
extremity of the one, it must needs be.
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
The news, Rogero?

Second Gentleman:
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
cannot be able to express it.
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
which is called true is so like an old tale, that
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
found his heir?

Third Gentleman:
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character, the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the two kings?

Second Gentleman:
No.

Third Gentleman:
Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
holding up of hands, with countenances of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
another encounter, which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it.

Second Gentleman:
What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
hence the child?

Third Gentleman:
Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.

First Gentleman:
What became of his bark and his followers?

Third Gentleman:
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
of losing.

First Gentleman:
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.

Third Gentleman:
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
confessed and lamented by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.

First Gentleman:
Are they returned to the court?

Third Gentleman:
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work, would
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
answer: thither with all greediness of affection
are they gone, and there they intend to sup.

Second Gentleman:
I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Let's along.

AUTOLYCUS:
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
so he then took her to be, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
weather continuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
been the finder out of this secret, it would not
have relished among my other discredits.
Here come those I have done good to against my will,
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

Shepherd:
Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
daughters will be all gentlemen born.

Clown:
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

AUTOLYCUS:
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

Clown:
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

Shepherd:
And so have I, boy.

Clown:
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
called me brother; and then the two kings called my
father brother; and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
tears that ever we shed.

Shepherd:
We may live, son, to shed many more.

Clown:
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS:
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master.

Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
gentlemen.

Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy life?

AUTOLYCUS:
Ay, an it like your good worship.

Clown:
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

Shepherd:
You may say it, but not swear it.

Clown:
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
franklins say it, I'll swear it.

Shepherd:
How if it be false, son?

Clown:
If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will prove so, sir, to my power.

Clown:
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
good masters.

LEONTES:
O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
That I have had of thee!

PAULINA:
What, sovereign sir,
I did not well I meant well. All my services
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
It is a surplus of your grace, which never
My life may last to answer.

LEONTES:
O Paulina,
We honour you with trouble: but we came
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
Have we pass'd through, not without much content
In many singularities; but we saw not
That which my daughter came to look upon,
The statue of her mother.

PAULINA:
As she lived peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
I like your silence, it the more shows off
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
Comes it not something near?

LEONTES:
Her natural posture!
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seems.

POLIXENES:
O, not by much.

PAULINA:
So much the more our carver's excellence;
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
As she lived now.

LEONTES:
As now she might have done,
So much to my good comfort, as it is
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
There's magic in thy majesty, which has
My evils conjured to remembrance and
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
Standing like stone with thee.

PERDITA:
And give me leave,
And do not say 'tis superstition, that
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

PAULINA:
O, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.

CAMILLO:
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner.

POLIXENES:
Dear my brother,
Let him that was the cause of this have power
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself.

PAULINA:
Indeed, my lord,
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
I'ld not have show'd it.

LEONTES:
Do not draw the curtain.

PAULINA:
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
May think anon it moves.

LEONTES:
Let be, let be.
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Did verily bear blood?

POLIXENES:
Masterly done:
The very life seems warm upon her lip.

LEONTES:
The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
As we are mock'd with art.

PAULINA:
I'll draw the curtain:
My lord's almost so far transported that
He'll think anon it lives.

LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years together!
No settled senses of the world can match
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
I could afflict you farther.

LEONTES:
Do, Paulina;
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
For I will kiss her.

PAULINA:
Good my lord, forbear:
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

LEONTES:
No, not these twenty years.

PERDITA:
So long could I
Stand by, a looker on.

PAULINA:
Either forbear,
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
Which I protest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

LEONTES:
What you can make her do,
I am content to look on: what to speak,
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
To make her speak as move.

PAULINA:
It is required
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
On: those that think it is unlawful business
I am about, let them depart.

LEONTES:
Proceed:
No foot shall stir.

PAULINA:
Music, awake her; strike!
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
Start not; her actions shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Until you see her die again; for then
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
Is she become the suitor?

LEONTES:
O, she's warm!
If this be magic, let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

POLIXENES:
She embraces him.

CAMILLO:
She hangs about his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Or how stolen from the dead.

PAULINA:
That she is living,
Were it but told you, should be hooted at
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
Our Perdita is found.

HERMIONE:
You gods, look down
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
Myself to see the issue.

PAULINA:
There's time enough for that;
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like relation. Go together,
You precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
My mate, that's never to be found again,
Lament till I am lost.

LEONTES:
O, peace, Paulina!
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
Is richly noted and here justified
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
That e'er I put between your holy looks
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
Each one demand an answer to his part
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESCALUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practise hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it?

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look where he comes.

ANGELO:
Always obedient to your grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.

ANGELO:
Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Through it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO:
The heavens give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS:
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

DUKE:
I thank you. Fare you well.

ESCALUS:
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.

ANGELO:
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

ESCALUS:
I'll wait upon your honour.

LUCIO:
If the duke with the other dukes come not to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
the dukes fall upon the king.

First Gentleman:
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Hungary's!

Second Gentleman:
Amen.

LUCIO:
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table.

Second Gentleman:
'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO:
Ay, that he razed.

First Gentleman:
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
all the rest from their functions: they put forth
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
well that prays for peace.

Second Gentleman:
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO:
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
grace was said.

Second Gentleman:
No? a dozen times at least.

First Gentleman:
What, in metre?

LUCIO:
In any proportion or in any language.

First Gentleman:
I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO:
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
wicked villain, despite of all grace.

First Gentleman:
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may between the lists and the
velvet. Thou art the list.

First Gentleman:
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
feelingly now?

LUCIO:
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
live, forget to drink after thee.

First Gentleman:
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

Second Gentleman:
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.

LUCIO:
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--

Second Gentleman:
To what, I pray?

LUCIO:
Judge.

Second Gentleman:
To three thousand dolours a year.

First Gentleman:
Ay, and more.

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Gentleman:
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO:
Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.

First Gentleman:
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

Second Gentleman:
Who's that, I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

First Gentleman:
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away; and, which is more, within these
three days his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO:
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
Art thou sure of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.

LUCIO:
Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
hours since, and he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Gentleman:
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.

First Gentleman:
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

LUCIO:
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
custom-shrunk.
How now! what's the news with you?

POMPEY:
Yonder man is carried to prison.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well; what has he done?

POMPEY:
A woman.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But what's his offence?

POMPEY:
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What, is there a maid with child by him?

POMPEY:
No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
not heard of the proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What proclamation, man?

POMPEY:
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
And what shall become of those in the city?

POMPEY:
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
but that a wise burgher put in for them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulled down?

POMPEY:
To the ground, mistress.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?

POMPEY:
Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
clients: though you change your place, you need not
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
will be considered.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY:
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
prison; and there's Madam Juliet.

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

Provost:
I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

LUCIO:
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

CLAUDIO:
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO:
If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
What but to speak of would offend again.

LUCIO:
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO:
No.

LUCIO:
Lechery?

CLAUDIO:
Call it so.

Provost:
Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIO:
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO:
A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

CLAUDIO:
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his emmence that fills it up,
I stagger in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

LUCIO:
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
him.

CLAUDIO:
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

LUCIO:
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
like, which else would stand under grievous
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO:
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO:
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace speak of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?

FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS:
It rested in your grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

ISABELLA:
And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA:
Are not these large enough?

ISABELLA:
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Who's that which calls?

FRANCISCA:
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress:
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls

LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?

ISABELLA:
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister.

LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

ISABELLA:
Woe me! for what?

LUCIO:
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.

ISABELLA:
Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO:
It is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

ISABELLA:
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO:
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA:
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO:
Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA:
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO:
She it is.

ISABELLA:
O, let him marry her.

LUCIO:
This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

ISABELLA:
Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO:
Has censured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execution.

ISABELLA:
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?

LUCIO:
Assay the power you have.

ISABELLA:
My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA:
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO:
But speedily.

ISABELLA:
I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

LUCIO:
I take my leave of you.

ISABELLA:
Good sir, adieu.

ANGELO:
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO:
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS:
Be it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO:
Where is the provost?

Provost:
Here, if it like your honour.

ANGELO:
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:

ELBOW:
Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
common houses, I know no law: bring them away.

ANGELO:
How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?

ELBOW:
If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO:
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
they not malefactors?

ELBOW:
If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
of; and void of all profanation in the world that
good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS:
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO:
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY:
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO:
What are you, sir?

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
How know you that?

ELBOW:
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS:
How? thy wife?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS:
Dost thou detest her therefore?

ELBOW:
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS:
How dost thou know that, constable?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been accused in
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
spit in his face, so she defied him.

POMPEY:
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW:
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
man; prove it.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear how he misplaces?

POMPEY:
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
good dishes,--

ESCALUS:
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

POMPEY:
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
the right: but to the point. As I say, this
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
not give you three-pence again.

FROTH:
No, indeed.

POMPEY:
Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--

FROTH:
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY:
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
good diet, as I told you,--

FROTH:
All this is true.

POMPEY:
Why, very well, then,--

ESCALUS:
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
complain of? Come me to what was done to her.

POMPEY:
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS:
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY:
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
Master Froth?

FROTH:
All-hallond eve.

POMPEY:
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
to sit, have you not?

FROTH:
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.

POMPEY:
Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO:
This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS:
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?

POMPEY:
Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW:
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY:
I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS:
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY:
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS:
Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY:
Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS:
Well, I do so.

POMPEY:
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS:
Why, no.

POMPEY:
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
your honour.

ESCALUS:
He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?

ELBOW:
First, an it like you, the house is a respected
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
mistress is a respected woman.

POMPEY:
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
person than any of us all.

ELBOW:
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
time has yet to come that she was ever respected
with man, woman, or child.

POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

ESCALUS:
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?

ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
with me, let not your worship think me the poor
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
action of slander too.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
are.

ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS:
Where were you born, friend?

FROTH:
Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH:
Yes, an't please you, sir.

ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY:
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS:
Your mistress' name?

POMPHEY:
Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS:
Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY:
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS:
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
more of you.

FROTH:
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
in.

ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
name, Master tapster?

POMPEY:
Pompey.

ESCALUS:
What else?

POMPEY:
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS:
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY:
If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS:
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY:
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
youth of the city?

ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
If your worship will take order for the drabs and
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.

ESCALUS:
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
it is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY:
If you head and hang all that offend that way but
for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
commission for more heads: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
come to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS:
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY:
I thank your worship for your good counsel:
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.

ESCALUS:
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW:
Seven year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?

ELBOW:
And a half, sir.

ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
in your ward sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
do it for some piece of money, and go through with
all.

ESCALUS:
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
the most sufficient of your parish.

ELBOW:
To your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS:
To my house. Fare you well.
What's o'clock, think you?

Justice:
Eleven, sir.

ESCALUS:
I pray you home to dinner with me.

Justice:
I humbly thank you.

ESCALUS:
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.

Justice:
Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.

Servant:
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
I'll tell him of you.

Provost:
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!

ANGELO:
Now, what's the matter. Provost?

Provost:
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

ANGELO:
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?

Provost:
Lest I might be too rash:
Under your good correction, I have seen,
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.

ANGELO:
Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well be spared.

Provost:
I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.

ANGELO:
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.

Servant:
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you.

ANGELO:
Hath he a sister?

Provost:
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.

ANGELO:
Well, let her be admitted.
See you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
There shall be order for't.

Provost:
God save your honour!

ANGELO:
Stay a little while.
You're welcome: what's your will?

ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me.

ANGELO:
Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA:
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO:
Well; the matter?

ISABELLA:
I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.

Provost:

ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?

ANGELO:
Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA:
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO:
I will not do't.

ISABELLA:
But can you, if you would?

ANGELO:
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ISABELLA:
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?

ANGELO:
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you and you as he,
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO:
Pray you, be gone.

ISABELLA:
I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
And what a prisoner.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.

ANGELO:
Be you content, fair maid;
It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But, ere they live, to end.

ISABELLA:
Yet show some pity.

ANGELO:
I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA:
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO:

Provost:

ISABELLA:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO:
Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.

ISABELLA:
That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA:
Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
How! bribe me?

ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
Well; come to me to-morrow.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Heaven keep your honour safe!

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO:
At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA:
'Save your honour!

ANGELO:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Even till now,
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.

Provost:
I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.

Provost:
I would do more than that, if more were needful.
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
More fit to do another such offence
Than die for this.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

Provost:
As I do think, to-morrow.
I have provided for you: stay awhile,
And you shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

JULIET:
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put on.

JULIET:
I'll gladly learn.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love you the man that wrong'd you?

JULIET:
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?

JULIET:
Mutually.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

JULIET:
I do confess it, and repent it, father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear,--

JULIET:
I do repent me, as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite!

JULIET:
Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

Provost:
'Tis pity of him.

ANGELO:
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name;
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
Is like a good thing, being often read,
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
'Tis not the devil's crest.
How now! who's there?

Servant:
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO:
Teach her the way.
O heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive: and even so
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
How now, fair maid?

ISABELLA:
I am come to know your pleasure.

ANGELO:
That you might know it, would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die.

ISABELLA:
Under your sentence?

ANGELO:
Yea.

ISABELLA:
When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO:
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

ISABELLA:
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

ANGELO:
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO:
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA:
How say you?

ANGELO:
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?

ISABELLA:
Please you to do't,
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA:
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.

ANGELO:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA:
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA:
So.

ANGELO:
And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA:
True.

ANGELO:
Admit no other way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
What would you do?

ISABELLA:
As much for my poor brother as myself:
That is, were I under the terms of death,
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
My body up to shame.

ANGELO:
Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA:
And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once,
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.

ANGELO:
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO:
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.

ISABELLA:
O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate,
For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO:
We are all frail.

ISABELLA:
Else let my brother die,
If not a feodary, but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO:
Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA:
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
I think it well:
And from this testimony of your own sex,--
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now,
By putting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Let me entreat you speak the former language.

ANGELO:
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA:
My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for it.

ANGELO:
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA:
I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.

ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose.

ISABELLA:
Ha! little honour to be much believed,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.

ANGELO:
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation overweigh,
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA:
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

ISABELLA:

Provost:
Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.

ISABELLA:
My business is a word or two with Claudio.

Provost:
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a word with you.

Provost:
As many as you please.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

CLAUDIO:
Now, sister, what's the comfort?

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO:
Is there no remedy?

ISABELLA:
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.

CLAUDIO:
But is there any?

ISABELLA:
Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA:
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined scope.

CLAUDIO:
But in what nature?

ISABELLA:
In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO:
Let me know the point.

ISABELLA:
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO:
Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mine arms.

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO:
The prenzie Angelo!

ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed.

CLAUDIO:
O heavens! it cannot be.

ISABELLA:
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA:
O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA:
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he affections in him,
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

ISABELLA:
Which is the least?

CLAUDIO:
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA:
What says my brother?

CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful thing.

ISABELLA:
And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO:
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA:
O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
'Tis best thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO:
O hear me, Isabella!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

ISABELLA:
What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
would require is likewise your own benefit.

ISABELLA:
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO:
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hold you there: farewell.
Provost, a word with you!

Provost:
What's your will, father

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

Provost:
In good time.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substitute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA:
I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover his government.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; and much please the absent duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business.

ISABELLA:
Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA:
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA:
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
is washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world! What corruption in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it.

ISABELLA:
Show me how, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment in the current, made it more
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course,--and now follows
all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think you of it?

ISABELLA:
The image of it gives me content already; and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
it may be quickly.

ISABELLA:
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

ELBOW:
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O heavens! what stuff is here

POMPEY:
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.

ELBOW:
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, good brother father. What offence hath
this man made you, sir?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY:
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
sir, I would prove--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
as good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW:
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.

POMPEY:
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
friend of mine.

LUCIO:
How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still thus, and thus; still worse!

LUCIO:
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
still, ha?

POMPEY:
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
is herself in the tub.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
to prison, Pompey?

POMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO:
Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.

POMPEY:
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO:
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.

LUCIO:
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

POMPEY:
You will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
what news?

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.

LUCIO:
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
What news, friar, of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO:
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO:
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
puts transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO:
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him: something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO:
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
woman after this downright way of creation: is it
true, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should he be made, then?

LUCIO:
Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
motion generative; that's infallible.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO:
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not inclined that way.

LUCIO:
O, sir, you are deceived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis not possible.

LUCIO:
Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
that let me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO:
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
withdrawing.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
understand, the greater file of the subject held the
duke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no question but he was.

LUCIO:
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO:
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
dearer love.

LUCIO:
Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you, your name?

LUCIO:
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
report you.

LUCIO:
I fear you not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO:
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of were returned again: the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency; sparrows must not build in his
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
never bring them to light: would he were returned!
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
Go; away with her to prison!

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
a merciful man; good my lord.

ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant.

Provost:
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
your honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!

ESCALUS:
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
no more words.
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
so with him.

Provost:
So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
advised him for the entertainment of death.

ESCALUS:
Good even, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bliss and goodness on you!

ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his holiness.

ESCALUS:
What news abroad i' the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, but that there is so great a fever on
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?

ESCALUS:
One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
resolved to die.

ESCALUS:
You have paid the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS:
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be with you!
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things!
Craft against vice I must apply:
With Angelo to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.


MARIANA:
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised here to meet.

MARIANA:
You have not been inquired after:
I have sat here all day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.

MARIANA:
I am always bound to you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?

ISABELLA:
He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA:
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA:
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
I come about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good.

ISABELLA:
I do desire the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

MARIANA:
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.

MARIANA:
Will't please you walk aside?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA:
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA:
Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'

MARIANA:
Fear me not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

Provost:
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY:
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
cut off a woman's head.

Provost:
Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
notorious bawd.

POMPEY:
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
would be glad to receive some instruction from my
fellow partner.

Provost:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
Do you call, sir?

Provost:
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.

ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

Provost:
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
the scale.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON:
Ay, sir; a mystery

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
should be hanged, I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery.

POMPEY:
Proof?

ABHORSON:
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
apparel fits your thief.

Provost:
Are you agreed?

POMPEY:
Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness.

Provost:
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
to-morrow four o'clock.

ABHORSON:
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

POMPEY:
I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
a good turn.

Provost:
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not wake.

Provost:
Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself.
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio.
Welcome father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

Provost:
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not Isabel?

Provost:
No.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They will, then, ere't be long.

Provost:
What comfort is for Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There's some in hope.

Provost:
It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
Now are they come.
This is a gentle provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

Provost:
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?

Provost:
None, sir, none.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

Provost:
Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.
This is his lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And here comes Claudio's pardon.

Messenger:

Provost:
I shall obey him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pray you, let's hear.

Provost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon?

Provost:
A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
that is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.

Provost:
His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is now apparent?

Provost:
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seems he to be touched?

Provost:
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He wants advice.

Provost:
He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy.

Provost:
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
In the delaying death.

Provost:
A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.

Provost:
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death: you know the course is common. If any thing
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
against it with my life.

Provost:
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

Provost:
To him, and to his substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
avouch the justice of your dealing?

Provost:
But what likelihood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
signet is not strange to you.

Provost:
I know them both.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within these two days he will be here.
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
things should be: all difficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

POMPEY:
I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
of profession: one would think it were Mistress
Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
much in request, for the old women were all dead.
Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
Master Barnardine!

ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:

POMPEY:
Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
good, sir, to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE:

ABHORSON:
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

POMPEY:
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
executed, and sleep afterwards.

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and fetch him out.

POMPEY:
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON:
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

POMPEY:
Very ready, sir.

BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE:
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 't.

POMPEY:
O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
sounder all the next day.

ABHORSON:
Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you.

BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
consent to die this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE:
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
persuasion.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But hear you.

BARNARDINE:
Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

Provost:
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

Provost:
Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

Provost:
This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.

Provost:
I am your free dependant.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.

Provost:
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.

Provost:
I'll make all speed.

ISABELLA:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.

ISABELLA:
Ho, by your leave!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA:
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA:
Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.

ISABELLA:
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
And general honour.

ISABELLA:
I am directed by you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?

LUCIO:
Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not within, sir.

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home, he had lived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO:
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO:
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?

LUCIO:
Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO:
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.

ESCALUS:
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
redeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS:
I guess not.

ANGELO:
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
they should exhibit their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS:
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
complaints, and to deliver us from devices
hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
against us.

ANGELO:
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him.

ESCALUS:
I shall, sir. Fare you well.

ANGELO:
Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters at fit time deliver me
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

FRIAR PETER:
It shall be speeded well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

ISABELLA:
To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA:
Be ruled by him.

ISABELLA:
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA:
I would Friar Peter--

ISABELLA:
O, peace! the friar is come.

FRIAR PETER:
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

ANGELO:
Happy return be to your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO:
You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand;
And good supporters are you.

FRIAR PETER:
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

ISABELLA:
Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.

ISABELLA:
O worthy duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

ANGELO:
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice,--

ISABELLA:
By course of justice!

ANGELO:
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

ISABELLA:
Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not strange and strange?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, it is ten times strange.

ISABELLA:
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with her! Poor soul,
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA:
O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA:
O gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLA:
I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--

LUCIO:
That's I, an't like your grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

ISABELLA:
That's he indeed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO:
No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO:
I warrant your honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA:
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO:
Right.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA:
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Mended again. The matter; proceed.

ISABELLA:
In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is most likely!

ISABELLA:
O, that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to complain.

ISABELLA:
And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA:
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO:
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
For certain words he spake against your grace
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

LUCIO:
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

FRIAR PETER:
Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

FRIAR PETER:
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

LUCIO:
My lord, most villanously; believe it.

FRIAR PETER:
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
But at this instant he is sick my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accused,
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
First, let her show her face, and after speak.

MARIANA:
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you married?

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a maid?

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A widow, then?

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?

LUCIO:
My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

MARIANA:
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.

LUCIO:
He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA:
Now I come to't my lord
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
And charges him my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.

ANGELO:
Charges she more than me?

MARIANA:
Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husband.

MARIANA:
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO:
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

MARIANA:
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagined person.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Know you this woman?

LUCIO:
Carnally, she says.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, no more!

LUCIO:
Enough, my lord.

ANGELO:
My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition, but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.

MARIANA:
Noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

ANGELO:
I did but smile till now:
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, with my heart
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER:
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go do it instantly.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.

ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

LUCIO:
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke.

ESCALUS:
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
notable fellow.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her.

LUCIO:
Not better than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS:
Say you?

LUCIO:
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
I will go darkly to work with her.

LUCIO:
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

ESCALUS:
Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
that you have said.

LUCIO:
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
the provost.

ESCALUS:
In very good time: speak not you to him till we
call upon you.

LUCIO:
Mum.

ESCALUS:
Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis false.

ESCALUS:
How! know you where you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO:
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

ESCALUS:
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS:
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

ANGELO:
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

LUCIO:
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
do you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.

LUCIO:
O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO:
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
much more, much worse.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

ANGELO:
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
treasonable abuses!

ESCALUS:
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
with the other confederate companion!

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO:
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

LUCIO:
This may prove worse than hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession:
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO:
I was, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.

ISABELLA:
O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pardon'd, Isabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

ISABELLA:
I do, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!

MARIANA:
O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
To buy you a better husband.

MARIANA:
O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never crave him; we are definitive.

MARIANA:
Gentle my liege,--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death!
Now, sir, to you.

MARIANA:
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

MARIANA:
Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He dies for Claudio's death.

ISABELLA:
Most bounteous sir,
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.

MARIANA:
Merely, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

Provost:
It was commanded so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Had you a special warrant for the deed?

Provost:
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.

Provost:
Pardon me, noble lord:
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's he?

Provost:
His name is Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

ESCALUS:
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO:
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which is that Barnardine?

Provost:
This, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

Provost:
This is another prisoner that I saved.
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

LUCIO:
'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

LUCIO:
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

LUCIO:
Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
whipping, and hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Slandering a prince deserves it.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

SLY:
I'll pheeze you, in faith.

Hostess:
A pair of stocks, you rogue!

SLY:
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!

Hostess:
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?

SLY:
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
bed, and warm thee.

Hostess:
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
third--borough.

SLY:
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
and kindly.

Lord:
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

First Huntsman:
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it at the merest loss
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.

Lord:
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and look unto them all:
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.

First Huntsman:
I will, my lord.

Lord:
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?

Second Huntsman:
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.

Lord:
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would not the beggar then forget himself?

First Huntsman:
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.

Second Huntsman:
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.

Lord:
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he wakes,
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
It will be pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

First Huntsman:
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less than what we say he is.

Lord:
Take him up gently and to bed with him;
And each one to his office when he wakes.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
How now! who is it?

Servant:
An't please your honour, players
That offer service to your lordship.

Lord:
Bid them come near.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.

Players:
We thank your honour.

Lord:
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?

A Player:
So please your lordship to accept our duty.

Lord:
With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.

A Player:
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.

Lord:
'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
For yet his honour never heard a play--
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
If you should smile he grows impatient.

A Player:
Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
Were he the veriest antic in the world.

Lord:
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And give them friendly welcome every one:
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
He bear himself with honourable action,
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love?'
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which in a napkin being close convey'd
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

SLY:
For God's sake, a pot of small ale.

First Servant:
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?

Second Servant:
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?

Third Servant:
What raiment will your honour wear to-day?

SLY:
I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
toes look through the over-leather.

Lord:
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
O, that a mighty man of such descent,
Of such possessions and so high esteem,
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!

SLY:
What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
bestraught: here's--

Third Servant:
O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!

Second Servant:
O, this is it that makes your servants droop!

Lord:
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.

First Servant:
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.

Second Servant:
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

Lord:
We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
And how she was beguiled and surprised,
As lively painted as the deed was done.

Third Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.

Lord:
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age.

First Servant:
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
She was the fairest creature in the world;
And yet she is inferior to none.

SLY:
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.

Second Servant:
Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
O, that once more you knew but what you are!
These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.

SLY:
These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
But did I never speak of all that time?

First Servant:
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
And rail upon the hostess of the house;
And say you would present her at the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Ay, the woman's maid of the house.

Third Servant:
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Amen.

SLY:
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.

Page:
How fares my noble lord?

SLY:
Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.
Where is my wife?

Page:
Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?

SLY:
Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.

Page:
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.

SLY:
I know it well. What must I call her?

Lord:
Madam.

SLY:
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?

Lord:
'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
call ladies.

SLY:
Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
And slept above some fifteen year or more.

Page:
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.

SLY:
'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.

Page:
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two,
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians have expressly charged,
In peril to incur your former malady,
That I should yet absent me from your bed:
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.

SLY:
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh and the blood.

Messenger:
Your honour's players, heating your amendment,
Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.

SLY:
Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?

Page:
No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.

SLY:
What, household stuff?

Page:
It is a kind of history.

SLY:
Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
With his good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant, well approved in all,
Here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: what company is this?

TRANIO:
Master, some show to welcome us to town.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know;
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder:
If either of you both love Katharina,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

GREMIO:

KATHARINA:
I pray you, sir, is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?

HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
I wis it is not half way to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.

HORTENSIA:
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

GREMIO:
And me too, good Lord!

TRANIO:
Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

LUCENTIO:
But in the other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio!

TRANIO:
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

KATHARINA:
A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.

BIANCA:
Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to took and practise by myself.

LUCENTIO:
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca's grief.

GREMIO:
Why will you mew her up,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
Go in, Bianca:
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own children in good bringing up:
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bianca.

KATHARINA:
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?

GREMIO:
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her father.

HORTENSIO:
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
that we may yet again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
labour and effect one thing specially.

GREMIO:
What's that, I pray?

HORTENSIO:
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

GREMIO:
A husband! a devil.

HORTENSIO:
I say, a husband.

GREMIO:
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
to be married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
would take her with all faults, and money enough.

GREMIO:
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
every morning.

HORTENSIO:
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
How say you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her! Come on.

TRANIO:
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?

LUCENTIO:
O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible or likely;
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
I found the effect of love in idleness:
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as secret and as dear
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.

TRANIO:
Master, it is no time to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from the heart:
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.

TRANIO:
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

LUCENTIO:
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO:
Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
And with her breath she did perfume the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

TRANIO:
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his hands of her,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.

LUCENTIO:
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
But art thou not advised, he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?

TRANIO:
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.

LUCENTIO:
I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Master, for my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

LUCENTIO:
Tell me thine first.

TRANIO:
You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the maid:
That's your device.

LUCENTIO:
It is: may it be done?

TRANIO:
Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countrymen and banquet them?

LUCENTIO:
Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
For man or master; then it follows thus;
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants as I should:
I will some other be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

TRANIO:
So had you need.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be obedient;
For so your father charged me at our parting,
'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense;
I am content to be Lucentio,
Because so well I love Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Here comes the rogue.
Sirrah, where have you been?

BIONDELLO:
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?

LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save my life:
You understand me?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne'er a whit.

LUCENTIO:
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

BIONDELLO:
The better for him: would I were so too!

TRANIO:
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
But in all places else your master Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if
thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
and weighty.

First Servant:
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.

SLY:
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
comes there any more of it?

Page:
My lord, 'tis but begun.

SLY:
'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
would 'twere done!

PETRUCHIO:
Verona, for a while I take my leave,
To see my friends in Padua, but of all
My best beloved and approved friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.

GRUMIO:
Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
rebused your worship?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

GRUMIO:
Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
I should knock you here, sir?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

GRUMIO:
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
you first,
And then I know after who comes by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

GRUMIO:
Help, masters, help! my master is mad.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

HORTENSIO:
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.

HORTENSIO:
'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
this quarrel.

GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
And could not get him for my heart to do it.

GRUMIO:
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
now with, 'knocking at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
To seek their fortunes farther than at home
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

GRUMIO:
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
so money comes withal.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Is that she is intolerable curst
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
That, were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

HORTENSIO:
Her father is Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
I know her father, though I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unless you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO:
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
would think scolding would do little good upon him:
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
You know him not, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
And her withholds from me and other more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
Supposing it a thing impossible,
For those defects I have before rehearsed,
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.

GRUMIO:
Katharina the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

HORTENSIO:
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
That so I may, by this device, at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected court her by herself.

GRUMIO:
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
how the young folks lay their heads together!
Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, stand by a while.

GRUMIO:
A proper stripling and an amorous!

GREMIO:
O, very well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to her:
You understand me: over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
And let me have them very well perfumed
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

LUCENTIO:
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
As for my patron, stand you so assured,
As firmly as yourself were still in place:
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

GREMIO:
O this learning, what a thing it is!

GRUMIO:
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

PETRUCHIO:
Peace, sirrah!

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promised to inquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man, for learning and behavior
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.

GREMIO:
Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.

GRUMIO:
And that his bags shall prove.

HORTENSIO:
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

GREMIO:
So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO:
I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?

PETRUCHIO:
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good days and long to see.

GREMIO:
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?

PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?

GRUMIO:
Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.

PETRUCHIO:
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.

GRUMIO:
For he fears none.

GREMIO:
Hortensio, hark:
This gentleman is happily arrived,
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.

HORTENSIO:
I promised we would be contributors
And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.

GREMIO:
And so we will, provided that he win her.

GRUMIO:
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

TRANIO:
Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO:
He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?

TRANIO:
Even he, Biondello.

GREMIO:
Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--

TRANIO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?

PETRUCHIO:
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

TRANIO:
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.

LUCENTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, a word ere you go;
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?

TRANIO:
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

GREMIO:
No; if without more words you will get you hence.

TRANIO:
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?

GREMIO:
But so is not she.

TRANIO:
For what reason, I beseech you?

GREMIO:
For this reason, if you'll know,
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.

HORTENSIO:
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
Do me this right; hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown;
And were his daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

GREMIO:
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCENTIO:
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

HORTENSIO:
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

TRANIO:
No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.

GREMIO:
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed:
The younger then is free and not before.

TRANIO:
If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.

TRANIO:
Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And do as adversaries do in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

GRUMIO:
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

BIANCA:
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA:
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.

BIANCA:
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.

KATHARINA:
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?

BIANCA:
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
him.

KATHARINA:
O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

KATHARINA:
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

KATHARINA:
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.

KATHARINA:
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.

BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes here?

GREMIO:
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?

BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

GREMIO:
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.

PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
I do present you with a man of mine,
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

BAPTISTA:
You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO:
I see you do not mean to part with her,
Or else you like not of my company.

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
A man well known throughout all Italy.

BAPTISTA:
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.

GREMIO:
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

GREMIO:
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.

BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?

TRANIO:
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That, being a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the education of your daughters,
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.

BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?

TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters; and tell them both,
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?

BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of my lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet together
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
So I to her and so she yields to me;
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.

BAPTISTA:
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?

HORTENSIO:
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

BAPTISTA:
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

HORTENSIO:
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

BAPTISTA:
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with them:'
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
O, how I long to have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA:
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO:
I pray you do.
I will attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.

KATHARINA:
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.

KATHARINA:
Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!

KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?

KATHARINA:
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.

KATHARINA:
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then, to pluck it out.

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.

KATHARINA:
In his tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
Whose tongue?

KATHARINA:
Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.

PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

KATHARINA:
That I'll try.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.

KATHARINA:
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

KATHARINA:
What is your crest? a coxcomb?

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

KATHARINA:
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

KATHARINA:
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.

KATHARINA:
There is, there is.

PETRUCHIO:
Then show it me.

KATHARINA:
Had I a glass, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?

KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such a young one.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

KATHARINA:
Yet you are wither'd.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.

KATHARINA:
I care not.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.

KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
Where did you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO:
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

KATHARINA:
A witty mother! witless else her son.

PETRUCHIO:
Am I not wise?

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
Thou must be married to no man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.
Here comes your father: never make denial;
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO:
How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHARINA:
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

GREMIO:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
hang'd first.

TRANIO:
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.

BAPTISTA:
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.

GREMIO:
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
We will have rings and things and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.

GREMIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

BAPTISTA:
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

GREMIO:
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for:
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.

TRANIO:
And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.

GREMIO:
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.

GREMIO:
But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?

GREMIO:
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.

TRANIO:
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son:
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all:
That she shall have; besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have I choked you with an argosy?

TRANIO:
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.

GREMIO:
Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
And she can have no more than all I have:
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

TRANIO:
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA:
I must confess your offer is the best;
And, let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
if you should die before him, where's her dower?

TRANIO:
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO:
And may not young men die, as well as old?

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katharina is to be married:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Signior Gremio:
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.

GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
Now I fear thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

TRANIO:
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

LUCENTIO:
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?

HORTENSIO:
But, wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
And when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

LUCENTIO:
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.

BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

HORTENSIO:
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your instrument.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO:
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
beguile the old pantaloon.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrument's in tune.

BIANCA:
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair not.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO:
All but the base.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

BIANCA:
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO:
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.

BIANCA:
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

HORTENSIO:
You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in three parts.

LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA:
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

BIANCA:

Servant:
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.

BIANCA:
Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.

LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.

HORTENSIO:
But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'

TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina had never seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
For such an injury would vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.

BIONDELLO:
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
you never heard of!

BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may that be?

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?

BAPTISTA:
Is he come?

BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA:
What then?

BIONDELLO:
He is coming.

BAPTISTA:
When will he be here?

BIONDELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you there.

TRANIO:
But say, what to thine old news?

BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?

BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BAPTISTA:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not say he comes?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.

BIONDELLO:
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man
Is more than one,
And yet not many.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?

BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
And yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA:
And yet you halt not.

TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.

PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
And tells us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.

TRANIO:
See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and see the event of this.

TRANIO:
But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
As I before unparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

LUCENTIO:
Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.

TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our vantage in this business:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I came from school.

TRANIO:
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

GREMIO:
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.

TRANIO:
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.

GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.

GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO:
What said the wench when he rose again?

GREMIO:
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before:
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.

BAPTISTA:
Is't possible you will away to-night?

PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day, before night come:
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.

TRANIO:
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

PETRUCHIO:
It may not be.

GREMIO:
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content.

KATHARINA:
Are you content to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

KATHARINA:
Now, if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.

KATHARINA:
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.

PETRUCHIO:
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.

KATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

KATARINA:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist.

PETRUCHIO:
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is mine own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee against a million.

BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO:
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

TRANIO:
Of all mad matches never was the like.

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?

BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

GREMIO:
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
And let Bianca take her sister's room.

TRANIO:
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?

BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.

GRUMIO:
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CURTIS:
Who is that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO:
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS:
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
on no water.

CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?

GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself, fellow Curtis.

CURTIS:
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

GRUMIO:
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS:
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.

CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
will thaw.

CURTIS:
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their new fustian, their white
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
the carpets laid, and every thing in order?

CURTIS:
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
mistress fallen out.

CURTIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio.

GRUMIO:
Lend thine ear.

CURTIS:
Here.

GRUMIO:
There.

CURTIS:
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.

GRUMIO:
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--

CURTIS:
Both of one horse?

GRUMIO:
What's that to thee?

CURTIS:
Why, a horse.

GRUMIO:
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.

CURTIS:
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.

GRUMIO:
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?

CURTIS:
They are.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth.

CURTIS:
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenance my mistress.

GRUMIO:
Why, she hath a face of her own.

CURTIS:
Who knows not that?

GRUMIO:
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
countenance her.

CURTIS:
I call them forth to credit her.

GRUMIO:
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.

NATHANIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!

PHILIP:
How now, Grumio!

JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!

NICHOLAS:
Fellow Grumio!

NATHANIEL:
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
companions, is all ready, and all things neat?

NATHANIEL:
All things is ready. How near is our master?

GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.

PETRUCHIO:
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?

ALL SERVING-MEN:
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?

GRUMIO:
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?

GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
Sound, sound, sound, sound!
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
It was the friar of orders grey,
As he forth walked on his way:--
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?

KATHARINA:
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.

PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
What's this? mutton?

First Servant:
Ay.

PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?

PETER:
I.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you were so contented.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
And, for this night, we'll fast for company:
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
Peter, didst ever see the like?

PETER:
He kills her in her own humour.

GRUMIO:
Where is he?

CURTIS:
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.

PETRUCHIO:
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her;
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

TRANIO:
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.

LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?

BIANCA:
What, master, read you? first resolve me that.

LUCENTIO:
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.

BIANCA:
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO:
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!

HORTENSIO:
Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.

TRANIO:
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a god of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.

TRANIO:
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!

HORTENSIO:
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO:
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

BIANCA:
Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?

TRANIO:
Mistress, we have.

LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.

BIANCA:
God give him joy!

TRANIO:
Ay, and he'll tame her.

BIANCA:
He says so, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, is there such a place?

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
What is he, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.

LUCENTIO:
And what of him, Tranio?

TRANIO:
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the right Vincentio
Take in your love, and then let me alone.

Pedant:
God save you, sir!

TRANIO:
And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

Pedant:
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?

Pedant:
Of Mantua.

TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?

Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.

TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them.

TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

TRANIO:
Among them know you one Vincentio?

Pedant:
I know him not, but I have heard of him;
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO:
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO:

TRANIO:
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you take upon you as you should;
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.

TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

GRUMIO:
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.

KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
Upon entreaty have a present aims;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

GRUMIO:
What say you to a neat's foot?

KATHARINA:
'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.

GRUMIO:
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA:
I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO:
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
A dish that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO:
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

KATHARINA:
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO:
Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.

GRUMIO:
Why then, the mustard without the beef.

KATHARINA:
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
That triumph thus upon my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORTENSIO:
Mistress, what cheer?

KATHARINA:
Faith, as cold as can be.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, let it stand.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.

KATHARINA:
I thank you, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.

PETRUCHIO:

Haberdasher:
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these

PETRUCHIO:
When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then.

HORTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.

KATHARINA:
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none.

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO:

Tailor:
You bid me make it orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.

KATHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.

Tailor:
She says your worship means to make
a puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.

Tailor:
Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
Just as my master had direction:
Grumio gave order how it should be done.

GRUMIO:
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.

Tailor:
But how did you desire it should be made?

GRUMIO:
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

Tailor:
But did you not request to have it cut?

GRUMIO:
Thou hast faced many things.

Tailor:
I have.

GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.

Tailor:
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify

PETRUCHIO:
Read it.

GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread: I said a gown.

PETRUCHIO:
Proceed.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess the cape.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.

Tailor:

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, there's the villany.

GRUMIO:
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor:
This is true that I say: an I had thee
in place where, thou shouldst know it.

GRUMIO:
I am for thee straight: take thou the
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.

HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

GRUMIO:
You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.

PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

GRUMIO:
Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
gown for thy master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?

GRUMIO:
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
O, fie, fie, fie!

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
Away! I say; commend me to thy master.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest mean habiliments:
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What is the jay more precious than the lark,
Because his fathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the eel,
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array.
if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there by dinner-time.

KATHARINA:
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.

PETRUCHIO:
It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?

Pedant:
Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.

Pedant:
I warrant you.
But, sir, here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were school'd.

TRANIO:
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.

TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

BIONDELLO:
I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.

TRANIO:
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
I pray you stand good father to me now,
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

Pedant:
Soft son!
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself:
And, for the good report I hear of you
And for the love he beareth to your daughter
And she to him, to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him match'd; and if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot be with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

TRANIO:
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
As shall with either part's agreement stand?

BAPTISTA:
Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily we might be interrupted.

TRANIO:
Then at my lodging, an it like you:
There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here:
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

BAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO:
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

TRANIO:
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.

BAPTISTA:
I follow you.

BIONDELLO:
Cambio!

LUCENTIO:
What sayest thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

LUCENTIO:
Biondello, what of that?

BIONDELLO:
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO:
I pray thee, moralize them.

BIONDELLO:
Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
deceiving father of a deceitful son.

LUCENTIO:
And what of him?

BIONDELLO:
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

LUCENTIO:
And then?

BIONDELLO:
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
command at all hours.

LUCENTIO:
And what of all this?

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
ever and a day.

LUCENTIO:
Hearest thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO:
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
you come with your appendix.

LUCENTIO:
I may, and will, if she be so contented:
She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

KATHARINA:
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

KATHARINA:
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!

HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, or we shall never go.

KATHARINA:
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.

PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon.

KATHARINA:
I know it is the moon.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.

KATHARINA:
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for Katharina.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! company is coming here.
Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.

HORTENSIO:
A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

KATHARINA:
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man, whom favourable stars
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.

KATHARINA:
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.

VINCENTIO:
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

PETRUCHIO:
What is his name?

VINCENTIO:
Lucentio, gentle sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO:
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?

HORTENSIO:
I do assure thee, father, so it is.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.

LUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
at home; therefore leave us.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.

GREMIO:
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

VINCENTIO:
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.

GREMIO:
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.

Pedant:
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?

VINCENTIO:
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?

Pedant:
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.

VINCENTIO:
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
make merry withal?

Pedant:
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
need none, so long as I live.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.

Pedant:
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
looking out at the window.

VINCENTIO:
Art thou his father?

Pedant:
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO:

Pedant:
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.

BIONDELLO:
I have seen them in the church together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.

VINCENTIO:

BIONDELLO:
Hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO:
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?

BIONDELLO:
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life.

VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
thy master's father, Vincentio?

BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
see where he looks out of the window.

VINCENTIO:
Is't so, indeed.

BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.

Pedant:
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!

PETRUCHIO:
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
this controversy.

TRANIO:
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

VINCENTIO:
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
the university.

TRANIO:
How now! what's the matter?

BAPTISTA:
What, is the man lunatic?

TRANIO:
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.

VINCENTIO:
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

BAPTISTA:
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
you think is his name?

VINCENTIO:
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
name is Tranio.

Pedant:
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

VINCENTIO:
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?

TRANIO:
Call forth an officer.
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO:
Carry me to the gaol!

GREMIO:
Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.

BAPTISTA:
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.

GREMIO:
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
is the right Vincentio.

Pedant:
Swear, if thou darest.

GREMIO:
Nay, I dare not swear it.

TRANIO:
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.

GREMIO:
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

BAPTISTA:
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!

VINCENTIO:
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous villain!

BIONDELLO:
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear him, or else we are all undone.

LUCENTIO:

VINCENTIO:
Lives my sweet son?

BIANCA:
Pardon, dear father.

BAPTISTA:
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?

LUCENTIO:
Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio;
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.

GREMIO:
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO:
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?

BAPTISTA:
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

BIANCA:
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO:
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
me to the gaol.

BAPTISTA:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
without asking my good will?

VINCENTIO:
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.

BAPTISTA:
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

LUCENTIO:
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.

GREMIO:
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.

KATHARINA:
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.

PETRUCHIO:
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

KATHARINA:
What, in the midst of the street?

PETRUCHIO:
What, art thou ashamed of me?

KATHARINA:
No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.

KATHARINA:
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.

LUCENTIO:
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
And time it is, when raging war is done,
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTISTA:
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

PETRUCHIO:
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

HORTENSIO:
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow:
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO:
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.

Widow:
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.

PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.

KATHARINA:
Mistress, how mean you that?

Widow:
Thus I conceive by him.

PETRUCHIO:
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO:
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO:
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHARINA:
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.

Widow:
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
And now you know my meaning,

KATHARINA:
A very mean meaning.

Widow:
Right, I mean you.

KATHARINA:
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

PETRUCHIO:
To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO:
To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO:
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

HORTENSIO:
That's my office.

PETRUCHIO:
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!

BAPTISTA:
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

GREMIO:
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

BIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

BIANCA:
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!

BIANCA:
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.

PETRUCHIO:
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.

TRANIO:
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself and catches for his master.

PETRUCHIO:
A good swift simile, but something currish.

TRANIO:
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCENTIO:
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?

PETRUCHIO:
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

BAPTISTA:
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth send for her,
Shall win the wager which we will propose.

HORTENSIO:
Content. What is the wager?

LUCENTIO:
Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
Twenty crowns!
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty times so much upon my wife.

LUCENTIO:
A hundred then.

HORTENSIO:
Content.

PETRUCHIO:
A match! 'tis done.

HORTENSIO:
Who shall begin?

LUCENTIO:
That will I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.

BIONDELLO:
I go.

BAPTISTA:
Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.

LUCENTIO:
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
How now! what news?

BIONDELLO:
Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.

PETRUCHIO:
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

GREMIO:
Ay, and a kind one too:
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.

PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.

HORTENSIO:
I am afraid, sir,
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
Now, where's my wife?

BIONDELLO:
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come: she bids you come to her.

PETRUCHIO:
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Say, I command her to come to me.

HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO:
What?

HORTENSIO:
She will not.

PETRUCHIO:
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.

BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!

KATHARINA:
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?

KATHARINA:
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO:
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.

LUCENTIO:
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

HORTENSIO:
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?

BAPTISTA:
Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is changed, as she had never been.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built virtue and obedience.
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.

Widow:
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!

BIANCA:
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?

LUCENTIO:
I would your duty were as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.

BIANCA:
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO:
Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

Widow:
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, I say; and first begin with her.

Widow:
She shall not.

PETRUCHIO:
I say she shall: and first begin with her.

KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO:
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.

VINCENTIO:
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.

LUCENTIO:
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
And, being a winner, God give you good night!

HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO:
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.

Master:
Boatswain!

Boatswain:
Here, master: what cheer?

Master:
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.

Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!

ALONSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
Play the men.

Boatswain:
I pray now, keep below.

ANTONIO:
Where is the master, boatswain?

Boatswain:
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.

GONZALO:
Nay, good, be patient.

Boatswain:
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.

GONZALO:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.

GONZALO:
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?

SEBASTIAN:
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

Boatswain:
Work you then.

ANTONIO:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

GONZALO:
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.

Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Mariners:
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm out of patience.

ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!

GONZALO:
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.

ANTONIO:
Let's all sink with the king.

SEBASTIAN:
Let's take leave of him.

GONZALO:
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.

MIRANDA:
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.

PROSPERO:
Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.

MIRANDA:
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

PROSPERO:
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.

MIRANDA:
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

PROSPERO:
The hour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Out three years old.

MIRANDA:
Certainly, sir, I can.

PROSPERO:
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?

PROSPERO:
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.

MIRANDA:
But that I do not.

PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Sir, are not you my father?

PROSPERO:
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.

MIRANDA:
O, my heart bleeds
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.

PROSPERO:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?

MIRANDA:
Sir, most heedfully.

PROSPERO:
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, who to advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

MIRANDA:
O, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO:
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which, but by being so retired,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dost thou hear?

MIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.

MIRANDA:
O the heavens!

PROSPERO:
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.

MIRANDA:
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO:
Now the condition.
The King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO:
Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Were most impertinent.

MIRANDA:
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?

PROSPERO:
Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
A mark so bloody on the business, but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.

MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

PROSPERO:
O, a cherubim
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.

MIRANDA:
How came we ashore?

PROSPERO:
By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.

MIRANDA:
Would I might
But ever see that man!

PROSPERO:
Now I arise:
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

MIRANDA:
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO:
Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.

PROSPERO:
Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO:
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?

ARIEL:
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
And all the devils are here.'

PROSPERO:
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?

ARIEL:
Close by, my master.

PROSPERO:
But are they, Ariel, safe?

ARIEL:
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's son have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO:
Of the king's ship
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
And all the rest o' the fleet.

ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.

PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
What is the time o' the day?

ARIEL:
Past the mid season.

PROSPERO:
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously.

ARIEL:
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Which is not yet perform'd me.

PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
What is't thou canst demand?

ARIEL:
My liberty.

PROSPERO:
Before the time be out? no more!

ARIEL:
I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.

PROSPERO:
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?

ARIEL:
No.

PROSPERO:
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o' the earth
When it is baked with frost.

ARIEL:
I do not, sir.

PROSPERO:
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

ARIEL:
No, sir.

PROSPERO:
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO:
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
They would not take her life. Is not this true?

ARIEL:
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO:
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.

PROSPERO:
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee out.

ARIEL:
I thank thee, master.

PROSPERO:
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

ARIEL:
Pardon, master;
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO:
Do so, and after two days
I will discharge thee.

ARIEL:
That's my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?

PROSPERO:
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!

MIRANDA:
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.

PROSPERO:
Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.

MIRANDA:
'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.

CALIBAN:

PROSPERO:
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Come, thou tortoise! when?
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.

ARIEL:
My lord it shall be done.

PROSPERO:
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

CALIBAN:
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!

PROSPERO:
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.

PROSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.

CALIBAN:
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

PROSPERO:
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this rock,
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

CALIBAN:
You taught me language; and my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!

PROSPERO:
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

CALIBAN:
No, pray thee.
I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make a vassal of him.

PROSPERO:
So, slave; hence!
Come unto these yellow sands,
And then take hands:
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist,
Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
Hark, hark!

FERDINAND:
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond.

MIRANDA:
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

PROSPERO:
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.

MIRANDA:
I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO:

FERDINAND:
Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.

FERDINAND:
My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The king my father wreck'd.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for mercy!

FERDINAND:
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!

FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
The queen of Naples.

PROSPERO:
Soft, sir! one word more.
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
One word more; I charge thee
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
From me, the lord on't.

FERDINAND:
No, as I am a man.

MIRANDA:
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.

PROSPERO:
Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND:
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.

MIRANDA:
O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and not fearful.

PROSPERO:
What? I say,
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA:
Beseech you, father.

PROSPERO:
Hence! hang not on my garments.

MIRANDA:
Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety.

PROSPERO:
Silence! one word more
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.

MIRANDA:
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.

PROSPERO:
Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them.

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now came from him.

PROSPERO:
Thou shalt be free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.

ARIEL:
To the syllable.

PROSPERO:
Come, follow. Speak not for him.

GONZALO:
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.

ANTONIO:
The visitor will not give him o'er so.

SEBASTIAN:
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.

GONZALO:
Sir,--

SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.

GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
A dollar.

GONZALO:
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.

SEBASTIAN:
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALONSO:
I prithee, spare.

GONZALO:
Well, I have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN:
He will be talking.

ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?

SEBASTIAN:
The old cock.

ANTONIO:
The cockerel.

SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

ANTONIO:
A laughter.

SEBASTIAN:
A match!

ADRIAN:
Though this island seem to be desert,--

SEBASTIAN:
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--

SEBASTIAN:
Yet,--

ADRIAN:
Yet,--

ANTONIO:
He could not miss't.

ADRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.

ANTONIO:
Temperance was a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

ADRIAN:
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

SEBASTIAN:
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANTONIO:
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GONZALO:
Here is everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO:
True; save means to live.

SEBASTIAN:
Of that there's none, or little.

GONZALO:
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANTONIO:
The ground indeed is tawny.

SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.

ANTONIO:
He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

GONZALO:
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN:
As many vouched rarities are.

GONZALO:
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
salt water.

ANTONIO:
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
say he lies?

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report

GONZALO:
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.

SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.

ADRIAN:
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen.

GONZALO:
Not since widow Dido's time.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN:
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
how you take it!

ADRIAN:
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.

GONZALO:
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

ADRIAN:
Carthage?

GONZALO:
I assure you, Carthage.

SEBASTIAN:
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the wall and houses too.

ANTONIO:
What impossible matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN:
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple.

ANTONIO:
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.

GONZALO:
Ay.

ANTONIO:
Why, in good time.

GONZALO:
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now queen.

ANTONIO:
And the rarest that e'er came there.

SEBASTIAN:
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

GONZALO:
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO:
That sort was well fished for.

GONZALO:
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?

ALONSO:
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?

FRANCISCO:
Sir, he may live:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.

ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.

SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
son,
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault's your own.

ALONSO:
So is the dear'st o' the loss.

GONZALO:
My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
Very well.

ANTONIO:
And most chirurgeonly.

GONZALO:
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.

SEBASTIAN:
Foul weather?

ANTONIO:
Very foul.

GONZALO:
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

ANTONIO:
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

SEBASTIAN:
Or docks, or mallows.

GONZALO:
And were the king on't, what would I do?

SEBASTIAN:
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

GONZALO:
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--

SEBASTIAN:
Yet he would be king on't.

ANTONIO:
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.

GONZALO:
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.

SEBASTIAN:
No marrying 'mong his subjects?

ANTONIO:
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

GONZALO:
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.

SEBASTIAN:
God save his majesty!

ANTONIO:
Long live Gonzalo!

GONZALO:
And,--do you mark me, sir?

ALONSO:
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

GONZALO:
I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing.

ANTONIO:
'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO:
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you: so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still.

ANTONIO:
What a blow was there given!

SEBASTIAN:
An it had not fallen flat-long.

GONZALO:
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing.

SEBASTIAN:
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

ANTONIO:
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

GONZALO:
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.

ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN:
Please you, sir,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.

ANTONIO:
We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

ALONSO:
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

SEBASTIAN:
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' the climate.

SEBASTIAN:
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to sleep.

ANTONIO:
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.

SEBASTIAN:
What, art thou waking?

ANTONIO:
Do you not hear me speak?

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
And yet so fast asleep.

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.

Foreword 



This tale grew in the telling, until it became a history of the Great 
War of the Ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history 
that preceded it. It was begun soon after The Hobbit was written and before 
its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished 
first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder 
Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do this 
for my own satisfaction, and I had little hope that other people would be 
interested in this work, especially since it was primarily linguistic in 
inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of 
'history' for Elvish tongues. 

When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope to 
no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from readers for 
more information concerning hobbits and their adventures. But the story was 
drawn irresistibly towards the older world, and became an account, as it 
were, of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been 
told. The process had begun in the writing of The Hobbit, in which there 
were already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the 
High-elves, and the ores, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of 
things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, 
the Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these 
glimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the Third 
Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring. 

Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got 
it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of The Lord of the 
Rings went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949, a period in which 
I had many duties that I did not neglect, and many other interests as a 
learner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was, of course, also 
increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which year the tale 
had not yet reached the end of Book One. In spite of the darkness of the 
next five years I found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned, 
and I plodded on, mostly by night, till I stood by Balin's tomb in Moria. 
There I halted for a long while. It was almost a year later when I went on 
and so came to Lothlurien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year 




I wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as Book Three, and 
the beginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons 
flared in Anurien and Thjoden came to Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had 
failed and there was no time for thought. 

It was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a 
war which it was my task to conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself 
to tackle the journey of Frodo to Mordor. These chapters, eventually to 
become Book Four, were written and sent out as a serial to my son, 
Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took another 
five years before the tale was brought to its present end; in that time I 
changed my house, my chair, and my college, and the days though less dark 
were no less laborious. Then when the ’end’ had at last been reached the 
whole story had to be revised, and indeed largely re-written backwards. And 
it had to be typed, and re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by 
the ten-fingered was beyond my means. 

The Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since it finally 
appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to 
the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning 
the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a 
tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the 
attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite 
them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is 
appealing or moving, and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault. 
Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it 
boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I 
have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they 
evidently prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed 
my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a 
long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at 
the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the 
passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially 
approved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, 
minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review 
the book or to write it again, he will pass over these in silence, except 
one that has been noted by others: the book is too short. 

As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the 
author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put 




down roots (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but its main 
theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as 
the link between it and The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, "The Shadow of the 
Past', is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It was written long before 
the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and 
from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same 
lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before 
in mind, or in some cases already written, and little or nothing in it was 
modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels. 

The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its 
conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development of the legend, 
then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against Sauron; he 
would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-dyr would not have 
been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, 
would m the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the 
missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would 
have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled 
Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits 
in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves. 

Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of 
those who like allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike 
allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old 
and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or 
feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of 
readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the 
one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed 
domination of the author. 

An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience, 
but the ways in which a story-germ uses the soil of experience are extremely 
complex, and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from 
evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous. It is also false, though 
naturally attractive, when the lives of an author and critic have 
overlapped, to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times 
common to both were necessarily the most powerful influences. One has 
indeed 

personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but 
as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth 




by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and 
the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead. Or 
to take a less grievous matter: it has been supposed by some that The 
Scouring of the Shire’ reflects the situation in England at the time when I 
was finishing my tale. It does not. It is an essential part of the plot, 
foreseen from the outset, though in the event modified by the character of 
Saruman as developed in the story without, need I say, any allegorical 
significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed 
some basis in experience, though slender (for the economic situation was 
entirely different), and much further back. The country in which I lived in 
childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when 
motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still 
building suburban railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last 
decrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago 
seemed to me so important. I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but 
his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named 
Sandy man. 

The Lord of the Rings is now issued in a new edition, and the 
opportunity has been taken of revising it. A number of errors and 
inconsistencies that still remained in the text have been corrected, and an 
attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive 
readers have raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries, and 
if some seem to have been passed over that may be because I have failed to 
keep my notes in order; but many enquiries could only be answered by 
additional appendices, or indeed by the production of an accessory volume 
containing much of the material that I did not include in the original 
edition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In the meantime 
this edition offers this Foreword, an addition to the Prologue, some notes, 
and an index of the names of persons and places. This index is in intention 
complete in items but not in references, since for the present purpose it 
has been necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full use of 
the material prepared for me by Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather to the 
accessory volume. 




* PROLOGUE * 



1. Concerning Hobbits 



This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a 
reader may discover much of their character and a little of their history. 
Further information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of 
Westmarch that has already been published, under the title of The Hobbit. 
That story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed 
by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, 
and called by him There and Back Again, since they told of his journey into 
the East and his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits 
in the great events of that Age that are here related. 

Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people 
from 

the outset, while some may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a 
few notes on the more important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, 
and the first adventure is briefly recalled. 

Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous 
formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled 
earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. 
They do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a 
forge -bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skilful with 
tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as 
they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to 
find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined 
to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and 
deft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art of 
disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to 
meet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to Men it may 
seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic of any kind, 
and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity 
and practice, and a close friendship with the earth, have rendered 




inimitable by bigger and clumsier races. 

For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout and 
stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height 
is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure. They seldom 
now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they say, and in ancient days 
they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), 
son of Isengrim the Second, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He 
was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old; 
but that curious matter is dealt with in this book. 

As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, 
in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk. They 
dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they 
seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad 
in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was 
commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was 
shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other 
useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather 
than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to 
laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and 
drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of 
six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and 
delighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and 
eagerly accepted. 

It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are 
relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old 
they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and 
disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship 
is can no longer be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in 
the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves still 
preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are 
concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom 
and Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in 
fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk 
became even aware of them. And the world being after all full of strange 
creatures beyond count, these little people seemed of very little 
importance. But in the days of Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly 
became, by no wish of their own, both important and renowned, and troubled 




the counsels of the Wise and the Great. 

Those days, the Third Age of Middle -earth, are now long past, and the 
shape of all lands has been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then 
lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger: the 
North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea. Of their original home the 
Hobbits in Bilbo's time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other 
than genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there remained 
still a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even 
gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and 
Men. Their own records began only after the settlement of the Shire, and 
their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering 
Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of 
their peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in 
the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time 
when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of 
Greenwood 

the Great and the Misty Mountains. Why they later undertook the hard and 
perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain. Their 
own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow 
that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was 
Mirkwood. 

Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become 
divided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and 
Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller, and shorter, and 
they were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble; 
and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier 
in build; their feet and hands were larger, and they preferred flat lands 
and riversides. The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair, and 
they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and 
of woodlands. 

The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and long 
lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward early, and 
roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others were still in the 
Wilderland. They were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit, 
and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one 
place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and 
holes. 




The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin, and 
were less shy of Men. They came west after the Harfoots and followed the 
course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt 
between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again. 

The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were 
more friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in 
language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to 
tilling. They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came down the 
River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had 
preceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were 
often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even 
in Bilbo's time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the 
greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland. 

In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains and the 
Mountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a remnant 
still dwelt there of the D®nedain, the kings of Men that came over the Sea 
out of Westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their 
North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to 
spare for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered 
communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been 
forgotten in Bilbo's time; but one of the first to become important still 
endured, though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood that 
lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire. 

It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their 
letters and began to write after the manner of the D®nedain, who had in 
their turn long before learned the art from the Elves. And in those days 
also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever 
after the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current 
through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the 
coasts of the Sea from B elf alas to Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their 
own, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of 
personal names out of the past. 

About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history with a 
reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first 
year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set 
out from Bree; and having obtained permission from the high king at 
Fornostl, they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following of 




Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been built in 
the days of the power of the North Kingdom, and they took ail the land 
beyond to dwell in, between the river and the Far Downs. All that was 
demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and 
all other bridges and roads, speed the king's messengers, and acknowledge 
his lordship. 

Thus began the Shire-reckoning, for the year of the crossing of the 
Brandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became Year One of the Shire, 
and all later dates were reckoned from it. 2 At once the western Hobbits fell 
in love with their new land, and they remained there, and soon passed once 
more out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was still a king 
they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by their own 
chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the 
last battle at Fornost with the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen 
to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record 
it. But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the Hobbits took the 
land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the 
authority of the king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were 
little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark 
Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that 
followed it. Many thousands then perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60) 
were at the time of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again become 
accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it had long 
been deserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, and 
there the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods. 

Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, 
and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south. The Hobbits 
named it the Shire, as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a 
district of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant comer of the 
world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less 
and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think 
that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all 
sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the 
Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of 
the Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember 
it. 

At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never 




fought among themselves. In olden days they had, of course, been often 
obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo's time 
that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and 
indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the 
Shire, was beyond living memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in 
which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Ores. Even the weathers had 
grown 

milder, and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in 
bitter white winters were now only a grandfather's tale. So, though there 
was still some store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly as 
trophies, hanging above hearths or on walls, or gathered into the museum at 
Michel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits 
had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a 
mathom. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, 
and 

many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son. 

Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. 

They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, 
perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, 
when put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief, 
foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well 
and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though 
slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty 
at bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, 
for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows. 
If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly under cover, 
as all trespassing beasts knew very well. 

All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they 
believed, and in such dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the 
course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually 
in the Shire in Bilbo's days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the 
poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living 
in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one 
window or none; while the well-to-do still constructed more luxurious 
versions of the simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large 
and ramifying tunnels (or smicils as they called them) were not everywhere to 
be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as they 




multiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions 
and the older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or in the chief 
township of the Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, there were now 
many houses of wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by 
millers, smiths, ropers, and Cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even 
when they had holes to live in. Hobbits had long been accustomed to build 
sheds and workshops. 

The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among 
the inhabitants of the Marish down by the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that 
quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore 
dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to be Stoors in a 
large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on 
their chins. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the 
folk of the Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River, which they 
afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the Shire up from 
south-away; and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not 
found elsewhere in the Shire. 

It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, 
was derived from the D®nedain. But the Hobbits may have learned it direct 
from the Elves, the teachers of Men in their youth. For the Elves of the 
High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that 
time at the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within reach 
of the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on 
the Tower Hills beyond the western marches. They shone far off in the 
moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. 
The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop 
of that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few 
Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever 
returned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats 
with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the days of 
the Shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the Elves, and grew 
afraid of them, and distrustful of those that had dealings with them; and 
the Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they 
turned their faces away from the hills in the west. 

The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits 
used it in their own fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses 
were usually long, low, and comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no 




more than built imitations of smials, thatched with dry grass or straw, or 
roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, 
belonged to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit -building had long since 
been altered, improved by devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by 
themselves. A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was the 
chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture. 

The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large, and 
inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very 
exceptional, as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship 
with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials, or 
the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives lived in 
(comparative) peace together in one ancestral and many -tunnelled mansion. 
All Hobbits were, in any case, clannish and reckoned up their relationships 
with great care. They drew long and elaborate family -trees with innumerable 
branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related 
to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out 
a family -tree that included even the more important members of the more 
important families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical 
trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in 
themselves, and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits 
delighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked to have books 
filled with things that they already knew, set out fair and square with no 
contradictions. 




2. Concerning Pipe-weed 



There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that must be 
mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed or inhaled, through pipes of 
clay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb, which they called 
pipe-weed or leaf, a variety probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery 
surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or 'art' as the Hobbits 
preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was 
put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since he 
and the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that 
follows, his remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be 
quoted. 

’This,' he says, 'is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our 
own invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke is not known, all the 
legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire 
smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that 
Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew the true 
pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year 
1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district, 
especially the varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and 
Southern Star. 

'How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day 
he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is 
said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went 
further from the Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned 
of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on the south 
slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first actual 
smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim, of course, to have done everything 
before the people of the Shire, whom they refer to as "colonists"; but in 
this case their claim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was 
from Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent 
centuries among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, 
as still passed to and fro through that ancient road-meeting. The home and 
centre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, The Prancing 




Pony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record. 

'All the same, observations that I have made on my own many journeys 
south have convinced me that the weed itself is not native to our parts of 
the world, but came northward from the lower Anduin, whither it was, I 
suspect, originally brought over Sea by the Men of Westernesse. It grows 
abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger than in the North, 
where it is never found wild, and flourishes only in warm sheltered places 
like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it sweet galenas, and esteem it only 
for the fragrance of its flowers. From that land it must have been carried 
up the Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and 
our own day. But even the D®nedain of Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits 
first put it into pipes. Not even the Wizards first thought of that before 
we did. Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago, and became 
as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.' 




3. Of the Ordering of the Shire 



The Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings already 
referred to. North, South, East, and West; and these again each into a 
number of folklands, which still bore the names of some of the old leading 
families, although by the time of this history these names were no longer 
found only in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in the 
Tookland, but that was not true of many other families, such as the 
Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings were the East and West 
Marches: the Buckland (see beginning of Chapter V, Book I); and the 
Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1462. 

The Shire at this time had hardly any 'government'. Families for the 
most part managed their own affairs. Growing food and eating it occupied 
most of their time. In other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not 
greedy, but contented and moderate, so that estates, farms, workshops, and 
small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations. 

There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high 
king at Fornost, or Norbury as they called it, away north of the Shire. But 
there had been no king for nearly a thousand years, and even the ruins of 
Kings' Norbury were covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits still said of wild 
folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the king. 

For they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually 
they kept the laws of free will, because they were The Rules (as they said), 
both ancient and just. 

It is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent; for the 
office of Thain had passed to them (from the Oldbucks) some centuries 
before, and the chief Took had borne that title ever since. The Thain was 
the master of the Shire-moot, and captain of the Shire-muster and the 
Hobbitry-in-arms, but as muster and moot were only held in times of 
emergency, which no longer occurred, the Thainship had ceased to be more 
than a nominal dignity. The Took family was still, indeed, accorded a 
special respect, for it remained both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and 
was liable to produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar 
habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were 




now rather tolerated (in the rich) than generally approved. The custom 
endured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the family as The Took, 
and of adding to his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim the 
Second, for instance. 

The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor of 
Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was elected every seven years at the 
Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe, that is at Midsummer. As mayor 
almost his only duty was to preside at banquets, given on the 
Shire-holidays, which occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of 
Postmaster and First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he 
managed both the Messenger Service and the Watch. These were the only 
Shire-services, and the Messengers were the most numerous, and much the 
busier of the two. By no means all Hobbits were lettered, but those who were 
wrote constantly to all their friends (and a selection of their relations) 
who lived further off than an afternoon's walk. 

The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their police, or 
the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms 
(such things being quite unknown), only a feather in their caps; and they 
were in practice rather haywards than policemen, more concerned with the 
strayings of beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only twelve 
of them, three in each Farthing, for Inside Work. A rather larger body, 
varying at need, was employed to 'beat the bounds’, and to see that 
Outsiders of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance. 

At the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they were called, 
had been greatly increased. There were many reports and complaints of 
strange persons and creatures prowling about the borders, or over them: the 
first sign that all was not quite as it should be, and always had been 
except in tales and legends of long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even 
Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty years had passed since 
he set out on his memorable journey, and he was old even for Hobbits, who 
reached a hundred as often as not; but much evidently still remained of the 
considerable wealth that he had brought back. How much or how little he 
revealed to no one, not even to Frodo his favourite 'nephew'. And he still 
kept secret the ring that he bad found. 




4. Of the Finding of the Ring 



As is told in The Hobbit , there came one day to Bilbo's door the great 
Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, 
than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in 
exile. With them he set out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning 
of April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great 
treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor 
in Dale, far off in the East. The quest was successful, and the Dragon that 
guarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle 
of Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and many deeds of renown 
were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned 
more than a note in the long annals of the Third Age, but for an 'accident' 
by the way. The party was assailed by Ores in a high pass of the Misty 
Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was 
lost for a while in the black ore-mines deep under the mountains, and there, 
as he groped in vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the 
floor of a tunnel. Ele put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck. 

Trying to find his way out. Bilbo went on down to the roots of the 
mountains, until he could go no further. At the bottom of the tunnel lay a 
cold lake far from the light, and on an island of rock in the water lived 
Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his 
large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish 
with his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate any living thing, even 
ore, if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle. He possessed a 
secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago, when he still lived in 
the light: a ring of gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the one 
thing he loved, his 'precious', and he talked to it, even when it was not 
with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island, except when he 
was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines. 

Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him 
when they met; but it was not, and the hobbit held in his hand an Elvish 
knife, which served him as a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo 
to the Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not 




guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if Bilbo defeated him, then 
he would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels. 

Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor 
back. Bilbo accepted the challenge; and they asked one another many riddles. 
In the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for 
he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand came 
upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten: What haw I got in my pocket? 
This Gollum failed to answer, though he demanded three guesses. 

The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a 
mere 'question' and not a 'riddle' according to the strict rules of the 
Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer, 
Gollum was bound by his promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; 
for 

the thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false, even 
though such promises were held sacred, and of old all but the wickedest 
things feared to break them. But after ages alone in the dark Gollum's heart 
was black, and treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to the 
island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There, 
he thought, lay his ring. He was hungry now, and angry, and once his 
'precious' was with him he would not fear any weapon at all. 

But the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was gone. His 
screech sent a shiver down Bilbo's back, though he did not yet understand 
what had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped to a guess, too late. What 
has it got in its pocketses? he cried. The light in his eyes was like a 
green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his 'precious'. 
Just in time Bilbo saw his peril, and he fled blindly up the passage away 
from the water; and once more he was saved by his luck. For just as he ran 
he put his hand in his pocket, and the ring slipped quietly on to his 
finger. So it was that Gollum passed him without seeing him, and went to 
guard the way out, lest the 'thief should escape. Warily Bilbo followed 
him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself about his 'precious'; 
from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth, and hope came to him 
in the darkness: he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of 
escape from the ores and from Gollum. 

At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the 
lower gates of the mines, on the eastward side of the mountains. There 
Gollum crouched at bay, smelling and listening; and Bilbo was tempted to 




slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, and though he kept the ring, 
in which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill the 
wretched creature at a disadvantage. In the end, gathering his courage, he 
leaped over Gollum in the dark, and fled away down the passage, pursued by 
his enemy's cries of hate and despair: Thief thief! Baggins! We hates it 
for ever! 

Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told 
it to his companions. To them his account was that Gollum had promised to 
give him a present, if he won the game; but when Gollum went to fetch it 
from his island he found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been 
given to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this was the very 
ring that he had found, and as he had won the game, it was already his by 
right. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum 
show him the way out, as a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo 
set down in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, not 
even after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it still appeared in the 
original Red Book, as it did in several of the copies and abstracts. But 
many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no doubt 
from notes by Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though they 
seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old 
hobbit himself. 

Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard 
it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he got 
the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning, which for a while 
strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think the truth 
important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, 
and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the 
first: quite contrary to his habit. The idea of a 'present' was not mere 
hobbitlike invention, all the same. It was suggested to Bilbo, as he 
confessed, by Gollum's talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call 
the ring his 'birthday present', many times. That also Gandalf thought 
strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in this point for 
many more years, as will be seen in this book. 

Of Bilbo's later adventures little more need be said here. With the 
help of the ring he escaped from the ore-guards at the gate and rejoined his 
companions. He used the ring many times on his quest, chiefly for the help 
of his friends; but he kept it secret from them as long as he could. After 




his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf 
and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he 
believed. Only to Frodo did he show the account of his Journey that he was 
writing. 

His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his coat of 
marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon -hoard, he lent to a 
museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer 
at Bag End the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels; and the 
ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his pocket. 

He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in his fifty-second 
year (S.R. 1342), and nothing very notable occurred in the Shire until Mr. 
Baggins began the preparations for the celebration of his 
hundred-and-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point this History 
begins. 




NOTE ON THE SHIRE RECORDS 



At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great 
events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom 
awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and 
many of their traditions, up to that time still mainly oral, were collected 
and Written down. The greater families were also concerned with events in 
the Kingdom at large, and many of their members studied its ancient 
histories and legends. By the end of the first century of the Fourth Age 
there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries that contained 
many historical books and records. 

The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great 
Smials, and at Brandy Hall. This account of the end of the Third Age is 
drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. That most important source 
for 

the history of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long 
preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns, Wardens of the 
Westmarch. 1 It was in origin Bilbo's private diary, which he took with him 
to Rivendell. Frodo brought it back to the Shire, together with many loose 
leaves of notes, and during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages with his 
account of the War. But annexed to it and preserved with it, probably m a 
single red case, were the three large volumes, bound in red leather, that 
Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there was added 
in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other 
matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship. 

The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were 
made, especially of the first volume, for the use of the descendants of the 
children of Master Samwise. The most important copy, however, has a 
different history. It was kept at Great Smials, but it was written in 
Condor, probably at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and 
completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this note: 
Findegil, King's Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It is an exact copy 
in all details of the Thain's Book m Minas Tirith. That book was a copy, 
made at the request of King Elessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and 




was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64. 

The Thain’s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and 
contained much that was later omitted or lost. In Minas Tirith it received 
much annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and 
quotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated 
version of those parts of The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen which lie outside 
the account of the War. The full tale is stated to have been written by 
Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir, some time after the passing of the 
King. But the chief importance of Findegil’s copy is that it alone contains 
the whole of Bilbo's ’Translations from the Elvish'. These three volumes 
were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403 
and 1418, he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both 
living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost 
entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here. 

Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families, 
and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the 
libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear 
in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador 
and the history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or begun by 
Meriadoc 

himself, though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his Herhlore of 
the Shire, and for his Reckoning of Years m which he discussed the relation 
of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and 
Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old Words and Names in the Shire, 
having special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the 
Rohirrim of such 'shire-words' as mathom and old elements in place names. 

At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk, though 
more important for larger history. None of them was written by Peregrin, but 
he and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of 
Gondor: mainly copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to 
Elendil and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive 
materials for the history of N®menor and the arising of Sauron. It was 
probably at Great Smials that The Tale of Years 1 was put together, with the 
assistance of material collected by Meriadoc. Though the dates given are 
often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It 
is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from 
Rivendell, which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond had 




departed, his sons long remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. 
It is said that Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of 
Galadriel; but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey 
Havens, and with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in 
Middle-earth. 




* BOOK I * 



Chapter 1 . A Long-expected Party 

When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be 
celebrating his eleventy -first birthday with a party of special 
magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. 

Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the 
Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and 
unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now 
become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk 
might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with 
treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged 
vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on 
Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they 
began to call him we//-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer the 
mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much 
of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) 
perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. 

'It will have to be paid for,' they said. 'It isn't natural, and 
trouble will come of it!' 

But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with 
his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good 
fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of 
course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among 
the 

hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until 
some of his younger cousins began to grow up. 

The eldest of these, and Bilbo's favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. 
When Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to 
live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally 
dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 
22nd. 

'You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,' said Bilbo one day; 'and 
then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.' At that 




time Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible 
twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three. 

Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively 
combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that 
something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was 
going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number and a very 
respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); 
and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33) an important number: the date of 
his 'coming of age'. 

Tongues began to wag in Flobbiton and By water; and rumour of the coming 
event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo 
Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older 
folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand. 

No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly 
known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush , a small inn on the 
Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden 
at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before 
that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job 
was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son 
were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill 
itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End. 

’A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I've always 
said,' the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to 
him, calling him 'Master Hamfast', and consulting him constantly upon the 
growing of vegetables - in the matter of 'roots', especially potatoes, the 
Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood 
(including himself). 

'But what about this Frodo that lives with him?' asked Old Noakes of 
By water. 'Baggins is his name, but he's more than half a Brandybuck, they 
say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife 
away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.' 

'And no wonder they're queer,' put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer's 
next-door neighbour), 'if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine 
River, and right agin the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half the 
tales be true.' 

'You're right, Dad!' said the Gaffer. 'Not that the Brandybucks of 
Buck-land live in the Old Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They 




fool about with boats on that big river - and that isn’t natural. Small 
wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is 
as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, 
and in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent 
respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of 
him, till he was drownded.' 

'Drownded?' said several voices. They had heard this and other darker 
rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, 
and they were ready to hear it again. 'Well, so they say,' said the Gaffer. 

'You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was 
our 

Mr. Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest 
of the Old Took's daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. 
Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying 
is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Flail with his 
father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him 
being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous 
table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife 
were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all. ' 

'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said 
Old Noakes; 'and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.' 

'And / heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,' said 
Sandy man, the Hobbiton miller. 

'You shouldn't listen to all you hear, Sandyman,' said the Gaffer, who 
did not much like the miller. 'There isn't no call to go talking of pushing 
and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without 
looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo 
left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer 
Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by 
all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred 
relations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he 
brought the lad back to live among decent folk. 

'But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They 
thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was 
thought to be dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes 
on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly 
he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The 




Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to 
be hoped not.' 

'There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,' said a 
stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. 

'All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and 
silver, and jools, by what I've heard. ' 

'Then you've heard more than I can speak to,' answered the Gaffer. I 
know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems 
no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel -making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came 
back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I'd not long come 
prentice to old Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at Bag 
End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the 
garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up 
the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I 
don't doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign 
parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn't enough 
to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He's in and out 
of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all 
Mr. Bilbo's tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters - meaning no harm, 
mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it. 

'Elves and Dragons' Isays to him. 'Cabbages and potatoes are better 
for me and you. Don 't go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, 
or you'll land in trouble too big for you, ' I says to him. And I might say 
it to others,' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller. 

But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo's 
wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of 
hobbits. 

'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,' 
argued the miller, voicing common opinion. 'He's often away from home. And 
look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and 
that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, 
Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.' 

'And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you 
do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,' retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even 
more than usual. If that's being queer, then we could do with a bit more 
queerness in these parts. There's some not far away that wouldn't offer a 
pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But 




they do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone's going to be 
invited to the party, and there’s going to be presents, mark you, presents 
for all - this very month as is.' 

That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or 
two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread 
about that there were going to be fireworks - fireworks, what is more, such 
as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since 
the Old Took died. 

Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with 
odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill 
to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. 

It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long 
beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the end of the 
second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction 
of the Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all 
alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver 
scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond 
the brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through 
Hobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly 
guessed. At Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great 
bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red 
G and the elf-rune, . 

That was Gandalf s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the 
Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, 
smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, 
but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one of the 
'attractions' at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. 'G 
for Grand!' they shouted, and the old man smiled. They knew him by sight, 
though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but 
neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his 
firework displays - they now belonged to the legendary past. 

When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished 
unloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker 
was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers. 

'Run away now!' said Gandalf. 'You will get plenty when the time 
comes.' Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was shut. The 
young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, 




feeling that the day of the party would never come. 

Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a 
small room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoon was bright 
and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and 
sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in 
at the round windows. 

'How bright your garden looks!' said Gandalf. 

'Yes,' said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old 
Shire; but I think I need a holiday.' 

'You mean to go on with your plan then?' 

'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven't changed it.' 

'Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan - your 
whole plan, mind - and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and 
for all of us.' 

'I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my 
little joke.' 

'Who will laugh, I wonder?' said Gandalf, shaking his head. 

'We shall see,' said Bilbo. 

The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There 
might have been some grumbling about 'dealing locally', but that very week 
orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, 
or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the 
neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the 
days on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for 
invitations. 

Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton 
post-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and 
voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a constant stream of 
them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you, 

I shall certainly come. 

A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT 
ON PARTY 

BUSINESS. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were 
seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off 
answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his 
own. From the time of Gandalf s arrival he remained hidden from view. 

One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo's 




front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special 
entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a 
large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, 
adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old 
Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden. 

The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big 
that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood proudly 
near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its 
branches. More promising still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous open-air 
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. A draught of cooks, 
from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the 
dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose 
to its height. 

Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the 
Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually 
dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun 
began. 

Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of 
entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was 
invited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned up all 
the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the Shire 
were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo 
met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. Ele gave away 
presents to all and sundry - the latter were those who went out again by a 
back way and came in again by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other 
people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not 
so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in 
Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebody’s birthday, so 
that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present 
at least once a week. But they never got tired of them. 

On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children 
were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were 
toys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some 
obviously magical. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and 
had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of real 
dwarf-make. 

When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, 




there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink. 
There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But 
lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the 
guests were sitting down and eating together. At other times there were 
merely lots of people eating and drinking - continuously from elevenses 
until six-thirty, when the fireworks started. 

The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but 
designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights 
of rockets were let off by him. But there was also a generous distribution 
of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, 
elf-fountains, goblin -barkers and thunder -claps. They were all superb. The 
art of Gandalf improved with age. 

There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with 
sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves 
opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches 
dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with 
a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were 
fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were 
pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing 
ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a 
shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang 
suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down 
again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was 
also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits 
exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went 
up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow 
at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red -golden 
dragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his 
eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the 
heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The 
dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over 
Bywater with a deafening explosion. 

That is the signal for supper!' said Bilbo. The pain and alarm 
vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There was 
a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited 
to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with 
the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called 




by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use 
of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which 
Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated 
friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by 
parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the 
matter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting 
them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender. 

There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and 
Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins' 
grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and 
selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, 
Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly 
connected 

with Bilbo, and some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as 
they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not 
forgotten. Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and 
detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in 
golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their 
cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years and his table 
had a high reputation. 

All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; 
though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an 
inevitable item). Fie was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry; 
and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to the absurd adventures 
of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very 
pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, 
and prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout 
the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo's catering had depleted the 
stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not 
matter much. 

After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company 
were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they 
called ’filling up the corners’. They were sipping their favourite drinks, 
and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. 

They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop. 

My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. ’Flear! Flear! Hear!’ 
they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to 




follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair 
under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming 
face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could 
all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the other was in his 
trouser -pocket. 

My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooks and 
Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, 
and 

Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots. 

'ProudFEET!' 

shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of 
course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally 
furry, and both were on the table. 

Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I 
welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh 
birthday: I am eleventy -one today!' Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!' 
they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was doing 
splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious. 

I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening 
cheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and 
flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many 
young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of 
them bore the mark DALE on them; which did not convey much to most of 
the 

hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained 
instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one 
corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to 
have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up 
an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took 
and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands 
began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous. 

But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he 
blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. / shall not keep you long, he 
cried. Cheers from all the assembly. / have called you all together for a 
Purpose. Something in the way that he said this made an impression. There 
was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears. 

Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am 




immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time 
to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of 
approval. 

/ don 't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less 
than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather 
difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying 
to work it out and see if it came to a compliment. 

Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR 
birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, 

Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory 
clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of ’Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old 
Frodo,' from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what 
was meant by 'coming into his inheritance'. Together we score one hundred 
and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One 
Gross, if I may use the expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of 
his guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling 
sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in 
a package. 'One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.' 

It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the 
anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the 
fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only 
fifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was 
very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and 
could only say 'thagyou very buch'. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank 
you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence. They all 
feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting 
bored. Why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo 
did not sing or recite. Fie paused for a moment. 

Thirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. Fie 
spoke 

this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. 

I regret to announce that - though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too 
short a time to spend among you - this is the END. I am going. I am leaving 
NOW. GOOD-BYE 7 

He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and 
the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be 
seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. 




Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then there 
was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every 
Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, 
Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to 
talk 

at once. 

It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more 
food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. 'He's 
mad. I always said so,' was probably the most popular comment. Even the 
Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. For the 
moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing 
more than a ridiculous prank. 

But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous 
dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: 
'There's something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off 
again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn't taken the vittles with him.' 

He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again. 

Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he 
had sat silent beside Bilbo's empty chair, and ignored all remarks and 
questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in 
the know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant 
surprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he 
realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests 
went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins' oddities, past and 
present; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo 
did not want to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more 
wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the 
health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion. 

As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been 
fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept 
secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger, 
and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again. 

He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening 
with a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in 
other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes, 
folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and 
put it away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened 




round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a 
battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of 
moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if 
they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that 
their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark 
green. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his study, and 
from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a 
leather -bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. The book and 
bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there, 
already nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its 
fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put 
it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his 
pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in. 

'Hullo!' said Bilbo. 'I wondered if you would turn up.' 

'I am glad to find you visible,' replied the wizard, sitting down in a 
chair, 'I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel 
that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?' 

'Yes, I do,' said Bilbo. "Though that flash was surprising: it quite 
startled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, I 
suppose?' 

It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it 
seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to 
explain your sudden vanishment.' 

'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,' laughed 
Bilbo, 'but I expect you know best, as usual.' 

'I do - when I know anything. But I don't feel too sure about this 
whole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have had your joke, 
and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the whole Shire 
something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you 
going any further?' 

'Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have 
told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don't expect I shall 
return. In fact, I don't mean to, and I have made all arrangements. 

'I am old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in 
my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!' he snorted. 'Why, I feel all 
thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been 
scraped over too much bread. That can't be right. I need a change, or 




something.' 

Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. 'No, it does not seem 
right,' he said thoughtfully. 'No, after all I believe your plan is probably 
the best.' 

'Well, I've made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, 
Gandalf, mountains, and then find somewhere where I can rest. In peace and 
quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded 
visitors hanging on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my 
book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived happily ever 
after to the end of his days. ' 

Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however 
it ends.' 

'Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as 
it has gone. You'll keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?' 

'Yes, I will - two eyes, as often as I can spare them.' 

'He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered 
to once, just before the party. But he does not really want to, yet. I want 
to see the wild country again before I die, and the Mountains; but he is 
still in love with the Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. He 
ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course, 
except a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he gets used to being 
on his own. It's time he was his own master now.' 

'Everything?' said Gandalf. 'The ring as well? You agreed to that, you 
remember.' 

'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,' stammered Bilbo. 

'Where is it?' 

'In an envelope, if you must know,' said Bilbo impatiently. 'There on 
the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!' He hesitated. 'Isn't 
that odd now?' he said softly to himself. 'Yet after all, why not? Why 
shouldn't it stay there?' 

Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his 
eyes. 'I think, Bilbo,' he said quietly, 'I should leave it behind. Don't 
you want to?' 

'Well yes - and no. Now it comes to it, I don't like parting with it at 
all, I may say. And I don't really see why I should. Why do you want me to?' 
he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. It was sharp with 




suspicion and annoyance. 'You are always badgering me about my ring; but 
you 

have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.' 

'No, but I had to badger you,' said Gandalf. 'I wanted the truth. It 
was important. Magic rings are - well, magical; and they are rare and 
curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I 
still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also 
I think you have had it quite long enough. You won't need it any more. 
Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.' 

Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly 
face grew hard. 'Why not?' he cried. 'And what business is it of yours, 
anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It 
came to me.' 

'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But there is no need to get angry.' 

'If I am it is your fault,' said Bilbo. 'It is mine, I tell you. My 
own. My precious. Yes, my precious.' 

The wizard's face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in 
his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. 'It has been 
called that before,' he said, 'but not by you.' 

'But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It's 
not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.' 

Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. 'You will be a fool if you do. 

Bilbo,' he said. 'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got 
far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be 
free.' 

'I'll do as I choose and go as I please,' said Bilbo obstinately. 

'Now, now, my dear hobbit! ' said Gandalf. 'All your long life we have 
been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it 
up! ' 

'Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!' cried Bilbo. 'But you 
won't get it. I won't give my precious away, I tell you.' His hand strayed 
to the hilt of his small sword. 

Gandalf s eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said. 

If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey 
uncloaked.' He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall 
and menacing; his shadow filled the little room. 

Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at 




his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the air of the 
room tingled. Gandalf s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands 
relaxed, and he began to tremble. 

'I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,' he said. 'You have 
never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn't it? I 
found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn't kept it. I'm not a 
thief, whatever he said.' 

'I have never called you one,' Gandalf answered. 'And I am not one 
either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust 
me, as you used.' He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to 
dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled. 

Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,' he said. 'But I felt so 
queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any 
more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was 
like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and 
disappear, don't you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to 
make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn't rest without it in 
my pocket. I don't know why. And I don't seem able to make up my mind.' 

'Then trust mine,' said Gandalf. 'It is quite made up. Go away and 
leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after 
him.' 

Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. 'All 
right,' he said with an effort. I will.' Then he shrugged his shoulders, and 
smiled rather ruefully. 'After all that's what this party business was all 
about, really: to give away lots of birthday presents, and somehow make it 
easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn't made it any easier in the 
end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite 
spoil the joke.' 

'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,' 
said Gandalf. 

'Very well,' said Bilbo, 'it goes to Frodo with all the rest.' He drew 
a deep breath. 'And now I really must be starting, or somebody else will 
catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn't bear to do it all over 
again.' He picked up his bag and moved to the door. 

'You have still got the ring in your pocket,' said the wizard. 'Well, 
so I have!' cried Bilbo. 'And my will and all the other documents too. You 
had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.' 




'No, don’t give the ring to me,' said Gandalf. 'Put it on the 
mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait 
for him.' 

Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the 
clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. Before he 
could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. 

A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit's face again. Suddenly it 
gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. 'Well, that's that,' he said. 'Now 
I'm off!' 

They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the 
stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of different rooms where 
they had been busy. 

'Is everything ready?' asked Bilbo. 'Everything packed and labelled?' 

'Everything,' they answered. 

'Well, let's start then!' He stepped out of the front-door. 

It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked 
up, sniffing the air. 'What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the Road 
with dwarves ! This is what I have really been longing for, for years ! 
Good-bye! ' he said, looking at his old home and bowing to the door. 
'Good-bye, Gandalf!' 

'Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old 
enough, and perhaps wise enough.' 

'Take care! I don't care. Don't you worry about me! I am as happy now 
as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. 

I am being swept off my feet at last,' he added, and then in a low voice, as 
if to himself, he sang softly in the dark: 

The Road goes ever on and on 

Down from the door where it began. 

Now far ahead the Road has gone, 

And I must follow, if I can, 

Pursuing it with eager feet, 

Until it joins some larger way 

Where many paths and errands meet. 

And whither then? I cannot say. 

He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned 
away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his 
three companions went round into his garden, and trotted down the long 




sloping path. He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and 
took to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the 
grass. 

Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness. 
’Goodbye, my dear Bilbo - until our next meeting!' he said softly and went 
back indoors. 

Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep 
in thought. 'Has he gone?' he asked. 

'Yes,' answered Gandalf, 'he has gone at last.' 

' I wish - 1 mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,' 
said Frodo. 'But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. He always 
used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just to 
see him off.' 

I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,' said 
Gandalf. 'Don't be too troubled. He'll be all right - now. He left a packet 
for you. There it is!' 

Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but 
did not open it. 

'You'll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,' 
said the wizard. 'You are the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, 
you'll find a golden ring.' 

'The ring!' exclaimed Frodo. 'Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, 
it may be useful.' 

'It may, and it may not,' said Gandalf. 'I should not make use of it, 
if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.' 

As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to 
the guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field, 
but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the 
morning. About midnight carriages came for the important folk. One by one 
they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners 
came by arrangement, and removed in wheel-barrows those that had 
inadvertently remained behind. 

Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. 
Morning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away the 
pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives and 
bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and 
the crumbs and cracker -paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and 




handkerchiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number of 
other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and 
Tooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when 
even the best-fed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at Bag 
End, uninvited but not unexpected. 

Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and 
worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more to say than 
before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: 'Mr. Bilbo Baggins has 
gone away; as far as I know, for good.' Some of the visitors he invited to 
come inside, as Bilbo had left 'messages' for them. 

Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and 
parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item there was a label 
tied. There were several labels of this sort: 

For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, on an umbrella. 
Adelard 

had carried off many unlabelled ones. 

For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love 
from 

Bilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo's sister and the eldest 
surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had 
written reams of good advice for more than half a century. 

For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B., on a gold pen 
and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters. 

For ANGELICA'S use, from Uncle Bilbo, on a round convex mirror. She 
was 

a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely. 

For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor, on an 
(empty) book -case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual 
at returning them. 

For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT, on a case of 
silver 

spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, 
while he was away on his former journey. Fobelia knew that quite well. When 
she arrived later in the day, she took the point at once, but she also took 
the spoons. 

This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo's 
residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long 




life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the 
custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, of 
course, that the birthday-presents were always new, there were one or two 
old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; 
but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and kept those that he received. 
The old hole was now being cleared a little. 

Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out 
personally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, of 
course, most of the things were given where they would be wanted and 
welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot Row, did very 
well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen 
waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory 
Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old 
Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as 
it had been laid down by Bilbo's father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted 
him a capital fellow after the first bottle. 

There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the 
chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than enough 
furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however, no sign nor 
mention of money or jewellery: not a penny -piece or a glass bead was given 
away. 

Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the 
whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before 
long the place was packed with people who had no business there, but could 
not be kept out. Fabels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some 
people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off 
with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed 
unwanted or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and 
handcarts. 

In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo 
had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye 
on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely. 

'He is indisposed,' he said. 'He is resting.' 

'Hiding, you mean,' said Fobelia. 'Anyway we want to see him and we 
mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!' 

Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover 
their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually 




they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of 
papers in front of him. He looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at 
any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he 
spoke quite politely. 

The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering 
him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and 
unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things specially 
directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very 
fishy. 

'Only one thing is clear to me,' said Otho, 'and that is that you are 
doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.' 

Otho would have been Bilbo's heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. He 
read the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and 
correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other 
things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink). 

'Foiled again!' he said to his wife. 'And after waiting sixty years. 

Spoons? Fiddlesticks!' He snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and slumped 
off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out 
of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the 
place, investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors. He escorted 
her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but 
rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her 
face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing 
parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was: 

'You'll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn't you go too? You 
don't belong here; you're no Baggins - you - you're a Brandybuck!' 

'Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,' said Frodo 
as he shut the door on her. 

'It was a compliment,' said Merry Brandybuck, 'and so, of course, not 
true.' 

Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two 
Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the 
cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo 
Proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, 
where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both 
curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not 
positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one's for the finding 




-unless the search is interrupted. 

When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on 
chair in the hall. It's time to close the shop, Merry,' he said. 'Lock the 
door, and don’t open it to anyone today, not even if they bring a battering 
ram.’ Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea. 

He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. 
'Lobelia again most likely,' he thought. 'She must have thought of something 
really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.' 

He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but he 
took no notice. Suddenly the wizard's head appeared at the window. 

'If you don't let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your 
hole and out through the hill,' he said. 

'My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!' cried Frodo, running out of the room 
to the door. 'Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.' 

'Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap 
towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.' 

'She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo's 
ring. I longed to disappear.' 

'Don't do that!' said Gandalf, sitting down. 'Do be careful of that 
ring, Frodo ! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last 
word.' 

'Well, what about it?' 

'What do you know already?' 

'Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and 
how he used it: on his journey, I mean.' 

'Which story, I wonder,' said Gandalf. 

'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,' said Frodo. 'He 
told me the true story soon after I came to live here. He said you had 
pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. "No secrets between 
us, Frodo," he said; "but they are not to go any further. It's mine 
anyway.'" 

'That's interesting,' said Gandalf. 'Well, what did you think of it 
all?' 

'If you mean, inventing all that about a "present", well, I thought the 
true story much more likely, and I couldn't see the point of altering it at 
all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I thought it rather 
odd.' 




'So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures 
- if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. 

It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.' 

'I don't understand,' said Frodo. 

'Neither do I,' answered the wizard. 'I have merely begun to wonder 
about the ring, especially since last night. No need to worry. But if you 
take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least I beg 
you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say 
again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!' 

'You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?' 

'I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you 
something when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for 
the present.' He got up. 

'At once!' cried Frodo. 'Why, I thought you were staying on for at 
least a week. I was looking forward to your help.' 

'I did mean to - but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a 
good while; but I'll come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me 
when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan't often be visiting the 
Shire openly again. I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I 
am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actually 
accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is 
supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.' 

'Some people!' exclaimed Frodo. 'You mean Otho and Lobelia. How 
abominable! I would give them Bag End and everything else, if I could get 
Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him. I love the Shire. 
But I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever 
see him again.' 

'So do I,' said Gandalf. 'And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! 
Take care of yourself! Lookout for me, especially at unlikely times ! 
Good-bye!' 

Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked 
off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually 
bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing 
in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not 
see him again for a long time. 




Chapter 2 . The Shadow of the Past 



The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety -nine days. The second 
disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all 
over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than 
that. It became a fireside -story for young hobbits; and eventually Mad 
Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags 
of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long 
after all the true events were forgotten. 

But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that 
Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and 
had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a 
river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was 
mostly laid on Gandalf. 

'If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps 
he'll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,' they said. And to all 
appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the 
growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to 
carry on Bilbo's reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and 
the next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo's hundred-and-twelfth 
birthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was short of the 
mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which 
it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say. 

Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving 
Bilbo's Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it. He said 
that he did not think Bilbo was dead. When they asked: 'Where is he then?' 
he shrugged his shoulders. 

He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, 
especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) 
who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End. 
Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends 
were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real 
name was Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping 
all 

over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the 
amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in 




the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he 
visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done. 

As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of 
good ’preservation': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and 
energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. ’Some folk have all the luck,’ they 
said; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of 
fifty that they began to think it queer. 

Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master 
and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was 
quite happy and did not worry much about the future. But half unknown to 
himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing. He 
found himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild 
lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his 
dreams. He began to say to himself: 'Perhaps I shall cross the River myself 
one day.' To which the other half of his mind always replied: 'Not yet.' 

So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth 
birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow 
significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had 
suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths 
seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond 
their edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its 
borders. He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and 
Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking 
and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in 
the Shire. 

There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; 
and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several 
years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the 
Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, 
passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no 
longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road 
in unusual numbers. The ancient East -West Road ran through the Shire to its 
end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their 
mines in the Blue Mountains. They were the hobbits' chief source of news 
from distant parts - if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and 
hobbits asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far 
countries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in 




whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor. 

That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a 
shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and 
disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out 
by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old 
strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From 
there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south 
there were wars and growing fear. Ores were multiplying again in the 
mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed 
with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more 
terrible than all these, but they had no name. 

Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. 

But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and 
those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. The 
conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of 
Frodo's fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the 
Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them. 

Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him 
was Ted Sandyman, the miller's son; and there were various other rustic 
hobbits listening to their talk. 

’Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,' said Sam. 

'Ah,' said Ted, 'you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales 
and children's stories at home, if I want to.' 

'No doubt you can,' retorted Sam, 'and I daresay there's more truth in 
some of them than you reckon. Who invented the stories anyway? Take 
dragons 
now.' 

'No thank 'ee,' said Ted, 'I won't. I heard tell of them when I was a 
youngster, but there's no call to believe in them now. There's only one 
Dragon in By water, and that's Green,' he said, getting a general laugh. 

'All right,' said Sam, laughing with the rest. 'But what about these 
Tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say that one bigger 
than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.' 

'Who's theyT 

'My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up 
to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.' 

'Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal's always saying he's seen things; and 




maybe he sees things that ain't there.' 

'But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven 
yards to a stride, if it was an inch.' 

'Then I bet it wasn't an inch. What he saw was an elm tree, as like as 
not.' 

'But this one was walking, I tell you; and there ain't no elm tree on 
the North Moors.' 

'Then Hal can't have seen one,' said Ted. There was some laughing and 
clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point. 

'All the same,' said Sam, 'you can't deny that others besides our 
Halfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire - crossing it, mind you: 
there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders have never 
been so busy before. 

'And I've heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are 
going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers.' Sam waved his 
arm 

vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the 
old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire. But it was an old 
tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times 
elven-ships set sail, never to return. 

'They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into 
the West and leaving us,' said Sam, half chanting the words, shaking his 
head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed. 

'Well, that isn't anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I 
don't see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrant you 
haven't seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire.' 

'Well I don't know,' said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once 
seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day. Of all the 
legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and 
half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always 
moved him most deeply. 'There are some, even in these parts, as know the 
Fair Folk and get news of them,' he said. 'There's Mr. Baggins now, that I 
work for. He told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves. 
And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many's the talk I had with him when I was a 
little lad.' 

'Oh, they're both cracked,' said Ted. 'Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, 
and Frodo's cracking. If that's where you get your news from, you'll never 




want for moonshine. Well, friends, I'm off home. Your good health!' He 
drained his mug and went out noisily. 

Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For 
one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have 
a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But 
Sam had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up 
and went out. 

It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The 
sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night. He 
walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill, 
whistling softly and thoughtfully. 

It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long 
absence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then he paid 
Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again. 
During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming 
unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He 
would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly 
interested in small news about Frodo's health and doings. 

Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo 
had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would 
never return and had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as 
Sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar 
tap on the study window. 

Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They 
looked hard at one another. 

’Ah well eh?' said Gandalf. 'You look the same as ever, Frodo!' 

'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked 
older and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide 
world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the 
night. 

Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo 
by the open window of the study. A bright fire was on the hearth, but the 
sun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Everything looked fresh, and 
the new green of Spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the 
trees' fingers. 

Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when 
Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps 




whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps 
longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as 
bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke -rings with the same vigour and 
delight. 

He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in 
thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings 
that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence. 

'Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, 

Gandalf,' he said. 'And then you stopped, because you said that such matters 
were best left until daylight. Don't you think you had better finish now? 

You say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than I guess. In what 
way?' 

'In many ways,' answered the wizard. It is far more powerful than I 
ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it would utterly 
overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him. 

'In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you 
call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more potent and 
some less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was 
full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles - yet still to my 
mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they 
were perilous. 

'A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but 
he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last 
every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the Ring to make himself 
invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks 
in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes, 
sooner or later - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but 
neither strength nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power 
will devour him.' 

'How terrifying!' said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound 
of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden. 

'How long have you known this?' asked Frodo at length. 'And how much 
did Bilbo know?' 

'Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,' said Gandalf. 'He 
would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would 
be a danger, even though I promised to look after you. He thought the ring 
was very beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or 




queer, it was himself. He said that it was "growing on his mind", and he was 
always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to 
blame. Though he had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did 
not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd 
way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.' 

'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,' said Frodo, 'so I have 
always kept it on its chain.' 

'Very wise,' said Gandalf. 'But as for his long life, Bilbo never 
connected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit for that to 
himself, and he was very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and 
uneasy. Thin and stretched he said. A sign that the ring was getting 
control.' 

'How long have you known all this?' asked Frodo again. 

'Known?' said Gandalf. 'I have known much that only the Wise know, 
Frodo. But if you mean "known about this ring", well, I still do not know, 
one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess. 

'When did I first begin to guess?' he mused, searching back in memory. 

'Let me see - it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power 
from Mirkwood, just before the Battle of Five Armies, that Bilbo found his 
ring. A shadow fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I 
feared. I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was 
- that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo's strange story 
of how he had "won" it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the 
truth out of him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to 
the ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his "birthday present". The 
lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had an unwholesome 
power that set to work on its keeper at once. That was the first real 
warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were 
better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little 
else that I could do. I could not take it from him without doing greater 
harm; and I had no right to do so anyway. I could only watch and wait. I 
might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held 
me 
back.' 

'Who is he?' asked Frodo. I have never heard of him before.' 

'Maybe not,' answered Gandalf. 'Hobbits are, or were, no concern of 
his. Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the 




head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, 
and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, 
is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their 
making; but when the Rings were debated in the Council, all that he would 
reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept - but 
uneasily. Still I watched and I waited. 

'And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, they 
passed, and they seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs of age. The 
shadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: "After all he comes of a 
long-lived family on his mother's side. There is time yet. Wait!" 

'And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said and 
did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of Saruman could 
allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have 
spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.' 

'There wasn't any permanent harm done, was there?' asked Frodo 
anxiously. 'He would get all right in time, wouldn't he? Be able to rest in 
peace, I mean?' 

'He felt better at once,' said Gandalf. 'But there is only one Power in 
this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I 
know there is no Power in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the 
Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of 
knowledge, but full of surprises. Soft as butter they can be, and yet 
sometimes as tough as old tree-roots. I think it likely that some would 
resist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would believe. I don't 
think you need worry about Bilbo. 

'Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it 
might take a long while for the influence to wear off - before it was safe 
for him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live on for 
years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with it. For he 
gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I was not 
troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the thing go. It is for 
you that I feel responsible. 

'Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you, and 
about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a grievous 
blow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all your kind, 
jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not 
to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.' 




Frodo shuddered. 'But why should we be?' he asked. 'And why should he 
want such slaves?' 

'To tell you the truth,' replied Gandalf, 'I believe that hitherto - 
hitherto, mark you - he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits. 

You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does not need you - 
he has many more useful servants - but he won't forget you again. And 
hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and 
free. There is such a thing as malice and revenge.' 

'Revenge?' said Frodo. 'Revenge for what? I still don't understand what 
all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.' 

'It has everything to do with it,' said Gandalf. 'You do not know the 
real peril yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I was last 
here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for a moment.' 

Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain 
that hung from his belt. He unfastened it and handed it slowly to the 
wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in 
some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it. 

Gandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold. 'Can 
you see any markings on it?' he asked. 

'No,' said Frodo. 'There are none. It is quite plain, and it never 
shows a scratch or sign of wear.' 

'Well then, look!' To Frodo's astonishment and distress the wizard 
threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire. Frodo 
gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back. 

'Wait!' he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from 
under his bristling brows. 

No apparent change came over the ring. After a while Gandalf got up, 
closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains. The room 
became dark and silent, though the clack of Sam's shears, now nearer to the 
windows, could still be heard faintly from the garden. For a moment the 
wizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to 
the hearth with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped. 

It is quite cool,' said Gandalf. 'Take it!' Frodo received it on his 
shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever. 

'Hold it up!' said Gandalf. 'And look closely!' 

As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest 
pen-strokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that 




seemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone piercingly 
bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth. 

I cannot read the fiery letters,' said Frodo in a quavering voice. 

'No,' said Gandalf, 'but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancient 
mode, but the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. But 
this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough: 

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, 

One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. 

It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore: 

Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, 

Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, 

Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, 

One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne 
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. 

One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them, 

One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them 
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. ' 

He paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: 'This is the 
Master -ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he 
lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He greatly desires 
it - but he must not get it.' 

Frodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast 
hand, like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf him. 
'This ring!' he stammered. 'How, how on earth did it come to me?' 

'Ah!' said Gandalf. 'That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back 
in the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember. If I were to 
tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when Spring had 
passed into Winter. 

'But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord. The 
rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again and left 
his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark Tower 
of Mordor. That name even you hobbits have heard of, like a shadow on the 
borders of old stories. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow 
takes another shape and grows again.' 

'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 

'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But 




that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the 
time that is given, us. And already, Frodo, our time is beginning to look 
black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from ripe, 

I think, but they are ripening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be 
very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance. 

'The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to 
beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover all the lands 
in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring. 

'The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and his hand 
never touched them or sullied them. Seven the Dwarf-kings possessed, but 
three he has recovered, and the others the dragons have consumed. Nine he 
gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago they 
fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows 
under his great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a 
year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows 
once 

more, they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such things 
even in the morning of the Shire. 

'So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or 
else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that no longer 
troubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that Ring himself, it is 
his, and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it, so that 
he could rule all the others. If he recovers it, then he will command them 
all again, wherever they be, even the Three, and all that has been wrought 
with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever. 

'And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the One had 
perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been done. But he 
knows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking 
it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it. It is his great hope and 
our great fear.' 

'Why, why wasn't it destroyed?' cried Frodo. 'And how did the Enemy 
ever come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so precious to him?' 

He clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers 
stretching out to seize it. 

'It was taken from him,' said Gandalf. 'The strength of the Elves to 
resist him was greater long ago; and not all Men were estranged from them. 
The Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is a chapter of ancient 




history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and 
gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. 

One day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in 
full by one who knows it best. 

'But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing 
came to you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that I will say. It 
was Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, 
though they themselves perished in the deed; and Isildur Elendil's son cut 
the Ring from Sauron's hand and took it for his own. Then Sauron was 
vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years, until his 
shadow took shape again in Mirkwood. 

'But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, and 
vanished. For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of the River, 
and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Ores of the Mountains, and 
almost all his folk were slain. He leaped into the waters, but the Ring 
slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Ores saw him and killed him 
with arrows.' 

Gandalf paused. 'And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields,' 
he said, 'the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of 
its history is known now only to a few, and the Council of the Wise could 
discover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think. 

'Fong after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the 
Great River on the edge of Wilderland a clever -handed and quiet-footed 
little people. I guess they were of hobbit -kind; akin to the fathers of the 
fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or 
made little boats of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute, 
for it was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother 
of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they had. The most 
inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Smjagol. He was 
interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed 
under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he 
ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers 
opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward. 

'He had a friend called Djagol, of similar sort, sharper -eyed but not 
so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden 
Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. There 
Smjagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deal sat in the boat and 




fished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, and before he knew where he 
was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to the bottom. Then he let 
go of his line, for he thought he saw something shining in the river-bed; 
and holding his breath he grabbed at it. 

'Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful of 
mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away, 
there 

in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the 
sun, so that his heart was glad. But Smjagol had been watching him from 
behind a tree, and as Deal gloated over the ring, Smjagol came softly up 
behind. 

"'Give us that, Deal, my love," said Smjagol, over his friend's 
shoulder. 

'"Why?" said Deal. 

' "Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it," said Smjagol. 

'"I don't care," said Deal. "I have given you a present already, more 
than I could afford. I found this, and I'm going to keep it." 

' "Oh, are you indeed, my love," said Smjagol; and he caught Deal by 
the throat and strangled him, because the gold looked so bright and 
beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger. 

'No one ever found out what had become of Deal; he was murdered far 
from home, and his body was cunningly hidden. But Smjagol returned alone; 
and he found that none of his family could see him, when he was wearing the 
ring. He was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it; and he 
used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and 
malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was 
hurtful. The ring had given him power according to his stature. It is not to 
be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when 
visible) 

by all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He took to 
thieving, and going about muttering to himself, and gurgling in his throat. 

So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and 
his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him 
out of her hole. 

'He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of the 
world, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to a stream that flowed 
down from the mountains, and he went that way. He caught fish in deep pools 




with invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as he 
was bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head) and a 
dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he 
had almost forgotten about the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and 
shook his fist at her. 

'But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above the tops of the Misty 
Mountains, out of which the stream came. And he thought suddenly: "It would 
be cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there. 
The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great 
secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning." 

’So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little 
cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot 
into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge. The Ring 
went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had 
begun 

to grow again, could learn nothing of it.' 

'Gollum!' cried Frodo. 'Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very 
Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!' 

'I think it is a sad story,' said the wizard, 'and it might have 
happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.' 

'I can't believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however 
distantly,' said Frodo with some heat. 'What an abominable notion!' 

'It is true all the same,' replied Gandalf. 'About their origins, at 
any rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo's story 
suggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the background of their 
minds and memories that was very similar. They understood one another 
remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a 
Dwarf, or an Ore, or even an Elf. Think of the riddles they both knew, for 
one thing.' 

'Yes,' said Frodo. 'Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and 
of much the same sort. And hobbits don't cheat. Gollum meant to cheat all 
the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard. And I daresay 
it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him 
with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.' 

'Only too true, I fear,' said Gandalf. 'But there was something else in 
it, I think, which you don't see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly ruined. He 
had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed -as a hobbit 




might. There was a little corner of his mind that was still his own, and 
light came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the 
past. It was actually pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again, 
bringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun on the grass, and such 
forgotten things. 

'But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in 
the end - unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.' Gandalf 
sighed. 'Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope. No, 
not though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far back as he can 
remember. For it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness 
it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never "faded". He is thin and tough 
still. But the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had 
become almost unbearable. 

'All the "great secrets" under the mountains had turned out to be just 
empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only 
nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He was altogether wretched. 
He hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the 
Ring most of all.' 

'What do you mean?' said Frodo. 'Surely the Ring was his precious and 
the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn't he get rid of 
it, or go away and leave it?' 

'You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,' 
said Gandalf. 'He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He 
could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter. 

'A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off 
treacherously, but its keeper never abandons it. At most he plays with the 
idea of handing it on to someone else's care - and that only at an early 
stage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilbo alone in 
history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. He needed all my 
help, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken it, or cast it 
aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things. 

The Ring left him. ' 

'What, just in time to meet Bilbo?' said Frodo. 'Wouldn't an Ore have 
suited it better?' 

'It is no laughing matter,' said Gandalf. 'Not for you. It was the 
strangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far: Bilbo's arrival 
just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark. 




'There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to 
get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur's hand and betrayed him; 
then when a chance came it caught poor Deal, and he was murdered; and after 
that Gollum, and it had devoured him. It could make no further use of him: 
he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never 
leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and 
sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to 
be 

picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire! 

'Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the 
Ring-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant to 
find the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case you also were meant to 
have it. And that maybe an encouraging thought.' 

It is not,' said Frodo. "Though I am not sure that I understand you. 

But how have you learned all this about the Ring, and about Gollum? Do you 
really know it all, or are you just guessing still?' 

Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. I knew much and I have 
learned much,' he answered. 'But I am not going to give an account of all my 
doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known 
to all the Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire- writing 
alone, apart from any other evidence.' 'And when did you discover that?' 
asked Frodo, interrupting. 'Just now in this room, of course,' answered the 
wizard sharply. 'But I expected to find it. I have come back from dark 
journeys and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof, and 
all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum's part, and fitting it into the 
gap in the history, required some thought. I may have started with guesses 
about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.' 

'You have seen Gollum?' exclaimed Frodo in amazement. 

'Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried long 
ago; but I have managed it at last.' 

'Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?' 

'Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to 
tell - though not, of course, in the way I have reported it. Gollum is a 
liar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the Ring his 
"birthday present", and he stuck to that. He said it came from his 
grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. A ridiculous 
story. I have no doubt that Smjagol's grandmother was a matriarch, a great 




person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elven-rings was 
absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of 
truth. 

'The murder of Deal haunted Gollum, and he had made up a defence, 
repeating it to his "precious" over and over again, as he gnawed bones in 
the dark, until he almost believed it. It was his birthday. Deal ought to 
have given the ring to him. It had previously turned up just so as to be a 
present. It was his birthday present, and so on, and on. 

I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately 
important, and in the end I had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him, 
and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much 
snivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood and ill-used. But 
when he had at last told me his history, as far as the end of the 
Riddle-game and Bilbo's escape, he would not say any more, except in dark 
hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was 
going to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, 
and driven into a hole and then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good 
friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That 
was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What is more, he 
knew where he came from.' 

'But how did he find that out?' asked Frodo. 

'Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself; and 
after that it would not be difficult to discover his country, once Gollum 
came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring proved stronger than 
his fear of the Ores, or even of the light. After a year or two he left the 
mountains. You see, though still bound by desire of it, the Ring was no 
longer devouring him; he began to revive a little. He felt old, terribly 
old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry. 

'Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always 
will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide from daylight and 
moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his 
pale cold eyes, and catch small frightened or unwary things. He grew 
stronger and bolder with new food and new air. He found his way into 
Mirkwood, as one would expect.' 

'Is that where you found him?' asked Frodo. 

'I saw him there,' answered Gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered 
far, following Bilbo's trail. It was difficult to learn anything from him 




for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats. 

"What had it got in its pocketses?" he said. "It wouldn't say, no precious. 

Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, it did. It broke the 
rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. And we will, precious!" 

’That is a sample of his talk. I don't suppose you want any more. I had 
weary days of it. But from hints dropped among the snarls I even gathered 
that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth, and even to the 
streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well, the news of the great 
events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo's name and 
knew where he came from. We had made no secret of our return journey to his 
home in the West. Gollum's sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.' 

'Then why didn't he track Bilbo further?' asked Frodo. 'Why didn't he 
come to the Shire?' 

'Ah,' said Gandalf, 'now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set 
out and came back westward, as far as the Great River. But then he turned 
aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else 
drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me. 

'The Wood -elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail 
was still fresh then. Through Mirkwood and back again it led them, though 
they never caught him. The wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful 
tales even among beasts and birds. The Woodmen said that there was some 
new 

terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it 
crept into holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find 
cradles. 

'But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered 
off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves' ken, and was lost. And then 
I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may 
prove the worst. I let the matter be. I let him go; for I had much else to 
think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman. 

'Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and 
dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took it up again, after Bilbo 
left here. And my search would have been in vain, but for the help that I 
had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age 
of the world. Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of 
Wilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given 
up the chase and turned to other parts, Gollum was found. My friend returned 




out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him. 

’What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and called us 
cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined 
and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they 
pained him, as if he remembered some old torture. But I am afraid there is 
no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by 
mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.' 

A heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating. 

Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam's shears could now be 
heard. 

’Yes, to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, 
and the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather them there. The Ring 
of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And 
all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred 
of the West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his 
revenge ! 

'Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his 
comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would 
be caught, and taken - for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When 
he was found he had already been there long, and was on his way back. On 
some errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst 
mischief was done. 

'Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been 
found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his 
ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that 
it is not one of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they endure 
no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are 
accounted for. He knows that it is the One. And he has at last heard, I 
think, of hobbits and the Shire. 

'The Shire - he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found 
out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think that the 
long -unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.' 

'But this is terrible!' cried Frodo. 'Far worse than the worst that I 
imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I 
to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo 
did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!' 

'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike 




without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so 
little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his 
ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.' 

'I am sorry,' said Frodo. 'But I am frightened; and I do not feel any 
pity for Gollum.' 

'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in. 

'No, and I don't want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do you 
mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those 
horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Ore, and just an enemy. 
He deserves death.' 

'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some 
that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to 
deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I 
have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a 
chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells 
me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and 
when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not 
least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. 

The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as 
they can find in their wise hearts.' 

'All the same,' said Frodo, 'even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I 
wish he had not kept the Ring. I wish he had never found it, and that I had 
not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn't you make me throw it 
away, or, or destroy it?' 

'Let you? Make you?' said the wizard. 'Haven't you been listening to 
all that I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying. But as 
for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of 
being found. In evil hands it might have done great evil. Worst of all, it 
might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. Indeed it certainly would; 
for this is the One, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it 
to himself. 

'Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has 
troubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had to take some 
risk - though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the 
Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I 
did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for 
evil, not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine 




years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.' 

'But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?' 
cried Frodo again. If you had warned me, or even sent me a message, I would 
have done away with it.' 

'Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?' 

'No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.' 

'Try!' said Gandalf. Try now!' 

Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. It now 
appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he could see. The 
gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was 
its colour, how perfect was its roundness. It was an admirable thing and 
altogether precious. When he took it out he had intended to fling it from 
him into the very hottest part of the fire. But he found now that he could 
not do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed the Ring in his hand, 
hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; 
and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away - 
but he found that he had put it back in his pocket. 

Gandalf laughed grimly. 'You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily 
let it go, nor will to damage it. And I could not "make" you - except by 
force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking the Ring, force is 
useless. Even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it 
would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine. 

'Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This 
Ring has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. But there 
is no smith's forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the 
anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that 
dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now 
any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there 
ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the 
One 

Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself. There is only 
one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the 
Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, 
to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.' 

'I do really wish to destroy it!' cried Frodo. 'Or, well, to have it 
destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the 
Ring ! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?' 




’Such questions cannot be answered,' said Gandalf. 'You may be sure 
that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power or 
wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use 
such strength and heart and wits as you have.' 

'But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and 
powerful. Will you not take the Ring?' 

'No!' cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. 'With that power I should 
have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gain a power 
still greater and more deadly.' His eyes flashed and his face was lit as by 
a fire within. 'Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark 
Lord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for 
weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not 
take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too 
great, for my strength. I shall have such need of it. Great perils lie 
before me.' 

He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. 
Sunlight streamed back again into the room. Sam passed along the path 
outside whistling. 'And now,' said the wizard, turning back to Frodo, 'the 
decision lies with you. But I will always help you.' He laid his hand on 
Frodo's shoulder. 'I will help you bear this burden, as long as It is yours 
to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.' 

There was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his 
pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he 
was watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the 
hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down 
into profound wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom 
and the terror of the Fiery Mountain. 

'Well!' said Gandalf at last. 'What are you thinking about? Have you 
decided what to do?' 

'No!' answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and 
finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he 
could see the sunlit garden. 'Or perhaps, yes. As far as I understand what 
you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the 
present, whatever it may do to me.' 

'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with 
that purpose,' said Gandalf. 

'I hope so,' said Frodo. 'But I hope that you may find some other 




better keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger, a 
danger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and stay here. I 
ought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.’ He 
sighed. 

'I should like to save the Shire, if I could - though there have been 
times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have 
felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. 
But I don't feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies 
behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall 
know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand 
there again. 

'Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that 
as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo's or better, ending 
in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, 
drawing it after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and 
save the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well - 
desperate. The Enemy is so strong and terrible.' 

He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to 
follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart - to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to 
find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost 
have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo had done 
on a similar morning long ago. 

'My dear Frodo!' exclaimed Gandalf. 'Hobbits really are amazing 
creatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is to know 
about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still 
surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get such an answer, not even 
from you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little 
thought how important it would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring 
will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer; and for your own 
sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of 
Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or 
in the Wild. I will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. 
Underhill. 

'But I don't think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can 
trust, and who would be willing to go by your side - and that you would be 
willing to take into unknown perils. But if you look for a companion, be 
careful in choosing! And be careful of what you say, even to your closest 




friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.' 

Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all was 
very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one side of the window. 
Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and 
downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee's curly head 
hauled by 
one ear. 

'Well, well, bless my beard!' said Gandalf. 'Sam Gamgee is it? Now what 
may you be doing?' 

'Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!' said Sam. 'Nothing! Leastways I was 
just trimming the grass-border under the window, if you follow me.' He 
picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence. 

'I don't,' said Gandalf grimly. It is some time since I last heard the 
sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?' 

'Eavesdropping, sir? I don't follow you, begging your pardon. There 
ain't no eaves at Bag End, and that's a fact.' 

'Don't be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?' 
Gandalf s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles. 

'Mr. Frodo, sir!' cried Sam quaking. 'Don't let him hurt me, sir! Don't 
let him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad would take on so. I 
meant no harm, on my honour, sir!' 

'He won't hurt you,' said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, 
although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. 'He knows, as well as I 
do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight 
away!' 

'Well, sir,' said Sam dithering a little. 'I heard a deal that I didn't 
rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir, and 
dragons, and a fiery mountain, and - and Elves, sir. I listened because I 
couldn't help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do 
love tales of that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say. 
Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see them. Couldn't you take me to see 
Elves, sir, when you go?' 

Suddenly Gandalf laughed. 'Come inside!' he shouted, and putting out 
both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, 
right through the window and stood him on the floor. 'Take you to see Elves, 
eh?' he said, eyeing Sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his face. 

'So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?' 




'I did, sir. And that's why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I 
tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.' 

'It can't be helped, Sam,' said Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized 
that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely 
saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End. 'I shall have to go. 
But' - and here he looked hard at Sam - 'if you really care about me, you 
will keep that dead secret. See? If you don't, if you even breathe a word of 
what you've heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted 
toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.' 

Sam fell on his knees, trembling. 'Get up, Sam!' said Gandalf. I have 
thought of something better than that. Something to shut your mouth, and 
punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!' 

'Me, sir!' cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. 'Me 
go and see Elves and all! Hooray!' he shouted, and then burst into tears. 




Chapter 3 . Three is Company 



'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,' said Gandalf. Two 
or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to 

go- 

'I know. But it is difficult to do both,' he objected. If I just vanish 
like Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in no time.' 

'Of course you mustn't vanish!' said Gandalf. 'That wouldn't do at all! 

I said soon, not instantly. If you can think of any way of slipping out of 
the Shire without its being generally known, it will be worth a little 
delay. But you must not delay too long.' 

'What about the autumn, on or after Our Birthday?' asked Frodo. 'I 
think I could probably make some arrangements by then.' 

To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come 
to the point. Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than it had for 
years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the 
Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart would think 
more kindly of journeying, as it always did at that season. He had indeed 
privately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo's one 
hundred and twenty-eighth. It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set 
out and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one 
thing that made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as little as 
possible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. But he did 
not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessed was always 
difficult to tell. 

He looked at Frodo and smiled. 'Very well,' he said. 'I think that will 
do - but it must not be any later. I am getting very anxious. In the 
mean-while, do take care, and don't let out any hint of where you are going! 
And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him 
into a toad.' 

'As for where I am going,' said Frodo, 'it would be difficult to give 
that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.' 

'Don't be absurd!' said Gandalf. 'I am not warning you against leaving 
an address at the post-office! But you are leaving the Shire - and that 
should not be known, until you are far away. And you must go, or at least 




set out, either North, South, West or East - and the direction should 
certainly not be known.' 

'I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End, and of 
saying farewell, that I have never even considered the direction,' said 
Frodo. 'For where am I to go? And by what shall I steer? What is to be my 
quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back again; but I go to lose 
one, and not return, as far as I can see.' 

'But you cannot see very far,' said Gandalf. 'Neither can I. It may be 
your task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be for others: I do 
not know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.' 

'No indeed!' said Frodo. 'But in the meantime what course am I to 
lake?' 

'Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,' answered the 
wizard. 'If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey should not 
prove too perilous, though the Road is less easy than it was, and it will 
grow worse as the year fails.' 

'Rivendell!' said Frodo. 'Very good: I will go east, and I will make 
for Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.' He 
spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the 
house of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep valley where 
many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace. 

One summer's evening an astonishing piece of news reached the Ivy Bush 
and Green Dragon. Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were 
forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End, indeed 
he had already sold it - to the Sackville-Bagginses! 

'For a nice bit, loo,' said some. 'At a bargain price,' said others, 

'and that's more likely when Mistress Fobelia's the buyer.' (Otho had died 
some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.) 

Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more 
debatable than the price. A few held the theory - supported by the nods and 
hints of Mr. Baggins himself - that Frodo's money was running out: he was 
going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale 
down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. 'As far from the 
Sackville-Bagginses as may be,' some added. But so firmly fixed had the 
notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that 
most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason 
that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet 




unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go 
about by day, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in the Bag End'. But 
however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was 
no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland. 

'Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,' he said. 'Merry Brandybuck is 
looking out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.' 

As a matter of fact with Merry's help he had already chosen and bought 
a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all but 
Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision 
to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on the 
eastern borders of the Shire, and as he had lived there in childhood his 
going back would at least seem credible. 

Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months. Then one evening, at 
the end of June, soon after Frodo's plan had been finally arranged, he 
suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning. 'Only for a 
short while, I hope,' he said. 'But I am going down beyond the southern 
borders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.' 

He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried. 

'Has anything happened?' he asked. 

'Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs 
looking into. If I think it necessary after all for you to get off at once, 

I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick 
to your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the Ring. Fet me 
impress on you once more: don't use it!' 

He went off at dawn. 'I may be back any day,' he said. 'At the very 
latest I shall come back for the farewell party. I think after all you may 
need my company on the Road.' 

At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what 
Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine 
weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire had seldom seen so 
fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey 
was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full. 

Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf 
again. September was passing and there was still no news of him. The 
Birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he did not come, or send 
word. Bag End began to be busy. Some of Frodo's friends came to stay and 
help him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and 




of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between 
them 

they turned the whole place upside-down. 

On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland, 
conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home, 
by way of the Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became really anxious, 
and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning, 
dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbo's great party. Still 
Gandalf did not appear. In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was 
quite small, just a dinner for himself and his four helpers; but he was 
troubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought that he would so soon have 
to part with his young friends weighed on his heart. He wondered how he 
would break it to them. 

The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party 
soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf s absence. The dining-room was 
bare except for a table and chairs, but the food was good, and there was 
good wine: Frodo's wine had not been included in the sale to the 
Sackville-Bagginses. 

’Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s get their 
claws on it, at any rate I have found a good home for this!' said Frodo, as 
he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards. 

When they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done 
together, they toasted Bilbo's birthday, and they drank his health and 
Frodo's together according to Frodo's custom. Then they went out for a sniff 
of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed. Frodo's party 
was over, and Gandalf had not come. 

The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder 
of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove off with Fatty (that is 
Fredegar Bolger). 'Someone must get there and warm the house before you 
arrive,' said Merry. 'Well, see you later - the day after tomorrow, if you 
don't go to sleep on the way!' 

Folco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodo was 
restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf. He decided 
to wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he 
would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first. For Frodo was going 
on foot. His plan - for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any 
other reason - was to walk from Hobbiton to Bucklebury Ferry, taking it 




fairly easy. 

'I shall get myself a bit into training, too,' he said, looking at 
himself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. He had not done any 
strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection looked rather flabby, 
he thought. 

After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, 
Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo's annoyance. 'Ours at last!' said Lobelia, 
as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of 
Bag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be 
forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years longer for 
Bag End than she once hoped, and she was now a hundred years old. 
Anyway, 

she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and 
she wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought 
a complete inventory with her and went right through it. In the end she 
departed with Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key 
would be left at the Gamgees' in Bagshot Row. She snorted, and showed 
plainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole during 
the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea. 

He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen. It had 
been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland 'to do for Mr. 
Frodo and look after his bit of garden'; an arrangement that was approved by 
the Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia 
as a neighbour. 

'Our last meal at Bag End!' said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They 
left the washing up for Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped up their three 
packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for a last stroll in the 
garden. Sam disappeared. 

The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. 
Frodo 

wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on 
the walls, and shadows creep out of the corners. It grew slowly dark 
indoors. He went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path, 
and then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half expected to see Gandalf 
come striding up through the dusk. 

The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. 'It's going to be 
a fine night,' he said aloud. 'That's good for a beginning. I feel like 




walking. I can't bear any more hanging about. I am going to start, and 
Gandalf must follow me.' He turned to go back, and then slopped, for he 
heard voices, just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was 
certainly the old Gaffer's; the other was strange, and somehow unpleasant. 

He could not make out what it said, but he heard the Gaffer's answers, which 
were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out. 

'No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Sam went 
with 

him: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out and gone, I tell'ee. Why? 
Why's none of my business, or yours. Where to? That ain't no secret. He's 
moved to Bucklebury or some such place, away down yonder. Yes it is - a tidy 
way. I've never been so far myself; they're queer folks in Buckland. No, I 
can't give no message. Good night to you!' 

Footsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact 
that they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief. 'I am sick of 
questions and curiosity about my doings, I suppose,' he thought. 'What an 
inquisitive lot they all are!' He had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer 
who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and 
walked quickly back to Bag End. 

Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo 
stepped inside the dark door. 'Sam!' he called. 'Sam! Time!' 

'Coming, sir!' came the answer from far within, followed soon by Sam 
himself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell to the beer -barrel in 
the cellar. 

'All aboard, Sam?' said Frodo. 

'Yes, sir. I'll last for a bit now, sir.' 

Frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam. 'Run 
down with this to your home, Sam!' he said. 'Then cut along the Row and meet 
us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows. We are 
not going through the village tonight. Too many ears pricking and eyes 
prying.' Sam ran off at full speed. 

'Well, now we're off at last!' said Frodo. They shouldered their packs 
and took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to the west side of 
Bag End. 'Good-bye!' said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows. He 
waved 

his hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he had known it) hurried 
after Peregrin down the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in the 




hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a 
rustle in the grasses. 

At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate 
opening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted the straps of 
their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard; 
his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head 
a tall shapeless fell bag, which he called a hat. In the gloom he looked 
very much like a dwarf. 

'I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,' said Frodo. 'I 
pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.' 

'I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,' said Sam 
stoutly and untruthfully. 

'No, you don't, Sam!' said Pippin. 'It is good for him. He's got 
nothing except what he ordered us to pack. He's been slack lately, and he'll 
feel the weight less when he's walked off some of his own.' 

'Be kind to a poor old hobbit!' laughed Frodo. 'I shall be as thin as a 
willow-wand, I'm sure, before I get to Buckland. But I was talking nonsense. 

I suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, and I shall look into it 
at our next packing.' He picked up his stick again. 'Well, we all like 
walking in the dark,' he said, 'so let's put some miles behind us before 
bed.' 

For a short way they followed the lane westwards. Then leaving it they 
turned left and took quietly to the fields again. They went in single file 
along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them. 
In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings. 

Since they were all hobbits, and were trying to be silent, they made no 
noise that even hobbits would hear. Even the wild things in the fields and 
woods hardly noticed their passing. 

After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow 
plank -bridge. The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon, 
bordered with leaning alder -trees. A mile or two further south they hastily 
crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge; they were now in the 
Tookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the Green Hill Country. 
As they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps 
in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water. Soon it 
disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by By water 
beside its grey pool. When the light of the last farm was far behind, 




peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell. 

'I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,' he said 
quietly. 

When they had walked for about three hours they rested. The night was 
clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the 
hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in 
a light wind above their heads, made a black net against the pale sky. They 
ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again. Soon they 
struck a narrow road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the 
darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry. 
It climbed away from the main road in the Water -valley, and wound over the 
skirts of the Green Hills towards Woody-End, a wild corner of the 
Eastfarthing. 

After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall 
trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was very dark. At first 
they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from 
inquisitive ears. Then they marched on in silence, and Pippin began to lag 
behind. At last, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and 
yawned. 

'I am so sleepy,' he said, 'that soon I shall fall down on the road. 

Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.' 

'I thought you liked walking in the dark,' said Frodo. 'But there is no 
great hurry. Merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow; but that 
leaves us nearly two days more. We'll halt at the first likely spot.' 

'The wind's in the West,' said Sam. 'If we get to the other side of 
this hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough, sir. 

There is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly.' Sam knew the 
land well within twenty miles of Hobbiton, but that was the limit of his 
geography. 

Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood. 

Leaving the road they went into the deep resin-scented darkness of the 
trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a 
merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it 
for a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an angle of the great 
tree's roots, they curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and were soon 
fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo feared no danger yet, for they 
were still in the heart of the Shire. A few creatures came and looked at 




them when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business 
of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed. 

'Hobbits!' he thought. 'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings 
in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors 
under a tree. Three of them! There's something mighty queer behind this.' He 
was quite right, but he never found out any more about it. 

The morning came, pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that 
a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff. 

'Walking for pleasure! Why didn't I drive?' he thought, as he usually 
did at the beginning of an expedition. 'And all my beautiful feather beds 
are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would do them good.' 

He stretched. 'Wake up, hobbits!' he cried. It's a beautiful morning.' 

'What's beautiful about it?' said Pippin, peering over the edge of his 
blanket with one eye. 'Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you 
got the bath-water hot?' 

Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. 'No, sir, I haven't, sir!' he 
said. 

Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then 
walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out 
of the mists that lay thick on the world. Touched with gold and red the 
autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below 
him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared. 

When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!' 
shouted Pippin. 'Where's the water?' 

'I don't keep water in my pockets,' said Frodo. 'We thought you had 
gone to find some,' said Pippin, busy setting out the food, and cups. 'You 
had better go now.' 

'You can come too,' said Frodo, 'and bring all the water-bottles.' 

There was a stream at the foot of the hill. They filled their bottles and 
the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet 
over an outcrop of grey stone. It was icy cold; and they spluttered and 
puffed as they bathed their faces and hands. 

When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it 
was after ten o'clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. They 
went down the slope, and across the stream where it dived under the road, 
and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by 
that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, and other gear already seemed 




a heavy burden. 

The day's march promised to be warm and tiring work. After some miles, 
however, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a 
steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to go down 
for the last time. In front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with 
small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland 
haze. They were looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine 
River. 

The road wound away before them like a piece of string. 

’The road goes on for ever,' said Pippin; 'but I can't without a rest. 

It is high time for lunch.' He sat down on the bank at the side of the road 
and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end 
of the Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him. His round 
eyes were wide open - for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a 
new horizon. 

'Do Elves live in those woods?' he asked. 

'Not that I ever heard,' said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was 
gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before. Suddenly 
he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly: 

The Road goes ever on and on 
Down from the door where it began. 

Now far ahead the Road has gone, 

And I must follow, if I can, 

Pursuing it with weary feet, 

Until it joins some larger way, 

Where many paths and errands meet. 

And whither then? I cannot say. 

'That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo's rhyming,' said Pippin. 'Or is it 
one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.' 

'I don't know,' said Frodo. It came to me then, as if I was making it 
up; but I may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds me very much of 
Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was 
only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every 
doorstep, and every path was its tributary. "It's a dangerous business, 
Frodo, going out of your door," he used to say. "You step into the Road, and 
if you don't keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept 
off to. Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through 




Mirkwood, and that if you let it, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain 
or even further and to worse places?" He used to say that on the path 
outside the front door at Bag End, especially after he had been out for a 
long walk.' 

'Well, the Road won’t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,' said 
Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example, putting their 
packs against the bank and their legs out into the road. After a rest they 
had a good lunch, and then more rest. 

The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the 
land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road. 
This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little 
traffic to the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour or 
more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now on level 
ground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through 
grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods. 

'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said Sam. 

They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing 
far. 'I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as 
he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide 
from the view of the rider came over him. 

'It may not matter much,' he said apologetically, 'but I would rather 
not be seen on the road - by anyone. I am sick of my doings being noticed 
and discussed. And if it is Gandalf,' he added as an afterthought, 'we can 
give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. Let's get out 
of sight!' 

The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not 
far from the road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second: 
curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide. The 
sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of 
long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head 
and peered cautiously above one of the great roots. 

Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized 
horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle, 
wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his boots in the high 
stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible. 

When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped. 

The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From 




inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive 
scent; the head turned from side to side of the road. 

A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he 
thought of his Ring. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get 
it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. 

He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe. The 
advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. 'And I am still in 
the Shire,' he thought, as his hand touched the chain on which it hung. At 
that moment the rider sat up, and shook the reins. The horse stepped 
forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot. 

Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he 
dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him 
that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and 
went into the trees on the right. 

'Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said Frodo to 
himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin and Sam had remained 
flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and 
his strange behaviour. 

'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me; 
and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me. I've never 
seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.' 

'But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?' said Pippin. 

'And what is he doing in this part of the world?' 

'There are some Men about,' said Frodo. 'Down in the Southfarthing they 
have had trouble with Big People, I believe. But I have never heard of 
anything like this rider. I wonder where he comes from.' 

'Begging your pardon,' put in Sam suddenly, 'I know where he comes 
from. It's from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there's 
more than one. And I know where he's going to.' 

'What do you mean?' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. 
'Why didn't you speak up before?' 

'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to 
our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: Hello, Sam! 
he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There's been a 
strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and he's only just gone. 
I've sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that Hiked the sound of him. He seemed 
mighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had left his old home for good. 




Hissed at me, he did. It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was 
he? says I to the Gaffer. / don 't know, says he; but he wasn 't a hobbit. He 
was tall and black-like, and he stooped aver me. I reckon it was one of the 
Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny. 

'I couldn't stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and I 
didn't give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting old, and more than 
a bit blind, and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the 
Hill and found him taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope he hasn't 
done no harm, sir, nor me.' 

'The Gaffer can't be blamed anyway,' said Frodo. 'As a matter of fact I 
heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inquiring for me, and I 
nearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about 
it before. I might have been more careful on the road.' 

'Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer's 
stranger,' said Pippin. 'We left Hobbiton secretly enough, and I don't see 
how he could have followed us.' 

'What about the smelling, sir?' said Sam. 'And the Gaffer said he was a 
black chap.' 

'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,' Frodo muttered. 'But perhaps it 
would only have made matters worse.' 

'Then you know or guess something about this rider?' said Pippin, who 
had caught the muttered words. 

'I don't know, and I would rather not guess,' said Frodo. 'All right, 
cousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for the present, if you want to be 
mysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a bite and a 
sup, but somehow I think we had better move on from here. Your talk of 
sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.' 

'Yes, I think we will move on now,' said Frodo; 'but not on the road 
-in case that rider comes back, or another follows him. We ought to do a 
good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.' 

The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they 
started off again. They now kept a stone's throw to the left of the road, 
and kept out of sight of it as much as they could. But this hindered them; 
for the grass was thick and tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the trees 
began to draw together into thickets. 

The sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, and evening 
was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level 




over which it had run straight for some miles. At that point it bent left 
and went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for Stock; but a lane 
branched right, winding through a wood of ancient oak-trees on its way to 
Woodhall. 'That is the way for us,' said Frodo. 

Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it 
was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out 
round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and 
could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road. The 
hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed 
wood. They rested and had a light meal, talking quietly and listening from 
time to time. 

Twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind 
was sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon the road began to 
fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A star came out above the trees in 
the darkening East before them. They went abreast and in step, to keep up 
their spirits. After a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the 
feeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened for the sound of 
hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk 
along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With most 
hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a 
walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). 
Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, 
and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water -valley and 
talked about Adventure. 

Upon the hearth the fire is red, 

Beneath the roof there is a bed; 

But not yet weary are our feet, 

Still round the corner we may meet 
A sudden tree or standing stone 
That none have seen but we alone. 

Tree and flower and leaf and grass, 

Let them pass! Let them pass! 

Hill and water under sky, 

Pass them by! Pass them by! 



Still round the corner there may wait 
A new road or a secret gate, 




And though we pass them by today, 

Tomorrow we may come this way 
And take the hidden paths that run 
Towards the Moon or to the Sun. 

Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe, 

Let them go! Let them go! 

Sand and stone and pool and dell, 

Fare you well! Fare you well! 

Home is behind, the world ahead, 

And there are many paths to tread 
Through shadows to the edge of night, 

Until the stars are all alight. 

Then world behind and home ahead, 

We'll wander back to home and bed. 

Mist and twilight, cloud and shade, 

Away shall fade! Away shall fade! 

Fire and lamp, and meat and bread, 

And then to bed! And then to bed! 

The song ended. 'And now to bed! And now to bed!' sang Pippin in a high 
voice. 

'Hush!' said Frodo. 'I think I hear hoofs again.' 

They slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. 

There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and 
clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran 
into the deeper shade under the oak-trees. 

'Don't let us go too far!' said Frodo. 'I don't want to be seen, but I 
want to see if it is another Black Rider.' 

'Very well!' said Pippin. 'But don't forget the sniffing!' 

The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better 
than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a 
large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane. It 
showed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood. Above it the 
stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon. 

The sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass 
across the lighter space between two trees, and then halt. It looked like 
the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow. The black shadow 




stood close to the point where they had left the path, and it swayed from 
side to side. Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling. The shadow bent 
to the ground, and then began to crawl towards him. 

Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time 
it was stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he realized what 
he was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket. But at that moment there 
came a sound like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in 
the starlit air. The black shadow straightened up and retreated. It climbed 
on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the 
darkness on the other side. Frodo breathed again. 

'Elves!' exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. 'Elves, sir!' He would have 
burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if they had not 
pulled him back. 

'Yes, it is Elves,' said Frodo. 'One can meet them sometimes in the 
Woody End. They don't live in the Shire, but they wander into it in Spring 
and Autumn, out of their own lands away beyond the Tower Hills. I am 
thankful that they do! You did not see, but that Black Rider stopped just 
here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he 
heard the voices he slipped away.' 

'What about the Elves?' said Sam, too excited to trouble about the 
rider. 'Can't we go and see them?' 

'Listen! They are coming this way,' said Frodo. 'We have only to wait.' 

The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above the others. It was 
singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo knew only a little, and the 
others knew nothing. Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape 
itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood. This 
was the song as Frodo heard it: 



Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear! 
O Queen beyond the Western Seas! 

O Light to us that wander here 



Amid the world of woven trees! 



Gilthoniel! O Elbereth! 

Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath! 
Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee 
In a far land beyond the Sea. 




O stars that in the Sunless Year 

With shining hand by her were sawn, 

In windy fields now bright and clear 

We see your silver blossom blown! 

O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! 

We still remember, we who dwell 

In this far land beneath the trees, 

Thy starlight on the Western Seas. 

The song ended. These are High Elves! They spoke the name of 
Elbereth!' said Frodo in amazement, 'Few of that fairest folk are ever seen 
in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth, east of the Great Sea. 
This is indeed a strange chance!' 

The hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. Before long the Elves came 
down the lane towards the valley. They passed slowly, and the hobbits could 
see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes. They bore no 
lights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like the light of the moon above the 
rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were 
now silent, and as the last Elf passed he turned and looked towards the 
hobbits and laughed. 

'Hail, Frodo!' he cried. 'You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps 
lost?' Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stopped and 
gathered round. 

'This is indeed wonderful!' they said. 'Three hobbits in a wood at 
night! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What is the 
meaning of it?' 

'The meaning of it, fair people,' said Frodo, 'is simply that we seem 
to be going the same way as you are. I like walking under the stars. But I 
would welcome your company.' 

'But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,' they 
laughed. 'And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do 
not 

know whither we are going?' 

'And how do you know my name?' asked Frodo in return. 

'We know many things,' they said. 'We have seen you often before with 
Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.' 

'Who are you, and who is your lord?' asked Frodo. 




'I am Gildor,' answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him. 

'Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod. We are Exiles, and most of our 
kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a 
while, ere we return over the Great Sea. But some of our kinsfolk dwell 
still in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us what you are doing? 

For we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you.' 

'O Wise People!' interrupted Pippin eagerly. ’Tell us about the Black 
Riders!' 

'Black Riders?' they said in low voices. 'Why do you ask about Black 
Riders?' 

'Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, or one has done so 
twice,' said Pippin; 'only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew 
near.' 

The Elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in their 
own tongue. At length Gildor turned to the hobbits. 'We will not speak of 
this here,' he said. 'We think you had best come now with us. It is not our 
custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and you shall lodge 
with us tonight, if you will.' 

'O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,' said Pippin. Sam 
was speechless. 'I thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,' said Frodo bowing. 
'Elen snla l®menn' omentielvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,' he 
added in the high-elven speech. 

'Be careful, friends!' cried Gildor laughing. 'Speak no secrets! Here 
is a scholar in the Ancient Tongue. Bilbo was a good master. Hail, 
Elf-friend!' he said, bowing to Frodo. 'Come now with your friends and join 
our company! You had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray. You 
may be weary before we halt.' 

'Why? Where are you going?' asked Frodo. 

'For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some 
miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will shorten your 
journey tomorrow.' 

They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint 
lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished 
without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered 
once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and 
saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo's side, as if in a dream, 
with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy. 




The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and 
thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, 
there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. At 
last the Elves turned aside from the path. A green ride lay almost unseen 
through the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away 
back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that 
stood out into the lower land of the river -valley. Suddenly they came out of 
the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of grass, grey 
under the night. On three sides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the 
ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of 
the slope, were below their feet. Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat 
under the stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of 
Woodhall. 

The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they 
seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits. Frodo and his companions 
wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them. 
The night grew on, and the lights in the valley went out. Pippin fell 
asleep, pillowed on a green hillock. 

Away high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and slowly 
above the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some 
shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up, 
as he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky, 
Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst into song. Suddenly 
under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light. 

'Come!' the Elves called to the hobbits. 'Come! Now is the time for 
speech and merriment!' 

Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. 'There is a fire in the 
hall, and food for hungry guests,' said an Elf standing before him. 

At the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There the 
green floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space like a hall, 
roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each 
side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars 
torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat 
round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks. Some 
went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink; others brought food on 
heaped plates and dishes. 

'This is poor fare,' they said to the hobbits; 'for we are lodging in 




the greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we 
will treat you better.' 

'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said Frodo. 

Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind 
was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so 
various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered 
that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who 
is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended 
fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, 
cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon. 

Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what 
he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory as one of 
the chief events of his life. The nearest he ever got was to say: 'Well, 
sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener. But 
it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.' 

Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was 
chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened 
eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in 
their own language. They smiled at him and said laughing: 'Here is a jewel 
among hobbits!' 

After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away 
to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the 
rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master. When Pippin had 
gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and 
closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor. 

They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questioned Gildor 
much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were 
mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of Men, and the 
flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to 
his heart: 

'Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?' 

Gildor smiled. 'Yes,' he answered. 'Twice. He said farewell to us on 
this very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.' He would say no 
more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent. 

'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,' said 
Gildor. 'But I already know a little, and I can read more in your face and 
in the thought behind your questions. You are leaving the Shire, and yet you 




doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or 
that you will ever return. Is not that so?' 

'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to 
Gandalf and my faithful Sam.' He looked down at Sam, who was snoring 
gently. 

'The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,' said Gildor. 

'The Enemy?' said Frodo. 'Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?' 

'I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,' answered 
Gildor; 'but I perceive that he is - strange indeed though that seems to me. 

And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon 
either side.' 

'You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of the Enemy. 
What are the Black Riders?' 

'Has Gandalf told you nothing?' 

'Nothing about such creatures.' 

'Then I think it is not for me to say more - lest terror should keep 
you from your journey. For it seems to me that you have set out only just in 
time, if indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, and neither stay 
nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you.' 

'I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your 
hints and warnings,' exclaimed Frodo. 'I knew that danger lay ahead, of 
course; but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire. Can't a hobbit 
walk from the Water to the River in peace?' 

'But it is not your own Shire,' said Gildor. 'Others dwelt here before 
hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The 
wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for 
ever fence it out.' 

'I know - and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I 
do now? My plan was to leave the Shire secretly, and make my way to 
Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland.' 

'I think you should still follow that plan,' said Gildor. 'I do not 
think the Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire 
clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the reason for your 
flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail 
you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you will see him before 
you leave the Shire?' 

'I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have 




been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come to Hobbiton at 
the 

latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared. Now I am wondering what 
can have happened. Should I wait for him?’ 

Gildor was silent for a moment. 'I do not like this news,' he said at 
last. 'That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it is said: Do 
not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to 
anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.' 

'And it is also said,' answered Frodo: 'Go not to the Elves for 
counsel, for they will say both no and yes. ' 

'Is it indeed?' laughed Gildor. 'Elves seldom give unguarded advice, 
for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all 
courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning 
yourself; and how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand 
advice, I will for friendship's sake give it. I think you should now go at 
once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I 
also advise this: do not go alone. Take such friends as are trusty and 
willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly. 

The Elves have their own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little 
concerned with the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. 

Our paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting there 
may be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and I fear to 
say too much.' 

'I am deeply grateful,' said Frodo; 'but I wish you would tell me 
plainly what the Black Riders are. If I take your advice I may not see 
Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that 
pursues me.' 

'Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?' 
answered Gildor. 'Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are deadly. Ask no 
more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of 
Drogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion. May 
Elbereth protect you!' 

'But where shall I find courage?' asked Frodo. 'That is what I chiefly 
need.' 

'Courage is found in unlikely places,' said Gildor. 'Be of good hope! 

Sleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our messages 




through the lands. The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey, 
and 

those that have power for good shall be on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; 
and may the stars shine upon the end of your road! Seldom have we had such 
delight in strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech 
from the lips of other wanderers in the world.' 

Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. 'I 
will sleep now,' he said; and the Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and 
he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber. 




Chapter 4 . A Short Cut to Mushrooms 



In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a 
living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of 
fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. The sun was shining 
through the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon the tree. He 
jumped up and went out. 

Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippin was 
standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the Elves. 

'They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,' said Pippin. 'Come and 
have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I 
did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.' 

Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. 'What is the plan for 
today?' asked Pippin. 

'To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,' answered Frodo, and 
gave his attention to the food. 

'Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?' asked Pippin 
cheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of 
them did not seem very alarming to him. 

'Yes, probably,' said Frodo, not liking the reminder. 'But I hope to 
get across the river without their seeing us.' 

'Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?' 

'Not much - only hints and riddles,' said Frodo evasively. 'Did you ask 
about the sniffing?' 

'We didn't discuss it,' said Frodo with his mouth full. 

'You should have. I am sure it is very important.' 

'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,' said 
Frodo sharply. 'And now leave me in peace for a bit! I don't want to answer 
a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!' 

'Good heavens!' said Pippin. 'At breakfast?' He walked away towards the 
edge of the green. 

From Frodo' s mind the bright morning - treacherously bright, he thought 
- had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. 
The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and 
singing. 




'No! I could not!' he said to himself. 'It is one thing to take my 
young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, 
and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and 
weariness may have no cure, is quite another - even if they are willing to 
come. The inheritance is mine alone. I don't think I ought even to take 
Sam.' He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him. 

'Well, Sam!' he said. 'What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as 
ever I can - in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at 
Crickhollow, if it can be helped.' 

'Very good, sir!' 

'You still mean to come with me?' 

'I do.' 

'It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. 'It is already dangerous. Most 
likely neither of us will come back.' 

'If you don't come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,' said Sam. 

'Don't you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I 
am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon, and if any of those Black 
Rulers try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said. They 
laughed.' 

'Who are they, and what are you talking about?' 

'The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed to know 
you were going away, so I didn't see the use of denying it. Wonderful folk, 
Elves, sir! Wonderful!' 

'They are,' said Frodo. 'Do you like them still, now you have had a 
closer view?' 

'They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,' answered 
Sam slowly. 'It don't seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite 
different from what I expected - so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it 
were.' 

Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward 
sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound 
like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked 
like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually 
thoughtful. 

'Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now - now that your wish to 
see them has come true already?' he asked. 

'Yes, sir. I don't know how to say it, but after last night I feel 




different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to 
take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't 
to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want - 1 don't rightly 
know what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies 
ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.' 

'I don't altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good 
companion. I am content. We will go together.' 

Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked 
over the land ahead, and called to Pippin. 

'All ready to start?' he said as Pippin ran up. 'We must be getting off 
at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.' 

'You slept late, you mean,' said Pippin. 'I was up long before; and we 
are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.' 

'I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry 
as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we 
left last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here.' 

'Then you are going to fly,' said Pippin. 'You won't cut straight on 
foot anywhere in this country.' 

'We can cut straighter than the road anyway,' answered Frodo. 'The 
Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left -you 
can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round the north end of 
the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But 
that is miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we 
made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.' 

'Short cuts make long delays, ' argued Pippin. 'The country is rough 
round here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the 
Marish -I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black 
Riders, I can't see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a 
wood or a field.' 

'It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,' answered 
Frodo. 'And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that 
you will be looked for on the road and not off it.' 

'All right!' said Pippin. 'I will follow you into every bog and ditch. 

But it is hard! I had counted on passing the Golden Perch at Stock before 
sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time 
since I tasted it.' 

'That settles it!' said Frodo. 'Short cuts make delays, but inns make 




longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from the Golden Perch. We 
want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?' 

'I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of private 
misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). 

Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let's go now!' 
said Pippin. 

It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds 
were beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain. 

The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick 
trees below. Their course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left, 
and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side 
of the hills, until they reached the flats beyond. Then they could make 
straight for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches 
and fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line. 

He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had 
appeared. There were no paths in the undergrowth, and they did not get on 
very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a 
stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep 
slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the 
line they had chosen. They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it 
at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering 
what to do. 'First check!' said Pippin, smiling grimly. 

Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he caught a 
glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down. 

'Look!' he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, and on 
the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing. Beside 
it stooped a black figure. 

They at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way, and 
plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream. 'Whew!' he said to 
Pippin. 'We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but we 
got under cover only just in time. You've got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear 
anything coming?' 

They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but 
there was no sound of pursuit. 'I don't fancy he would try bringing his 
horse down that bank,' said Sam. 'But I guess he knows we came down it. We 
had better be going on.' 

Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the 




bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. They were cut off 
from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. When 
they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired 
and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in 
which they were going. The banks of the stream sank, as it reached the 
levels and became broader and shallower, wandering off towards the Marish 
and the River. 

’Why, this is the Stock-brook!' said Pippin. 'If we are going to try 
and get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear right.' 

They waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown 
and treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of 
trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an 
ash. The ground was fairly level, and there was little undergrowth; but the 
trees were loo close for them to see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in 
sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. 
Then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged 
along 

as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of 
old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They did not 
talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side. 

After half an hour Pippin said: 'I hope we have not turned too much 
towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not 
a very broad belt —I should have said no more than a mile at the widest - 
and we ought to have been through it by now.' 

'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said Frodo. 'That won't 
mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am not sure that I want to 
come out into the open yet.' 

They went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed 
out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It was now past mid-day, 
and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its 
leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at its 
feel was fairly dry and sheltered. When they came to make their meal, they 
found that the Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale 
golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers, and was 
wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their 
fingers at rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would 
soon be behind them. 




Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam 
and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly: 

Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go 

To heal my heart and drown my woe. 

Rain may fall and wind may blow, 

And many miles be still to go, 

But under a tall tree I will lie, 

And let the clouds go sailing by. 

Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo 
sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind, like the cry of 
some evil and lonely creature. It rose and fell, and ended on a high 
piercing note. Even as they sat and stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was 
answered by another cry, fainter and further off, but no less chilling to 
the blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in 
the leaves. 

'And what do you think that was?' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak 
lightly, but quavering a little. 'If it was a bird, it was one that I never 
heard in the Shire before.' 

'It was not bird or beast,' said Frodo. 'It was a call, or a signal — 
there were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But no hobbit 
has such a voice.' 

No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no 
one spoke of them. They were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but 
sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the Ferry, 
and it was best to go sooner and in daylight. In a few moments they had 
shouldered their packs again and were off. 

Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched 
before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the 
south. Away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury 
across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from 
the edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they 
could. 

At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far back 
behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted. Frodo half 
expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark 
against the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sun escaping from the 
breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining 




brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the 
land became steadily more tame and well-ordered. Soon they came into 
well-tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for 
drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of 
the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew 
nearer; and the Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now 
left far behind. 

They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout 
gate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a 
distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped. 

'I know these fields and this gate!' he said. 'This is Bamfurlong, old 
Farmer Maggot's land. That's his farm away there in the trees.' 

'One trouble after another!' said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed 
as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon's den. 

The others looked at him in surprise. 

'What's wrong with old Maggot?' asked Pippin. 'He's a good friend to 
all the Brandy bucks. Of course he's a terror to trespassers, and keeps 
ferocious dogs - but after all, folk down here are near the border and have 
to be more on their guard.' 

'I know,' said Frodo. 'But all the same,' he added with a shamefaced 
laugh, 'I am terrified of him and his dogs. I have avoided his farm for 
years and years. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, 
when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat me, and 
then took me and showed me to his dogs. "See, lads," he said, "next time 
this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!" 
They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the fright - 
though I daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have 
touched me.' 

Pippin laughed. 'Well, it's time you made it up. Especially if you are 
coming back to live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stout fellow - if 
you leave his mushrooms alone. Fet's get into the lane and then we shan't be 
trespassing. If we meet him, I'll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry's, 
and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.' 

They went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large 
house and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead. The Maggots, 
and 

the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabitants of the Marish, were 




house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall 
all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the 
lane. 

Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out, 
and a loud voice was heard shouting: ’Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!' 

Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate 
opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed 
towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but 
Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him 
suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the 
three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling. 

Through the gate there now appeared a broad thick -set hobbit with a 
round red face. 'Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, and what may you be 
wanting?' he asked. 

'Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!' said Pippin. 

The farmer looked at him closely. 'Well, if it isn't Master Pippin - 
Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin. 
'It's a long time since I saw you round here. It's lucky for you that I know 
you. I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers. There are some 
funny things going on today. Of course, we do get queer folk wandering in 
these parts at times. Too near the River,' he said, shaking his head. 'But 
this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes on. He won't cross 
my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.' 

'What fellow do you mean?' asked Pippin. 

'Then you haven't seen him?' said the farmer. 'He went up the lane 
towards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny customer and 
asking funny questions. But perhaps you'll come along inside, and we'll pass 
the news more comfortable. I've a drop of good ale on tap, if you and your 
friends are willing, Mr. Took.' 

It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do 
it in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation. 'What 
about the dogs?' asked Frodo anxiously. 

The farmer laughed. 'They won't harm you - not unless I tell 'em to. 

Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!' he cried. 'Heel, Wolf!' To the relief of Frodo and 
Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free. 

Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. 'Mr. Frodo Baggins,' he 
said. 'You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.' At the 




name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment 
Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and 
that 

the dogs would be told to see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by the 
arm. 

'Well, if that isn't queerer than ever?' he exclaimed. 'Mr. Baggins is 
it? Come inside! We must have a talk.' 

They went into the farmer's kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. 

Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It 
was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than compensated for 
missing 

the Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural 
mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not 
disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however 
long ago. 

After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects 
(which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug and 
looked 

at them all in turn. 

'Now, Mr. Peregrin,' he said, 'where might you be coming from, and 
where might you be going to? Were you coming to visit' me? For, if so, you 
had gone past my gate without my seeing you.' 

'Well, no,' answered Pippin. 'To tell you the truth, since you have 
guessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your 
fields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way in the woods, back 
near Woodhall, trying to take a short cut to the Ferry.' 

'If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,' said 
the farmer. 'But I wasn't worrying about that. You have leave to walk over 
my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins - though I 
daresay you still like mushrooms.' He laughed. 'Ah yes, I recognized the 
name. I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst 
young rascals of Buckland. But it wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of. I had 
just heard the name Baggins before you turned up. What do you think that 
funny customer asked me?' 

They waited anxiously for him to go on. 'Well,' the farmer continued, 
approaching his point with slow relish, 'he came riding on a big black horse 
in at the gate, which happened to be open, and right up to my door. All 




black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want 
to be known. "Now what in the Shire can he want?" I thought to myself. We 
don't see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anyway I had never heard 
of any like this black fellow. 

' "Good-day to you!" I says, going out to him. "This lane don’t lead 
anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back to 
the road." I didn't like the looks of him; and when Grip came out, he took 
one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail 
and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still. 

' "I come from yonder," he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back 
west, over my fields, if you please. "Have you seen Baggins? " he asked in a 
queer voice, and bent down towards me. I could not see any face, for his 
hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down my back. But I did 
not see why he should come riding over my land so bold. 

' "Be off!" I said. "There are no Bagginses here. You're in the wrong 
part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton - but you can go 
by road this time." 

' "Baggins has left," he answered in a whisper. "He is coming. He is 
not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come 
back with gold." 

' "No you won't," I said. "You'll go back where you belong, double 
quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs." 

'He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. 

Then he spurred his great horse right at me, and I jumped out of the way 
only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the 
gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder. What do 
you think of that?' 

Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was 
how on earth would they reach the Ferry. 'I don't know what to think,' he 
said at last. 

'Then I'll tell you what to think,' said Maggot. 'You should never have 
gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up 
there.' Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer with an 
unfriendly eye. 'But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had 
left the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you 
were going to find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes of those strange 
doings of Mr. Bilbo's. His money was got in some strange fashion in foreign 




parts, they say. Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of 
the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?' 

Frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather 
disconcerting. 

'Well, Mr. Frodo,' Maggot went on, 'I'm glad that you've had the sense 
to come back to Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don't get mixed up 
with these outlandish folk. You'll have friends in these parts. If any of 
these black fellows come after you again, I'll deal with them. I'll say 
you're dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be 
true enough; for as like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.' 

'Maybe you're right,' said Frodo, avoiding the farmer's eye and staring 
at the fire. 

Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. 'Well, I see you have ideas of your 
own,' he said. 'It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and 
that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my news was no great news 
to you, after all. I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind 
to keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you 
are thinking it won't be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?' 

'I was thinking so,' said Frodo. But we have got to try and get there; 
and it won't be done by sitting and thinking. Sol am afraid we must be 
going. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I've been in terror of 
you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh 
to hear it. It's a pity: for I've missed a good friend. And now I'm sorry to 
leave so soon. But I'll come back, perhaps, one day - if I get a chance.' 

'You'll be welcome when you come,' said Maggot. 'But now I've a notion. 
It's near sundown already, and we are going to have our supper; for we 
mostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you and Mr. Peregrin and all could 
stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!' 

'And so should we!' said Frodo. 'But we must be going at once, I'm 
afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.' 

'Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I'll 
gel out a small waggon, and I'll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save 
you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.' 

Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin 
and Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was 
failing. Two of Maggot's sons and his three daughters came in, and a 
generous supper was laid on the large table. The kitchen was lit with 




candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot hustled in and out. One or two 
other hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. In a short while 
fourteen sat down to eat. There was beer in plenty, and a mighty dish of 
mushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay 
by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones. 

When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern 
and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. 
They threw their packs on board and climbed in. The farmer sat in the 
driving-seat, and whipped up his two stout ponies. His wife stood in the 
light of the open door. 

'You be careful of yourself. Maggot!' she called. 'Don't go arguing 
with any foreigners, and come straight back!' 

'I will!' said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no breath 
of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. 

They went without lights and took it slowly. After a mile or two the lane 
came to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to 
the high-banked causeway. 

Maggot got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but 
nothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was not a sound in the 
still air. Thin strands of river -mist were hanging above the dikes, and 
crawling over the fields. 

'It's going to be thick,' said Maggot; 'but I'll not light my lantern 
till I turn for home. We'll hear anything on the road long before we meet it 
tonight.' 

It was five miles or more from Maggot's lane to the Ferry. The hobbits 
wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the 
creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies' hoofs. The waggon 
seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards 
sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. 

They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by 
two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right. Farmer Maggot 
drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. They were just 
beginning lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what they had all been 
dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them. 

Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies' heads, and peering 
forward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. The 
fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air. 




'You'd better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam anxiously. 'You get down 
in the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we'll send this rider to the 
rightabouts!' He climbed out and went to the farmer's side. Black Riders 
would have to ride over him to get near the waggon. 

Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly on them. 

'Hallo there!' called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. 
They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard 
or two ahead. 'Now then!' said the farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and 
striding forward. 'Don't you come a step nearer! What do you want, and where 
are you going?' 

'I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?' said a muffled voice - but the 
voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern was uncovered, and 
its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer. 

'Mr. Merry!' he cried. 

'Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?' said Merry coming forward. 

As he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly to 
diminish to ordinary hobbit-size. He was riding a pony, and a scarf was 
swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog. 

Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. 'So there you are at 
last!' said Merry. 'I was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all 
today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across 
and rode up towards Stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches. But I'm 
blest if I know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. 
Maggot? In your duck-pond?' 

'No, I caught 'em trespassing,' said the farmer, 'and nearly set my 
dogs on 'em; but they'll tell you all the story, I've no doubt. Now, if 
you'll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I'd best be turning for 
home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.' 

He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. 'Well, good night to 
you all,' he said. 'It's been a queer day, and no mistake. But all's well as 
ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own 
doors. I'll not deny that I'll be glad now when I do.' He lit his lanterns, 
and got up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. 'I was 
nearly forgetting,' he said. 'Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with 
her compliments.' He handed it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of 
thanks and good-nights. 

They watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they 




dwindled into the foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from the covered 
basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising. 




Chapter 5 . A Conspiracy Unmasked 



'Now we had better get home ourselves,' said Merry. There's something 
funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.' 

They turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and 
edged with large white- washed stones. In a hundred yards or so it brought 
them to the river -bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A 
large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. The white bollards near the 
water's edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind them 
the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before 
them was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by 
the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side. 

Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others 
followed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine 
flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and 
up it a winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were twinkling 
there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds 
of mist, shone many round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows 
of 

Brandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandy bucks. 

Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one of the 
oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed the river, which 
was the original boundary of the land eastwards. He built (and excavated) 
Brandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck, and settled down to become 
master of what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew 
and grew, and after his days continued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied 
the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, 
and about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous 
dependants 

then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That was the 
origin of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old 
Forest, a sort of colony from the Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury, 
clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall. 

The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and the 
authority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck family 




was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey. 
But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, 
half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of fact, they were not very 
different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: 
they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim. 

Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side 
they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted many generations 
ago, and was now thick and tail, for it was constantly tended. It ran all 
the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the river, 
to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the 
Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to end. But, of course, it was 
not a complete protection. The Forest drew close to the hedge in many 
places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also 
was not usual in the Shire. 

The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shore drew 
nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river 
before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his 
old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched 
his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone 
on living quietly at Bag End. 

The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, and 
Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been 
looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper: 

'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?' 

On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a 
figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as they looked 
it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It 
then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps. 

'What in the Shire is that?' exclaimed Merry. 

'Something that is following us,' said Frodo. 'But don't ask any more 
now! Let's get away at once!' They hurried up the path to the top of the 
bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and 
nothing could be seen. 

'Thank goodness you don't keep any boats on the west -bank!' said Frodo. 
'Can horses cross the river?' 

'They can go twenty miles north to Brandywine Bridge - or they might 
swim,' answered Merry. 'Though I never heard of any horse swimming the 




Brandywine. But what have horses to do with it?' I'll tell you later. Let's 
get indoors and then we can talk.' 

'All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I'll just ride on and tell 
Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We'll see about supper and things.' 

'We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,' said Frodo; 'but we could 
do with another.' 

'You shall have it! Give me that basket!' said Merry, and rode ahead 
into the darkness. 

It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo's new house at 
Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the 
outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from 
the Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on 
their right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and 
down into the country. 

At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be 
seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of 
a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer 
hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of 
the country, and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in 
and out without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the 
Brandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to 
escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an 
old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it 
was long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round 
windows, and a large round door. 

As they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible; 
the windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty 
Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and 
shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on 
either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the 
house. 

'Well, what do you think of it?' asked Merry coming up the passage. 'We 
have done our best in a short time to make it look like home. After all 
Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.' 

Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favourite 
things - or Bilbo's things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new 
selling) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End. 




It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself 
wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement. 

It seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he 
wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave 
them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be done that very 
night, before they all went to bed. 

'It's delightful!' he said with an effort. 'I hardly feel that I have 
moved at all.' 

The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the 
floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end. 
Firelight came out, and a puff of steam. 

'A bath!' cried Pippin. 'O blessed Meriadoc!' 

'Which order shall we go in?' said Frodo. 'Eldest first, or quickest 
first? You'll be last either way, Master Peregrin.' 

'Trust me to arrange things better than that!' said Merry. 'We can't 
begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are 
three tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats 
and soap. Get inside, and be quick!' 

Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, 
and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper. 
Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound 
of 

splashing and wallowing. The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above 
the others in one of Bilbo's favourite bath-songs. 

Sing hey! for the bath at close of day 
that washes the weary mud away! 

A loon is he that will not sing: 

O! Water Hot is a noble thing! 

O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain, 
and the brook that leaps from hill to plain; 
but better than rain or rippling streams 
is Water Hot that smokes and steams. 

O! Water cold we may pour at need 
down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed; 
but better is Beer, if drink we lack, 




and Water Hot poured down the back. 



O! Water is fair that leaps on high 

in a fountain white beneath the sky; 

but never did fountain sound so sweet 

as splashing Hot Water with my feet! 

There was a terrific splash, and a shout of Whoa! from Frodo. It 
appeared that a lot of Pippin's bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on 
high. 

Merry went to the door: 'What about supper and beer in the throat?' he 
called. Frodo came out drying his hair. 

'There's so much water in the air that I'm coming into the kitchen to 
finish,' he said. 

'Lawks!' said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming. 'You 
ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. Peregrin,' he said. 
'Hurry up, or we shan't wait for you.' 

They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. 'I suppose you 
three won't want mushrooms again?' said Fredegar without much hope. 

'Yes we shall!' cried Pippin. 

'They're mine!' said Frodo. 'Given to me by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among 
farmers' wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I'll serve them.' 

Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest 
likings of Big People. A fact which partly explains young Frodo's long 
expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and the wrath of the 
injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to 
hobbit standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they 
had finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content. They pushed back 
the table, and drew chairs round the fire. 

'We'll clear up later,' said Merry. 'Now tell me all about it! I guess 
that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I 
want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with 
old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was 
scared, if that is possible.' 

'We have all been scared,' said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo 
stared at the fire and did not speak. 'You would have been, too, if you had 
been chased for two days by Black Riders.' 

'And what are they?' 




'Black figures riding on black horses,' answered Pippin. 'If Frodo 
won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave 
a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam 
gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent. 

'I should think you were making it all up,' said Merry, 'if I had not 
seen that black shape on the landing-stage - and heard the queer sound in 
Maggot's voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?' 

'Cousin Frodo has been very close,' said Pippin. 'But the time has come 
for him to open out. So far we have been given nothing more to go on than 
Farmer Maggot's guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo's 
treasure.' 

'That was only a guess,' said Frodo hastily. 'Maggot does not know 
anything.' 

'Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,' said Merry. 'A lot goes on behind his 
round face that does not come out in his talk. I've heard that he used to go 
into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good 
many strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think 
his guess good or bad.' 

'I think, ' answered Frodo slowly, 'that it was a good guess, as far as 
it goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo's old adventures, and the Riders 
are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or for me. I 
also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not 
safe here or anywhere else.' He looked round at the windows and walls, as if 
he was afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him in 
silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves. 

'It's coming out in a minute,' whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded. 

'Well!' said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as 
if he had made a decision. 'I can't keep it dark any longer. I have got 
something to tell you all. But I don't know quite how to begin.' 

'I think I could help you,' said Merry quietly, 'by telling you some of 
it myself.' 

'What do you mean?' said Frodo, looking at him anxiously. 'Just this, 
my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don't know how to say 
good-bye. You meant to leave the Shire, of course. But danger has come on 
you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at 
once. And you don't want to. We are very sorry for you.' 

Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprise was so 




comical that they laughed. 'Dear old Frodo!' said Pippin. 'Did you really 
think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful 
or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying 
farewell to all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly 
heard you muttering: "Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I 
wonder", and things like that. And pretending that you had come to the end 
of your money, and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those 
Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.' 

'Good heavens!' said Frodo. 'I thought I had been both careful and 
clever. I don't know what Gandalf would say. Is all the Shire discussing my 
departure then?' 

'Oh no!' said Merry. 'Don't worry about that! The secret won't keep for 
long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known to us 
conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are 
often with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo, 
too. To tell you the truth, I had been watching you rather closely ever 
since he left. I thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed I 
expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious. We have 
been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on 
your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and 
done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape 
so easily!' 

'But I must go,' said Frodo. 'It cannot be helped, dear friends. It is 
wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Since you have 
guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!' 

'You do not understand!' said Pippin. 'You must go - and therefore we 
must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow, and 
would jump down a dragon's throat to save you, if he did not trip over his 
own feet; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous 
adventure.' 

'My dear and most beloved hobbits!' said Frodo deeply moved. 'But I 
could not allow it. I decided that long ago, too. You speak of danger, but 
you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and -back journey. 

I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.' 

'Of course we understand,' said Merry firmly. 'That is why we have 
decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing -matter; but we are going to 
do our best to help you against the Enemy.' 




The Ring!' said Frodo, now completely amazed. 

'Yes, the Ring,' said Merry. 'My dear old hobbit, you don't allow for 
the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring 
for years - before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded 
it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our 
conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was 
too young, and he was also more careful - but he was not careful enough. If 
you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.' 

'Go on!' said Frodo faintly. 

'It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might 
expect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking along the 
road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared, 
coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he vanished. I 
was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary 
fashion; but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. I 
was peeping through into the road, after the S.-B.s had passed, and was 
looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of 
gold as he put something back in his trouser -pocket. 

'After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But 
you must admit that it was very intriguing, and I was only in my teens. I 
must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the 
old fellow's secret book.' 

'You have read his book!' cried Frodo. 'Good heavens above! Is nothing 
safe?' 

'Not too safe, I should say,' said Merry. 'But I have only had one 
rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I 
wonder what became of it. I should like another look. Have you got it, 
Frodo?' 

'No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.' 

'Well, as I was saying,' Merry proceeded, 'I kept my knowledge to 
myself, till this Spring when things got serious. Then we formed our 
conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not 
been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is 
worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can 
produce him.' 

'Where is he?' said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked 
and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard. 




’Step forward, Sam!' said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet 
up to the ears. 'Here's our collector of information ! And he collected a 
lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After which, I may say, 
he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.' 

'Sam!' cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and 
quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely 
foolish. 

'Yes, sir!' said Sam. 'Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no wrong 
to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter. He has some sense, 
mind you; and when you said go alone, he said no! lake someone as you can 
trust. ' 

'But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,' said Frodo. Sam looked 
at him unhappily. 'It all depends on what you want,' put in Merry. 'You can 
trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you 
can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself. 

But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a 
word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what 
Gandalf has told you. We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly 
afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.' 

'And after all, sir,' added Sam, 'you did ought to take the Elves' 
advice. Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can't deny 
it.' 

'I don't deny it,' said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. 'I 
don't deny it, but I'll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you 
snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure. 

'You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!' he said, turning to the 
others. 'But bless you!' he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, 'I give 
in. I will take Gildor's advice. If the danger were not so dark, I should 
dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have 
felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.' 

'Good! That's settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!' 
they shouted; and they danced round him. Merry and Pippin began a song, 
which they had apparently got ready for the occasion. 

It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his 
adventure long ago, and went to the same tune: 

Farewell we call to hearth and hall! 

Though wind may blow and rain may fall, 




We must away ere break of day 
Far over wood and mountain tall. 



To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell 
In glades beneath the misty fell, 

Through moor and waste we ride in haste, 

And whither then we cannot tell. 

With foes ahead, behind us dread, 

Beneath the sky shall be our bed, 

Until at last our toil be passed, 

Our journey done, our errand sped. 

We must away! We must away! 

We ride before the break of day! 

'Very good!' said Frodo. 'But in that case there are a lot of things to 
do before we go to bed - under a roof, for tonight at any rate.' 

'Oh! That was poetry!' said Pippin. 'Do you really mean to start before 
the break of day?' 

'I don't know,' answered Frodo. 'I fear those Black Riders, and I am 
sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place to which 
it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not to wait. But I should 
very much like to see Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed 
when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends on two 
things. Flow soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could 
we 

get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.' 

'The answer to the second question,' said Merry, 'is that we could get 
off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies 
in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for 
a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.' 

'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But 
what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?' 

'That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found 
you here,' answered Merry. 'They could have reached here by now, of course, 
if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the 
river -bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them 




through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they 
would try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message 
through to the Master of the Hall - for they would not like the look of the 
Riders, and would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland 
cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the 
morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be 
let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live 
at Crickhollow.' 

Frodo sat for a while in thought. 'I have made up my mind,' he said 
finally. 'I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going 
by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the 
North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of 
being secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more, 
the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched, 
whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don't know how many there 
are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is 
to go off in a quite unexpected direction.' 

'But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!' said Fredegar 
horrified. 'You can't be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as 
Black Riders.' 

'Not quite,' said Merry. It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo 
is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once. 

With luck we might gel a considerable start.' 

'But you won't have any luck in the Old Forest,' objected Fredegar. 'No 
one ever has luck in there. You'll gel lost. People don't go in there.' 

'Oh yes they do!' said Merry. 'The Brandybucks go in - occasionally 
when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once, 
long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when 
the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.' 

'Well, do as you think best!' said Fredegar. 'I am more afraid of the 
Old Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about it are a 
nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. 

Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what 
you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.' 

Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, 
nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from 
Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine 




Bridge. His task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was 
to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as 
possible the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He 
had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo's to help him in playing 
the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove. 

'Excellent!' said Frodo, when he understood the plan. ’We could not 
have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don't know whether 
these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk 
a written message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if Fatty 
is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we 
have gone, that decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing 
tomorrow.’ 

'Well, that's that,' said Pippin. 'On the whole I would rather have our 
job than Fatty's - waiting here till Black Riders come.' 

'You wait till you are well inside the Forest,' said Fredegar. 'You'll 
wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.' 

'It's no good arguing about it any more,' said Merry. 'We have still 
got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before we get 
to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.' 

When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. 

His legs ached. He. was glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually 
he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high 
window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots there 
was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they would 
smell him out sooner or later. 

Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a 
great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was 
not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in 
waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he 
was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath, 
and there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him 
a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over 
him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge 
towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a 
noise of thunder. 




Chapter 6. The Old Forest 



Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. Merry was standing 
there with a candle in one hand, and banging on the door with the other. 

'All right! What is it?' said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered. 

'What is it!' cried Merry. 'It is time to get up. It is half past four 
and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin 
is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be 
the baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up and 
see us off.' 

Soon after six o'clock the five hobbits were ready to start. Fatty 
Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in 
front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that went through 
a spinney behind the house, and then cut across several fields. The leaves 
of trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey 
with cold dew. Everything was still, and far-away noises seemed near and 
clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door of a distant 
house. 

In their shed they found the ponies; sturdy little beasts of the kind 
loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day's work. They mounted, 
and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed to open 
reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for 
about an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Fledge looming 
suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs. 'How are 
you going to get through this?' asked Fredegar. 'Follow me!' said Merry, 

'and you will see.' He turned to the left along the Hedge, and soon they 
came to a point where it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A 
cutting had been made, at some distance from the Hedge, and went sloping 
gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at the sides, which rose 
steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived 
deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side. 

Here Fatty Bolger halted. 'Good-bye, Frodo!' he said. 'I wish you were 
not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the 
day is out. But good luck to you - today and every day!' 

'If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be 
lucky,' said Frodo. 'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall 




soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.’ ’Good-bye!' they cried, and 
rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar's sight into the tunnel. 

It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of 
thick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had 
all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock 
clicked. The sound was ominous. 

’There!’ said Merry. 'You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and 
on the edge of the Old Forest.' 

'Are the stories about it true?' asked Pippin. 

'I don't know what stories you mean,' Merry answered. 'If you mean the 
old bogey-stories Fatty's nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves 
and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I don't believe them. 

But the Forest is queer. Everything in it is very much more alive, more 
aware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the Shire. And 
the trees do not like strangers. They watch you. They are usually content 
merely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts, and don't do much. 
Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root 
out, or grasp at you with a long trailer. But at night things can be most 
alarming, or so I am told. I have only once or twice been in here after 
dark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the trees were whispering 
to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; 
and the branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees 
do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In fact long 
ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it, 
and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and 
made a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long 
strip east of the Hedge. After that the trees gave up the attack, but they 
became very unfriendly. There is still a wide bare space not far inside 
where the bonfire was made.' 

'Is it only the trees that are dangerous?' asked Pippin. 

'There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the 
far side,' said Merry, 'or at least I have heard so; but I have never seen 
any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one 
finds 

open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer 
fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the 
beginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on 




more or less in our direction, east and a little north. That is the path I 
am going to try and find.’ 

The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. 

On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a 
hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it 
brought them under the trees. Looking back they could see the dark line of 
the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them. 
Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and 
shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or 
gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and 
slimy, shaggy growths. 

Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. 'You had better lead on and find 
that path,' Frodo said to him. 'Don't let us lose one another, or forget 
which way the Hedge lies!' 

They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, 
carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots. There was no 
undergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, and as they went forward it 
seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no 
sound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still 
leaves. For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the 
branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being 
watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. The feeling 
steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing 
back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow. 

There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed 
constantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it 
any longer, and without warning let out a shout. 'Oi! Oi !' he cried. 'I am 
not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!' 

The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy 
curtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become 
more 

crowded and more watchful than before. 

'I should not shout, if I were you,' said Merry. It does more harm than 
good.' 

Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if 
he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood. Merry 
was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. 




Pippin noticed it. 'It has not taken you long to lose us,' he said. But at 
that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead. 

'Well, well!' he said. 'These trees do shift. There is the Bonfire 
Glade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved 
away!' 

The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out of 
the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above 
them, blue and clear to their surprise, for down under the Forest -roof they 
had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist. The 
sun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into the clearing, 
though its light was on the tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker and 
greener about the edges of the glade, enclosing it with an almost solid 
wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky and 
faded hemlocks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and 
rampant nettles and thistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and 
cheerful garden after the close Forest. 

The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening 
daylight in the sky. At the far side of the glade there was a break in the 
wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into 
the wood, wide in places and open above, though every now and again the 
trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path they 
rode. They were still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and 
with better heart; for it seemed to them that the Forest had relented, and 
was going to let them pass unhindered after all. 

But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees drew 
close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now 
stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on 
them. So silent was it that the fall of their ponies' hoofs, rustling on 
dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in 
their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank 
to a murmur. 

O! Wanderers in the shadowed land 
despair not! For though dark they stand, 
all woods there be must end at last, 
and see the open sun go past: 
the setting sun, the rising sun, 
the day's end, or the day begun. 




For east or west all woods must fail... 

Fail - even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. The air 
seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome. Just behind them a large 
branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path. The 
trees seemed to close in before them. 

They do not like all that about ending and failing,' said Merry. 'I 
should not sing any more at present. Wait till we do get to the edge, and 
then we'll turn and give them a rousing chorus!' 

He spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show 
it. The others did not answer. They were depressed. A heavy weight was 
settling steadily on Frodo's heart, and he regretted now with every step 
forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees. He 
was, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still 
possible), when things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, and 
became for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, and ahead they 
could see the path going almost straight forward. Before them, but some 
distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald 
head out of the encircling wood. The path seemed to be making directly for 
it. 

They now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing 
out for a while above the roof of the Forest. The path dipped, and then 
again began to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep 
hillside. There it left the trees and faded into the turf. The wood stood 
all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a 
shaven crown. 

The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they 
reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming 
and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near at 
hand the mist was now almost gone; though here and there it lay in hollows 
of the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right 
across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke. 

'That,' said Merry, pointing with his hand, 'that is the line of the 
Withywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west through 
the 

midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below Haysend. We don't want to 
go that way! The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the 
whole wood - the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.' 




The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, but they 
could see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley; and beyond it 
the southern half of the Forest faded from view. 

The sun on the hill-lop was now getting hot. It must have been about 
eleven o'clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in 
other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the 
Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond it. Northward, where they 
looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the 
great East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea 
of trees, and the horizon was veiled. 

On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the 
slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like 
island-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep 
waters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, 
while they ate their mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passed noon they 
glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of the Downs that lay 
beyond the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for it was 
good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood's borders, though they did 
not mean to go that way, if they could help it: the Barrow-downs had as 
sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the Forest itself. 

At length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that had 
brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; but they had not 
followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the 
right. Soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must 
actually be heading towards the Withy windle valley: not at all the direction 
they wished lo take. After some discussion they decided to leave this 
misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to 
see it from the hill-top, the Road must lie that way, and it could not be 
many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed 
lo be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were 
thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange 
and nameless trees of the denser wood. 

At first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair 
speed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they 
seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But after a time the trees 
began to close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance to be 
thinner and less tangled. Then deep folds in the ground were discovered 




unexpectedly, like the ruts of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken 
roads long disused and choked with brambles. These lay usually right across 
their line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out 
again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they 
climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted 
undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way 
when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along the 
bottom before they could find a way up the further bank. Each time they 
clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left 
and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the 
right and downwards. 

After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though 
they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They 
were being headed off, and were simply following a course chosen for them - 
eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it. 

The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a 
fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met. It was so sleep 
and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again, either 
forwards or backwards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage 
behind. All they could do was to follow the fold - downwards. The ground 
grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they 
found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy 
bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and 
noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully 
over-arched by trees high above them. 

After stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite 
suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before 
them. Coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down 
through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide 
space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank 
almost as steep. A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy 
upon the hidden land between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark 
river of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with 
willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded 
willow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the 
branches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the 
valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking. 




'Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!' said Merry. 

'We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended. This is 
the River Withy windle! I will go on and explore.' 

He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses. 
After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground 
between the cliff-foot and the river; in some places firm turf went down to 
the water's edge. 'What's more,' he said, 'there seems to be something like 
a footpath winding along on this side of the river. If we turn left and 
follow it, we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest 
eventually.' 

'I dare say!' said Pippin. 'That is, if the track goes on so far, and 
does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. Who made the track, 
do you suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting 
very suspicious of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe 
all the stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we should 
have to go?' 

'No,' said Merry, 'I haven't. I don't know in the least how far down 
the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to 
make 

a path along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.' 

There being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to 
the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush 
and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy 
to follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among 
the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed over other rills, running down 
gullies into the Withywindle out of the higher forest-lands, and at these 
points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across. 

The hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies of all 
kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun was burning on their 
backs. At last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branches 
reached across the path. Each step forward became more reluctant than the 
last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs, 
and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes. 

Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. Just in front of him 
Pippin fell forward on to his knees. Frodo halted. 'It's no good,' he heard 
Merry saying. 'Can't go another step without rest. Must have nap. It's cool 
under the willows. Less flies!' 




Frodo did not like the sound of this. 'Come on!' he cried. 'We can't 
have a nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.' But the others were 
too far gone to care. Beside them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly. 

Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam. 
There now seemed hardly a sound in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. 
Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing, a soft fluttering as of a song 
half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes 
and saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it 
looked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many 
long-fingered hands, its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures 
that creaked faintly as the boughs moved. The leaves fluttering against the 
bright sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the 
grass. 

Merry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their 
backs to the willow-trunk. Behind them the great cracks gaped wide to 
receive them as the tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and 
yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. They shut their 
eyes, and then it seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, 
saying something about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell 
and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow. 

Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering 
him; then with an effort he struggled to his feel again. He felt a 
compelling desire for cool water. 'Wait for me, Sam,' he stammered. 'Must 
bathe feet a minute.' 

Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree, 
where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled dragonets 
straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel 
in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back 
against the tree. 

Sam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern. He was 
worried. The afternoon was getting late, and he thought this sudden 
sleepiness uncanny. 'There's more behind this than sun and warm air,' he 
muttered to himself. 'I don't like this great big tree. I don't trust it. 

Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won't do at all!' 

He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become 
of the ponies. He found that two had wandered on a good way along the path; 
and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others, when 




he heard two noises; one loud, and the other soft but very clear. One was 
the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise 
like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast. 

He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close to the edge, 
and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was 
not struggling. Sam gripped him by the jacket, and dragged him from under 
the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once 
he woke, and coughed and spluttered. 

'Do you know, Sam,' he said at length, 'the beastly tree threw me in! I 
felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!' 

'You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'You shouldn't sit 
in such a place, if you feel sleepy.' 

'What about the others?' Frodo asked. 'I wonder what sort of dreams 
they are having.' 

They went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam understood 
the click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. The crack by which he had 
laid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. Merry 
was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, 
but the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped 
like a pair of pincers. 

Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had lain. 

They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held 
poor Merry. It was quite useless. 

'What a foul thing to happen!' cried Frodo wildly. 'Why did we ever 
come into this dreadful Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow!' He 
kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his own feet. A hardly 
perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves 
rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter. 

'I suppose we haven't got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?' asked 
Sam. 

'I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,' said Frodo. 'That 
wouldn't be much use.' 

'Wait a minute!' cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. 

'We might do something with fire!' 

'We might,' said Frodo doubtfully. 'We might succeed in roasting Pippin 
alive inside.' 




'We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,' said Sam 
fiercely. 'If it don't let them go, I'll have it down, if I have to gnaw 
it.' He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-boxes 
and a hatchet. 

Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made 
a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These they heaped against the 
trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners. As soon as Sam had 
struck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of 
flame and smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers of fire licked 
against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it. A tremor 
ran through the whole willow. The leaves seemed to hiss above their heads 
with a sound of pain and anger. A loud scream came from Merry, and from far 
inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell. 

'Put it out! Put it out!' cried Merry. 'He'll squeeze me in two, if you 
don't. He says so!' 

'Who? What?' shouted Frodo, rushing round to the other side of the 
tree. 

'Put it out! Put it out!' begged Merry. The branches of the willow 
began to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading 
outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they 
had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river -valley and set up 
ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest. Sam kicked at the 
little fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of 
why he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the path crying help! help! 
help! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill 
voice: it was blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a 
clamour of leaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate: 
lost and witless. 

Suddenly he slopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it 
seemed to come from behind him, away down the path further back in the 
Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon there could be no doubt: 
someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and 
happily, but it was singing nonsense: 

Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! 

Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! 

Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! 




Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both 
stood still. Suddenly out of a long string of nonsense-words (or so they 
seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song: 

Hey! Come merry dot ! derry dol! My darling! 

Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling. 

Down along under Hill, shining in the sunlight, 

Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight, 

There my pretty lady is. River-woman's daughter, 

Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water. 

Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing 

Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing? 

Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o, 

Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o! 

Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away! 

Tom's in a hurry now. Evening will follow day. 

Tom's going home again water-lilies bringing. 

Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing? 

Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves 
hung silently again on stiff branches. There was another burst of song, and 
then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there appeared above the 
reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in 
the band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it 
seemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite 
tall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for one, 
slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging 
through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat 
and a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red 
as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter. In his 
hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white 
water-lilies. 

'Help!' cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands 
stretched out. 

'Whoa! Whoa! steady there!’ cried the old man, holding up one hand, and 
they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. 'Now, my little 
fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows? What's the matter 
here then? Do you know who I am? I'm Tom Bombadil. Tell me what's 
your 




trouble! Tom's in a hurry now. Don't you crush my lilies!' 

'My friends are caught in the willow-tree,' cried Frodo breathlessly. 

'Master Merry's being squeezed in a crack!' cried Sam. 

'What?' shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air. 'Old Man Willow? 
Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for 
him. Old grey Willow-man! I'll freeze his marrow cold, if he don't behave 
himself. I'll sing his roots off. I'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and 
branch away. Old Man Willow!' Setting down his lilies carefully on the 
grass, he ran to the tree. There he saw Merry's feet still sticking out - 
the rest had already been drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth to the 
crack and began singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch the 
words, but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tom sprang 
away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with 
it. 'You let them out again, Old Man Willow!' he said. 'What be you 
a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! 
Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!' He then seized Merry's feet and drew him 
out of the suddenly widening crack. 

There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it 
Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks 
closed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip, and 
complete silence fell. 

'Thank you!' said the hobbits, one after the other. 

Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. 'Well, my little fellows!' said he, 
stooping so that he peered into their faces. 'You shall come home with me! 
The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and 
butter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for questions around the supper 
table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!' With that he picked up 
his lilies, and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and 
dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and nonsensically. 

Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him 
as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in 
front of them, and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away. 
Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo! 

Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle! 

Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle. 

Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping. 

When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open, 




Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow. 

Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow! 

Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you. 

Hey now! merry dot! We'll be waiting for you! 

After that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to 
sink into the trees behind them. They thought of the slanting light of 
evening glittering on the Brandywine River, and the windows of Bucklebury 
beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them; 
trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path. White 
mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the 
roots of the trees upon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a 
shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk. 

It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their 
legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on 
either side of them; and if they looked up to the pale sky, they caught 
sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the 
twilight, and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the 
wood. They began to feel that all this country was unreal, and that they 
were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening. 

Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed 
that the ground was gently rising. The water began to murmur. In the 
darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the river flowed over 
a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left 
behind. They stepped out from the Forest, and found a wide sweep of grass 
welling up before them. The river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily 
down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars, which 
were already shining in the sky. 

The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown 
or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge. 
The path was now plain before them, well -tended and bordered with stone. It 
wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry 
night; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the 
twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up again, up 
a long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow 
beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom 
Bombadil’s house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep 
shoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of 




the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night. 

They all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half their 
weariness and all their fears had fallen from them. Hey! Come merry dol! 
rolled out the song to greet them. 

Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties! 

Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties. 

Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together! 

Then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like the 
song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in 
the hills, came falling like silver to meet them: 

Now let the song begin! Let us sing together 

Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather, 

Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather, 

Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather, 

Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water: 

Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter! 

And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden 
light was all about them. 




Chapter 7 . In the House of Tom Bombadil 



The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood 
still, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with the light of 
lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished 
wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly. 

In a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a 
woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was 
green, 

green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was 
of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of 
forget-me-nots. About her feel in wide vessels of green and brown 
earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be 
enthroned in the midst of a pool. 

’Enter, good guests!' she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was 
her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further 
into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surprised and 
awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of 
water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers. 
But before they could say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the 
lily -bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled 
softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river. 

’Come dear folk!' she said, taking Frodo by the hand. Faugh and be 
merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River.' Then lightly she passed them 
and closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread 
out across it. 'Let us shut out the night!' she said. 'For you are still 
afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. 
Fear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.' 

The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and 
smiled. 'Fair lady Goldberry!' said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved 
with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood 
enchanted by fair el ven- voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was 
different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to 
mortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange. 'Fair lady Goldberry!' he said 
again. 'Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to 




me. 

O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water ! 

O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter! 

O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after! 

O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!' 

Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear 
himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed. 

'Welcome!' she said. 'I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so 
sweet -tongued. But I see you are an elf-friend; the light in your eyes and 
the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait 
for the Master of the house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired 
beasts.' 

The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry 
busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender 
grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind 
the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught, among 
many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words: 

Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow; 

Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow. 

'Fair lady!' said Frodo again after a while. 'Tell me, if my asking 
does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?' 

'He is,' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling. 

Frodo looked at her questioningly. 'He is, as you have seen him,' she 
said in answer to his look. 'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.' 

'Then all this strange land belongs to him?' 

'No indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a 
burden,' she added in a low voice, as if to herself. 'The trees and the 
grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to 
themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one has ever caught old Tom 
walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under 
light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.' 

A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his 
thick 

brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed, and going to 
Goldberry, took her hand. 

'Here's my pretty lady!' he said, bowing to the hobbits. 'Here's my 
Goldberry clothed all in silver -green with flowers in her girdle! Is the 




table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter; 
milk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for 
us? Is the supper ready?' 

'It is,' said Goldberry; 'but the guests perhaps are not?' 

Tom clapped his hands and cried: 'Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and 
you had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, and Tom will refresh 
you! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your 
muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!' 

He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and 
round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping roof (a 
penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house). Its walls 
were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats 
and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green 
rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, 
laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench 
laden with wide earthenware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled 
with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set 
ready beside each bed. 

Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the 
table, two on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry and the Master. 

It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, as only famished 
hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking -bowls seemed 
to be clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free 
their voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing 
merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking. 

At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The 
guests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, each with a 
footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearth before 
them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built of 
apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights in the room 
were put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the 
chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood before them, holding a candle; 
and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep. 

'Have peace now,' she said, 'until the morning! Heed no nightly noises! 

For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the 
wind off the hill-top. Good night!' She passed out of the room with a 
glimmer and a rustle. The sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling 




gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night. 

Tom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them tried to 
muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at 
supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke: 

'Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought 
you at that moment?' 

Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. 'Eh, what?' said 
he. 'Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just 
chance brought me then, if chance you call it. It was no plan of mine, 
though I was waiting for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you 
were wandering. We guessed you'd come ere long down to the water: all paths 
lead that way, down to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he's a mighty 
singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes. But Tom 
had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.' Tom nodded as if sleep was 
taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice: 

I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies, 
green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady, 
the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter, 
to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted. 

Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her, 
in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle; 
there they open first in spring and there they linger latest. 

By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter, 
fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes. 

Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating! 

He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue: 

And that proved well for you — for now I shall no longer 
go down deep again along the forest-water, 
not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing 
Old Man Willow's house this side of spring-time, 
not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter 
dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water. 

He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more 
question: the one he most desired to have answered. 'Tell us, Master,' he 
said, 'about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.' 

'No, don't!' said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. 

'Not now! Not until the morning!' 




That is right!' said the old man. 'Now is the time for resting. Some 
things are ill to hear when the world's in shadow. Sleep till the 
morning -light, rest on the pillow ! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no grey 
willow!' And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a 
candle in either hand he led them out of the room. 

Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were 
of white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn 
the light covers over them before they were asleep. 

In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the 
young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall 
of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that 
he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of 
hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a 
pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood 
the figure of a man. The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above 
his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the 
dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many 
wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the 
moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he 
wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed 
and 

the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it 
was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East. 
'Black Riders!' thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs 
still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the 
courage to leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still 
listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep 
again or wandered into some other unremembered dream. 

At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his 
dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had 
waked, 

and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: 
tip-tap, squeak : the noise was like branches fretting in the wind, 
twig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered if 
there were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a 
dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the 
willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him 




again. He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay 
down again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: ’Fear 
nothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!' Then he went 
to sleep again. 

It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet 
sleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading 
irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled 
under the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. 'I shall be drowned!' he 
thought. It will find its way in, and then I shall drown.' He felt that he 
was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his fool on the 
corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was and lay 
down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: 'Nothing passes doors or 
windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top.' A 
little breath of sweet air moved the curtain. He breathed deep and fell 
asleep again. 

As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep 
content, if logs are contented. 

They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was moving 
about the room whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped 
his hands, and cried: 'Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!' He drew 
back the yellow curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had covered the 
windows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking 
west. 

They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found 
himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected to 
see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually 
his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far 
beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a 
pale morning: in the East, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool 
stained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of 
rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on 
the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves. 

Pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. The 
Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking down on to a sloping 
cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken 
into many plumes and billows; the valley of the Withywindle. The stream ran 
down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. Near at hand 




was a flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver -netted, and beyond that grey 
shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be seen. 

'Good morning, merry friends!' cried Tom, opening the eastern window 
wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. 'Sun won't show her face 
much today. I'm thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping on the hilltops, 
since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet 
sky above me. I wakened Goldberry singing under window; but nought 
wakes 

hobbit-folk in the early morning. In the night little folk wake up in the 
darkness, and sleep after light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my 
merry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, 
my hearties! If you come soon you'll find breakfast on the table. If you 
come late you'll get grass and rain-water!' 

Needless to say - not that Tom's threat sounded very serious - the 
hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo 
look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard 
about the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and 
singing here and there outside. The room looked westward over the 
mist-clouded valley, and the window was open. Water dripped down from the 
thatched eaves above. Before they had finished breakfast the clouds had 
joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and 
steadily down. Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled. 

As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was 
flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of Goldberry singing 
up above them. They could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that 
the song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the 
tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The 
hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed 
the kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing. The thought of 
going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed 
now 

that they would not go further that day. 

The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled 
up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs. Nothing could 
be seen all round the house but falling water. Frodo stood near the open 
door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and 




go bubbling away down into the valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round 
the 

corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain - and 
indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his 
boots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he sat in the 
largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him. 

This is Goldberry's washing day,' he said, ’and her autumn-cleaning. 

Too wet for hobbit-folk - let them rest while they are able! It’s a good day 
for long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tom will start the 
talking.’ 

He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if 
speaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue 
eye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn to song, and he would 
get out of his chair and dance about. He told them tales of bees and 
flowers, the ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the Forest, about 
the evil things and good things, things friendly and things unfriendly, 
cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles. 

As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest, 
apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all 
other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old 
Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more 
than 

enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare the hearts of 
trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with 
a hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, 
hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest 
without reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten 
woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the 
fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The 
countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with 
malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was 
rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of 
winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the 
river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like 
fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till 
it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge 
to the Downs. 




Suddenly Tom’s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young 
stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among 
small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at last up on to 
the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and the 
stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. Sheep were 
bleating in flocks. Green walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses 
on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young Sun 
shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords. There was 
victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went 
up into the sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and 
mounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over 
all. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were 
empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were 
stirred in the mounds. Barrow- wights walked in the hollow places with a 
clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind.' Stone rings 
grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight. 

The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of the 
Barrow- wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had been heard. But it 
was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a comfortable 
fireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this 
house had driven from their minds: the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under 
the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. They lost the thread of his tale 
and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another. 

When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered 
into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought, 
into limes when the world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the 
western Shore; and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient 
starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and 
they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep. The hobbits sat still 
before him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the spell of his words, 
the wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been 
withdrawn, and darkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was 
filled with the light of white stars. 

Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed 
Frodo could not tell. Ele did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled 
with wonder. The stars shone through the window and the silence of the 
heavens seemed to be round him. He spoke at last out of his wonder and a 




sudden fear of that silence: 

’Who are you, Master?' he asked. 

’Eh, what?' said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom. 

'Don't you know my name yet? That's the only answer. Tell me, who are you, 
alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that's 
what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the 
trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths 
before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here 
before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow- wights. When the Elves passed 
westward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark 
under the stars when it was fearless - before the Dark Lord came from 
Outside.' 

A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily 
through the panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stood in the door 
behind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding its flame from the 
draught with her hand; and the light flowed through it, like sunlight 
through a white shell. 

'The rain has ended,' she said; 'and new waters are running downhill, 
under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!' 

'And let us have food and drink!' cried Tom. 'Long tales are thirsty. 

And long listening's hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!' With that he 
jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the 
chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then he danced 
about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared. 

Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom and 
Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in 
laughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the 
caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance, 
neither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the 
table; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order. 

The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. Tom bowed to his guests. 
'Supper is ready,' said Goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was 
clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes' 
mail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and 
he had green stockings. 

It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of 




Tom's words may have missed one meal or many, but when the food was 
before 

them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten. They did not sing or 
even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. But after 
a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in 
mirth and laughter. 

After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that 
began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the 
silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had 
known, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like 
jewels in the depths. Then once more she wished them each good night and 
left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them 
with 

questions. 

He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and 
indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from 
days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves. It no longer surprised 
them; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to 
Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance 
than 

they had imagined. 'There's earth under his old feet, and clay on his 
fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,' said Tom. It was 
also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some 
fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo. 

Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that 
Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears 
than he had told before even to Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up and down, 
and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders. 

'Show me the precious Ring!' he said suddenly in the midst of the 
story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his 
pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom. 

It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big 
brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a 
second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright 
blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the 
end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the 
hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no 




sign of Tom disappearing! 

Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air - and it 
vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry - and Tom leaned forward and handed 
it back to him with a smile. 

Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has 
lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked the same and 
weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh 
strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He 
was 

perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even 
Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when 
the talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers 
and their queer ways - then he slipped the Ring on. 

Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked 
an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all 
right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not 
see him. He got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the 
outer door. 

'Hey there!' cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in 
his shining eyes. 'Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom 
Bombadil's not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand's 
more fair without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down beside me! 
We 

must talk a while more, and think about the morning. Tom must teach the 
right road, and keep your feet from wandering.' 

Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came 
and sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine 
tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful. 
But they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a 
thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change 
sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. 'I am no weather-master,' 
he said; 'nor is aught that goes on two legs.' 

By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house, 
over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might hope in that way 
to strike the East Road in a day's journey, and avoid the Barrows. He told 
them not to be afraid - but to mind their own business. 

'Keep to the green grass. Don't you go a-meddling with old stone or 




cold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts 
that never falter!' He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass 
barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one. Then he 
taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger 
or difficulty the next day. 

Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! 

By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow, 

By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! 

Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us! 

When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on 
the shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them back to their 
bedroom. 




Chapter 8 . Fog on the Barrow-Downs 



That night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of 
them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his 
mind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey 
rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, 
until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him 
under a swift sunrise. 

The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a 
tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and 
through the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold. 

After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say 
farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool, 
bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh 
from the North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and 
moving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced 
upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good 
speed. 

They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and 
went slanting up towards the north end of the hill -brow under which it 
sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep 
slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped. 

'Goldberry!' he cried. 'My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have 
never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!' He was so 
distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came 
rippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair 
was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. A light 
like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she 
danced. 

They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They 
bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked 
out from the hill-top over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and 
far-seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in 
the Forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark 
trees in the West. In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green, 




yellow, russet under the sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the 
Brandywine. To the South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was a 
distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop 
in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits. 
Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and 
swellings of grey and green and pale earth -colours, until it faded into a 
featureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge 
behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it 
was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with 
the hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of 
the high and distant mountains. 

They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few 
stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted 
to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road, 
when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of 
the hills straight towards the Mountains. 

Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. ’Speed 
now, fair guests!’ she said. 'And hold to your purpose! North with the wind 
in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the Sun 
shines!' And to Frodo she said: 'Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry 
meeting!' 

But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, 
and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the 
hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view. 
The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and 
the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when 
they reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small 
and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still 
watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked 
she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished 
behind the hill . 

Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet 
of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the 
shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth 
sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys. There was no 
tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy 
turf, silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land, 




and high lonely cries of strange birds. As they journeyed the sun mounted, 
and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown 
less. When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest 
seemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf 
and root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze 
above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy. 

About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, 
like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there was no air 
stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode across and looked 
northwards. Then their hearts rose, for it seemed plain that they had come 
further already than they had expected. Certainly the distances had now all 
become hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were 
coming to an end. A long valley lay below them winding away northwards, 
until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there 
seemed to be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark 
line. That is a line of trees,' said Merry, 'and that must mark the Road. 

All along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing. 

Some say they were planted in the old days.' 

'Splendid!' said Frodo. 'If we make as good going this afternoon as we 
have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and 
be jogging on in search of a camping place.' But even as he spoke he turned 
his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and 
looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds, 
and on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of 
green gums. 

That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and 
went down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood a single 
stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no 
shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding 
finger, or more like a warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun was 
still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of 
the stone. It was cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at 
that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as 
good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came 
from 'down under Hill'. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of 
the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass. 

Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the 




scent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and 
looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to 
explain what happened. However, that may be: they woke suddenly and 
uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. The standing stone 
was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them. 
The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist just above 
the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east, 
beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy 
and chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads 
down. 

The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim. 

They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out 
in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white 
sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog rolled up 
to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads 
until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central 
pillar was the standing stone. 

They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite 
lose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line 
of the Road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay. In any 
case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone 
that no thought of remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as 
quickly as their chilled fingers would work. 

Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and 
down the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As they 
went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and 
dripping on their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it was so cold 
that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed 
with grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again, 
feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. They were steering, as 
well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end 
of the long valley which they had seen in the morning. Once they were 
through the gap, they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line 
and they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go 
beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs 
there might be no fog. 

Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and 




wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam 
was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley 
seemed 

to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side 
ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they 
were at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the 
Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free. 

'Come on! Follow me!' he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried 
forward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm. The dark 
patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous 
before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a 
headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen 
any sign of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the 
morning. He had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even 
as 

he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared and snorted, 
and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others 
had not followed him. 'Sam!' he called. 'Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why 
don't you keep up?' 

There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones 
shouting wildly: 'Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!' The pony bolted into the mist 
and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: 
'Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!' It was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the 
great stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the 
direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill. 

As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more 
frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint 
and far ahead and high above him. 'Frodo! Hoy!' came the thin voices out of 
the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated, 
ending with a last help! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut 
short. He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries; 
but the light was now gone, and clinging night had closed about him, so that 
it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time to be 
climbing up and up. 

Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he 
at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was weary, sweating and yet 
chilled. It was wholly dark. 




'Where are you?' he cried out miserably. 

There was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware that it 
was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy 
wind. A change was coming in the weather. The mist was flowing past him 
now 

in shreds and tatters. His breath was smoking, and the darkness was less 
near and thick. He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were 
appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind 
began to hiss over the grass. 

He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards 
it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and 
the starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing 
southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from the 
north. Out of the east the biting wind was blowing. To his right there 
loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood 
there. 

’Where are you?' he cried again, both angry and afraid. 

'Here!' said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the 
ground. 'I am waiting for you!' 

'No!' said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell 
on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he 
looked 

up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars. It 
leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a 
pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance. Then a grip 
stronger and colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and 
he remembered no more. 

When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing 
except a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned, 
caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wight had taken him, and he 
was probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrow- wights about 
which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself: 
flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast. 

But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very 
darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo 
Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the 
Shire and talking about roads and adventures. There is a seed of courage 




hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid 
hobbit, wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow. Frodo 
was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, 

Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought 
he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought 
hardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he no 
longer felt limp like a helpless prey. 

As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all 
at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was 
growing round him. It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was 
in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor 
beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there 
in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were 
on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in 
white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light 
they looked cold and unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains 
were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by 
their sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three necks 
lay one long naked sword. 

Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The voice 
seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, 
sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad 
but horrible sounds, strings of words would now and again shape themselves: 
grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. The night was railing 
against the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the 
warmth for which it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while 
the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it 
had changed into an incantation: 

Cold be hand and heart and bone, 

and cold be sleep under stone: 

never mare to wake on stony bed, 

never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead. 

In the black wind the stars shall die, 
and still on gold here let them lie, 
till the dark lord lifts his hand 
over dead sea and withered land. 

He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself 




on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind 
of passage which behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long arm 
was groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest, and 
towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him. 

At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the 
incantation. Then a wild thought of escape came to him. He wondered if he 
put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find 
some way out. He thought of himself running free over the grass, grieving 
for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself. Gandalf would 
admit that there had been nothing else he could do. 

But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he 
could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket, 
and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer. 
Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay 
beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions. 
With what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and 
the hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the 
hilt. There was a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a 
snarling noise. 

Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry's face felt cold. All at once 
back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of 
the fog, came the memory of the house down under the Hill, and of Tom 
singing. He remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them. In a small 
desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! and with that name his voice 
seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber 
echoed as if to drum and trumpet. 

Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! 

By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow, 

By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! 

Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us! 

There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart 
beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was 
coming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice 
singing: 

Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow, 

Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow. 

None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master: 




His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster. 

There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and 
suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. A low 
door -like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond Frodo's feet; 
and there was Tom's head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of 
the sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the 
faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, but the 
sickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they were only very deeply 
asleep. 

Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing: 

Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight! 

Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing, 

Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains! 

Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty! 

Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness, 

Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended. 

At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber 
fell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away 
into an unguessable distance; and after that silence. 

’Come, friend Frodo!' said Tom. 'Let us get out on to clean grass! You 
must help me bear them.' 

Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo left the 
barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, 
like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom went back in again, 
and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he 
was 

bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver, 
copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He 
climbed 

the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine. 

There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and 
looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon 
the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a 
clear and commanding voice: 

Wake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling! 

Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen; 

Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken. 




Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open! 

To Frodo’s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed 
their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement, 
first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow-top 
above them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and 
belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets. 

'What in the name of wonder?' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet 
that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his 
face, and he closed his eyes. 'Of course, I remember!' he said. 'The men of 
Carn Dym came on us at night, and we were worsted. Ah! the spear in my 
heart!' He clutched at his breast. 'No! No!' he said, opening his eyes. 

'What am I saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?' 

'I thought that I was lost,' said Frodo; 'but I don't want to speak of 
it. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!' 

'Dressed up like this, sir?' said Sam. 'Where are my clothes?' He flung 
his circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as 
if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other 
hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand. 

'You won't find your clothes again,' said Tom, bounding down from the 
mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight. One would have 
thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the 
horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him, and saw the merry 
glint in his eyes. 

'What do you mean?' asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half 
amused. 'Why not?' 

But Tom shook his head, saying: 'You've found yourselves again, out of 
the deep water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be 
glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb! 
Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!' 

He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him 
Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between 
their 

hill and the next, still whistling and crying: 

Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander? 

Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder? 

Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin, 

White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin! 




So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he 
was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now! 
came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south. 

The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while 
on the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in the sun with the 
delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a 
friendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake 
one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of 
promise. 

By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He 
reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an 
obedient line six ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly 
old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their 
own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them 
any such names, but they answered to the new names that Tom had given 
them 

for the rest of their lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed 
over the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits. 

'Here are your ponies, now!' he said. 'They've more sense (in some 
ways) than you wandering hobbits have - more sense in their noses. For they 
sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save 
themselves, then they run the right way. You must forgive them all; for 
though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow- wights is not what 
they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!' 

Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from 
their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on 
some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the 
oncoming of winter. 

'Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?' 
asked Frodo. 

'He's mine,' said Tom. 'My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride 
him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies 
stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the 
night, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he'd look for them and with 
his words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old 
Tom's going to ride. Hey! he's coming with you, just to set you on the road; 
so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, 




when you're on your own legs trying to trot beside them.' 

The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times; 
but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he 
would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his 
land. Tve got things to do,' he said: 'my making and my singing, my 
talking and my walking, and my watching of the country. Tom can't be always 
near to open doors and willow-cracks. Tom has his house to mind, and 
Goldberry is waiting.' 

It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten, 
and the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last meal had been lunch 
beside the standing stone the day before. They breakfasted now off the 
remainder of Tom's provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that 
Tom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits and 
the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating 
Tom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures. Most of these he 
made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie 
there 'free to all finders, birds, beasts. Elves or Men, and all kindly 
creatures'; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and 
no Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch 
set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue 
butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his 
head, and saying at last: 

'Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who long 
ago wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not 
forget her!' 

For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, 
of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. 
They 

gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange 
metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some 
virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the 
blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun. 

'Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,' he said. 

'Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, or 
far away into dark and danger.' Then he told them that these blades were 
forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the 
Dark 




Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dym in the Land of 
Angmar. 

'Few now remember them,' Tom murmured, 'yet still some go wandering, 
sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things 
folk that are heedless.' 

The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a 
vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast 
shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall and grim with 
bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision 
faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. 

They made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. Their new 
weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them 
very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. Fighting had not 
before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their 
flight would land them. 

At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then 
mounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back and saw the 
top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went 
up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was 
hidden from view. 

Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great 
stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap 
and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry 
journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on 
Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom 
sang 

most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange 
language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were 
mainly 

those of wonder and delight. 

They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further 
away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day 
would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day 
before. The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of 
bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further 
side. Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very 
long lime ago. He seemed to remember something sad about it, and would not 




say much. 

They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, 
and then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearing somewhat to the 
west. The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, 
but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall 
trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many 
unexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs, 
and halted under the long shadows of the trees. They were on the top of a 
sloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away 
below 

them. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on 
their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore 
many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of 
water. They rode down the bank and looked up and down. There was nothing 
to 

be seen. 'Well, here we are again at last!' said Frodo. 'I suppose we 
haven’t lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest! But 
perhaps the delay will prove useful - it may have put them off our trail.' 

The others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders 
came suddenly over them again. Ever since they had entered the Forest they 
had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; only now when it lay 
beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was 
more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself. They 
looked anxiously back towards the setting sun, but the Road was brown and 
empty. 

'Do you think,' asked Pippin hesitatingly, 'do you think we may be 
pursued, tonight?' 

'No, I hope not tonight,' answered Tom Bombadil; 'nor perhaps the next 
day. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain. Out east my 
knowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond 
his country.' 

All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that 
he would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyone did. They would 
soon 

now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but 
the most vague and distant legends of the Shire, and in the gathering 
twilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on 




them. They stood silent, reluctant to make the final parting, and only 
slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to 
have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting. 

’Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your 
own luck must go with you and guide you): four miles along the Road you'll 
come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward. 
There you'll find an old inn that is called The Prancing Pony. Barliman 
Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There you can stay the night, and afterwards 
the morning will speed you upon your way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your 
merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!' 

They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more 
with them; but he laughed and refused, saying: 

Tom's country ends here: he will not pass the borders. 

Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting! 

Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin's back, and rode 
up over the bank and away singing into the dusk. 

The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight. 

'I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,' said Sam. 'He's a 
caution and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further and see 
naught better, nor queerer. But I won't deny I'll be glad to see this 
Prancing Pony he spoke of. I hope it'll be like The Green Dragon away back 
home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?' 

'There are hobbits in Bree,' said Merry, 'as well as Big Folk. I 
daresay it will be homelike enough. The Pony is a good inn by all accounts. 

My people ride out there now and again.' 

'It may be all we could wish,' said Frodo; 'but it is outside the Shire 
all the same. Don't make yourselves too much at home ! Please remember -all 
of you - that the name of Baggins must NOT be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, 
if any name must be given.' 

They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening. 
Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again, 
until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead. 

Before them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against misty 
stars; and under its western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they 
now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a door between them and the 
night. 




Chapter 9 . At the Sign of 



The Prancing Pony 

Bree was the chief village of the Bree-land, a small inhabited region, 
like an island in the empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, there 
was Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a deep valley a little 
further eastward, and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood. Lying round 
Bree-hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland 
only a few miles broad. 

The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short, cheerful 
and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves; but they were more 
friendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and other inhabitants of 
the world about them than was (or is) usual with Big People. According to 
their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants 
of the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few 
had survived the turmoils of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned 
again over the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and they 
were still there now, when the memory of the old Kings had faded into the 
grass. 

In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within 
a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were 
mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing 
of 

their origin. They were taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were 
believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the 
languages of beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards 
even as far as the Misty Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen. 
When they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten 
tales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends 
of them. 

There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land and they 
claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that was 
founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized. 
They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself, 
especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the Men. 




The Big Folk and the Little Folk (as they called one another) were on 
friendly terms, minding their own affairs in their own ways, but both 
rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Bree-folk. Nowhere 
else in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found. 

The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much; and the 
affairs of the four villages were their chief concern. Occasionally the 
Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the Eastfarthing; but though 
their link land was not much further than a day's riding east of the 
Brandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited it. An 
occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a 
night or two, but even that was becoming less and less usual. The 
Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond 
the borders, as Outsiders, and took very little interest in them, 
considering them dull and uncouth. There were probably many more 
Outsiders 

scattered about in the West of the World in those days than the people of 
the Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to 
dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them. But in the 
Bree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no more 
rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten 
that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between 
the 

Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts. 

The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk, 
mostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with windows looking west. 
On that side, running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to 
it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side. Over this 
the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred 
by a great gate. There was another gate in the southern comer where the Road 
ran out of the village. The gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside 
them were small lodges for the gatekeepers. 

Down on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of 
the hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago when the traffic 
on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways; 
another ancient road crossed the East Road just outside (he dike at the 
western end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various 
sorts had travelled much on it. Strange as News from Bree was still a saying 




in the Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North, 
South, and East could be heard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used 
to go more often to hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate, 
and the North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the 
Bree-folk called it the Greenway. 

The Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an 
important person. His house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and 
inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of the four villages; 
and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly 
dwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains. 

It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his 
companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the village. 
They came to the West-gate and found it shut, but at the door of the lodge 
beyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped up and fetched a lantern and 
looked over the gate at them in surprise. 

’What do you want, and where do you come from?' he asked gruffly. 

'We are making for the inn here,' answered Frodo. 'We are journeying 
east and cannot go further tonight.' 

'Hobbits ! Four hobbits ! And what's more, out of the Shire by their 
talk,' said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. He stared at 
them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride 
through. 

'We don't often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,' he went 
on, as they halted a moment by his door. 'You'll pardon my wondering what 
business takes you away east of Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?' 

'Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good 
place to discuss them,' said Frodo, not liking the look of the man or the 
tone of his voice. 

'Your business is your own, no doubt,' said the man; 'but it's my 
business to ask questions after nightfall.' 

'We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to 
stay at the inn here,' put in Merry. 'I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough 
for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so I had 
heard.' 

'All right, all right!' said the man. 'I meant no offence. But you'll 
find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you 
questions. There's queer folk about. If you go on to The Pony, you'll find 




you're oat the only guests.' 

He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see 
in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them curiously. He was 
glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward. He 
wondered why the man was so suspicious, and whether any one had been 
asking 

for news of a party of hobbits. Could it have been Gandalf? He might have 
arrived, while they were delayed in the Forest and the Downs. But there was 
something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy. 

The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to 
his house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in 
over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street. 

The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, 
and drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large and strange to them. 
Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt 
his heart sink. He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees, 
and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course 
of his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and 
their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring 
day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the 
inn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows. 

'We surely aren't going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?' he 
exclaimed. 'If there are hobbit-folk in these pans, why don't we look for 
some that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.' 

'What's wrong with the inn?' said Frodo. 'Tom Bombadil recommended it. 
I expect it's homelike enough inside.' 

Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. 

It had a front on the Road, and two wings running back on land partly cut 
out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor 
windows were level with the ground. There was a wide arch leading to a 
courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a 
large doorway reached by a few broad steps. The door was open and light 
streamed out of it. Above the arch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a 
large signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the door 
was painted in white letters: THE PRANCING PONY by BARLIMAN 
BUTTERBUR. Many 

of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains. 




As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry 
song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. They 
listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their 
ponies. The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping. 

They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the 
yard they climbed up the steps. Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a 
short fat man with a bald head and a red face. He had a white apron on, and 
was bustling out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden 
with full mugs. 

’Can we—' began Frodo. 

'Half a minute, if you please!' shouted the man over his shoulder, and 
vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In a moment he was out 
again, wiping his hands on his apron. 

'Good evening, little master!' he said, bending down. 'What may you be 
wanting?' 

'Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed. 

Are you Mr. Butterbur?' 

'That's right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service! 
You're from the Shire, eh?' he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand 
to his forehead, as if trying to remember something. 'Hobbits!' he cried. 

'Now what does that remind me of? Might I ask your names, sir?' 

'Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,' said Frodo; 'and this is Sam Gamgee. My 
name is Underhill.' 

'There now!' said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. 'It's gone 
again! But it'll come back, when I have time to think. I'm run off my feet; 
but I'll see what I can do for you. We don't often get a party out of the 
Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you welcome. But there is 
such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn't been for long 
enough. It never rains but it pours, we say in Bree. 

'Hi! Nob!' he shouted. 'Where are you, you woolly -footed slow-coach? 
Nob!' 

'Coming, sir! Coming!' A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, 
and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great 
interest. 

'Where's Bob?' asked the landlord. 'You don't know? Well find him! 
Double sharp! I haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there's 
five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room somehow.' Nob trotted 




off with a grin and a wink. 

'Well, now, what was I going to say?' said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his 
forehead. 'One thing drives out another, so to speak. I'm that busy tonight, 
my head is going round. There's a party that came up the Greenway from 
down 

South last night - and that was strange enough to begin with. Then there's a 
travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening. And now 
there's you. If you weren't hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But 
we've got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for 
hobbits, when this place was built. On the ground floor as they usually 
prefer; round windows and all as they like it. I hope you'll be comfortable. 
You'll be wanting supper, I don't doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!' 

He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. 'Here is a 
nice little parlour!' he said. 'I hope it will suit. Excuse me now. I'm that 
busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It's hard work for two legs, 
but I don't get thinner. I'll look in again later. If you want anything, 
ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he don't come, ring and shout!' 

Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed 
capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he might be. They found 
themselves in a small and cosy room. There was a bit of bright fire burning 
on the hearth, and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs. 
There was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a 
large hand-bell. But Nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before 
they thought of ringing. He brought candles and a tray full of plates. 

'Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?' he asked. 'And shall 
I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?' 

They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr. 
Butterbur and Nob came in again. In a twinkling the table was laid. There 
was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter, 
and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as the Shire could show, 
and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam's misgivings (already much 
relieved by the excellence of the beer). 

The landlord hovered round for a link, and then prepared to leave them. 

'I don't know whether you would care to join the company, when you have 
supped,' he said, standing at the door. 'Perhaps you would rather go to your 
beds. Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you, if you had a 
mind. We don't get Outsiders - travellers from the Shire, I should say, 




begging your pardon - often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story 
or song you may have in mind. But as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack 
anything!' 

So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper 
(about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary 
talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company. Merry said it 
would be too stuffy. 'I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and 
perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and don't 
forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still on the 
high-road and not very far from the Shire!' 

'All right!' said Pippin. 'Mind yourself! Don't get lost, and don't 
forget that it is safer indoors!' 

The company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathering was 
large and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used to the light. 

This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from 
the beams were dim, and half veiled in smoke. Barliman Butterbur was 
standing near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two 
strange-looking men. On the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a 
collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more 
dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows 
and comers. 

As soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome 
from the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that had come up the 
Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to 
the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were 
seldom sure who the names belonged to. The Men of Bree seemed all to have 
rather botanical (and to the Shire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, 
Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention 
Butterbur). Some of the hobbits had similar names. The Mug worts, for 
instance, seemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such as 
Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which 
were 

used in the Shire. There were several Underhills from Saddle, and as they 
could not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took Frodo to 
their hearts as a long-lost cousin. 

The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo 
soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be 




given. He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which 
there was much wagging of heads, although neither of these words were much 
used in the Bree-dialect). He said he was thinking of writing a book (at 
which there was silent astonishment), and that he and his friends wanted to 
collect information about hobbits living outside the Shire, especially in 
the eastern lands. 

At this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted to 
write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned enough for 
several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not enough, he was given 
a whole list of names, beginning with 'Old Barliman here', to whom he could 
go for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign 
of writing a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about 
doings in the Shire. Frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon 
found himself sitting alone in a comer, listening and looking around. 

The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling 
flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. There was trouble away 
in the South, and it seemed that the Men who had come up the Greenway 
were 

on the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. The 
Bree-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large 
number of strangers into their little land. One of the travellers, a 
squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more and more people 
would be coming north in the near future. 'If room isn't found for them, 
they'll find it for themselves. They've a right to live, same as other 
folk,' he said loudly. The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the 
prospect. 

The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, and it did not at 
the moment seem to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings 
in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam and Pippin, who were now 
feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire. 
Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the 
roof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the 
fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out 
like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made 
Frodo a little uneasy. One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been in 
the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who 
they were related to. 




Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, 
sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently to the 
hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a 
long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him, 
showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much 
wear and were now caked with mud. A travel -stained cloak of heavy dark- 
green 

cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he 
wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be 
seen as he watched the hobbits. 

’Who is that?' Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr. 
Butterbur. 'I don't think you introduced him?' 

'Him?' said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye 
without turning his head. 'I don't rightly know. He is one of the wandering 
folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare 
tale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he 
pops up again. He was in and out pretty often last spring; but I haven't 
seen him about lately. What his right name is I've never heard: but he's 
known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; 
though he don't tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there's no 
accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the 
Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.' But at 
that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his 
last remark remained unexplained. 

Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard or 
guessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave of his hand and a 
nod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him. As Frodo drew near be 
threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey, 
and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes. 

'I am called Strider,' he said in a low voice. 'I am very pleased to 
meet you. Master - Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.' 

'He did,' said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under the 
stare of those keen eyes. 

'Well, Master Underhill,' said Strider, 'if I were you, I should stop 
your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, and chance -meeting 
are pleasant enough, but, well - this isn't the Shire. There are queer folk 
about. Though I say it as shouldn't, you may think,' he added with a wry 




smile, seeing Frodo's glance. 'And there have been even stranger travellers 
through Bree lately,' he went on, watching Frodo's face. 

Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no further 
sign. His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin. To his alarm 
Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took, encouraged by his success 
with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic 
account of Bilbo's farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the 
Speech, and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance. 

Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local 
hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond 
the River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing or two, and 
had probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo's vanishing. It would bring 
the name of Baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries 
in Bree after that name. 

Frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evidently much 
enjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite forgetful of 
their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even 
mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous. 

'You had better do something quick!' whispered Strider in his ear. 

Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The attention 
of Pippin's audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and 
laughed and clapped, thinking that Mr. Underhill had taken as much ale as 
was good for him. 

Frodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit 
when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. He felt the Ring 
on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on 
and vanish out of the silly situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if me 
suggestion came to him from outside, from someone or something a the room. 
He resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if 
to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. At 
any rate it gave him no inspiration. He spoke 'a few suitable words', as 
they would have said in the Shire: We are all very much gratified by the 
kindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will 
help to renew the old ties of friendship between the Shire and Bree; and 
then he hesitated and coughed. 

Everyone in the room was now looking at him. 'A song!' shouted one of 
the hobbits. 'A song! A song!' shouted all the others. 'Come on now, master, 




sing us something that we haven’t heard before!' 

For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a 
ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud 
of, for he had made up the words himself). It was about an inn; and that is 
probably why it came into Frodo's mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a 
few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered. 

There is an inn, a merry old inn 
beneath an old grey hill, 

And there they brew a beer so brown 
That the Man in the Moon himself came down 
one night to drink his fill. 

The ostler has a tipsy cat 
that plays a five-stringed fiddle; 

And up and down he runs his bow, 

Now squeaking high, now purring low, 
now sawing in the middle. 

The landlord keeps a little dog 
that is mighty fond of jokes; 

When there's good cheer among the guests, 

He cocks an ear at all the jests 
and laughs until he chokes. 

They also keep a horned cow 
as proud as any queen; 

But music turns her head like ale, 

And makes her wave her tufted tail 
and dance upon the green. 

And O! the rows of silver dishes 
and the store of silver spoons! 

For Sunday* there's a special pair, 

And these they polish up with care 
on Saturday afternoons. 



The Man in the Moon was drinking deep, 




and the cat began to wail; 

A dish and a spoon on the table danced, 

The cow in the garden madly pranced, 
and the little dog chased his tail. 

The Man in the Moon took another mug, 
and then rolled beneath his chair; 

And there he dozed and dreamed of ale, 

Till in the sky the stars were pale, 
and dawn was in the air. 

Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat: 

'The white horses of the Moon, 

They neigh and champ their silver bits; 

But their master's been and drowned his wits, 
and the Sun'll be rising soon!' 

So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle, 
a jig that would wake the dead: 

He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune, 
While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon: 
'It's after three!' he said. 

They rolled the Man slowly up the hill 
and bundled him into the Moon, 

While his horses galloped up in rear, 

And the cow came capering like a deer, 
and a dish ran up with the spoon. 

Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle; 
the dog began to roar, 

The cow and the horses stood on their heads; 

The guests all bounded from their beds 
and danced upon the floor. 

With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke! 
the cow jumped over the Moon, 




And the little dog laughed to see such fun, 

And the Saturday dish went off at a run 
with the silver Sunday spoon. 

The round Moon rolled behind the hill 
as the Sun raised up her head. 

She * hardly believed her fiery eyes; 

For though it was day, to her surprise 
they all went back to bed! 

There was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, and the song 
tickled their fancy. 'Where's old Barley?' they cried. 'He ought to hear 
this. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and then we'd have a dance.' 

They called for more ale, and began to shout: 'Let's have it again, master! 
Come on now! Once more!' 

They made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his song again, 
while many of them joined in; for the tune was well known, and they were 
quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo's turn to feel pleased with 
himself. He capered about on the table; and when he came a second time to 
the cow jumped over the Moon, he leaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for 
he came down, bang, into a tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off 
the table with a crash, clatter, and bump! The audience all opened their 
mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short a gaping silence; for the singer 
disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor 
without leaving a hole ! 

The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet 
and shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam, 
who 

found themselves left alone in a comer, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from 
a distance. It was plain that many people regarded them now as the 
companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But 
there 

was one swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and 
half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he 
slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had 
been whispering together a good deal during the evening. Harry the 
gatekeeper also went out just behind them.. 

Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under 




the tables to the dark comer by Strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of 
his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the Ring. How 
it came to be on his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he 
had been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and that somehow it had 
slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a 
moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it 
had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt 
in the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out. 

'Well?' said Strider, when he reappeared. ’Why did you do that? Worse 
than anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or 
should I say your finger?' 

'I don't know what you mean,' said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed. 

'Oh yes, you do,' answered Strider; 'but we had better wait until the 
uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, I should like a 
quiet word with you.' 

'What about?' asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name. 

'A matter of some importance - to us both,' answered Strider, looking 
Frodo in the eye. 'You may hear something to your advantage.' 

'Very well,' said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. 'I'll talk to 
you later.' 

Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had 
come trotting in, and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting 
accounts of the event at the same time. 

'I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,' said a hobbit; 'or leastways I didn't see 
him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished into thin air, in a manner of 
speaking.' 

'You don't say, Mr. Mugwort!' said the landlord, looking puzzled. 

'Yes I do!' replied Mugwort. 'And I mean what I say, what's more.' 

'There's some mistake somewhere,' said Butterbur, shaking his head. 
There was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing into thin air; or 
into thick air, as is more likely in this room.' 

'Well, where is he now?' cried several voices. 

'How should I know? He's welcome to go where he will, so long as he 
pays in the morning. There's Mr. Took, now: he's not vanished.' 

'Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn't,' said Mugwort 
obstinately. 

'And I say there's some mistake,' repeated Butterbur, picking up the 




tray and gathering up the broken crockery. 

'Of course there's a mistake!' said Frodo. 'I haven't vanished. Here I 
am! I've just been having a few words with Strider in the comer.' 

He came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed 
away,, even more perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied 
by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after 
he had fallen. Most of the Hobbits and the Men of Bree went off then and 
there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that evening. One 
or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves. 

The 

Dwarves and the two or three strange Men that still remained got up and said 
good night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before long no 
one was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall. 

Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, very probably, 
that his house would be full again on many future nights, until the present 
mystery had been thoroughly discussed. 'Now what have you been doing, Mr. 
Underhill?' he asked. 'Frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks 
with your acrobatics!' 

'I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,' said Frodo. 'It was quite 
unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.' 

'All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you're going to do any more tumbling, 
or conjuring, or whatever it was, you'd best warn folk beforehand - and warn 
me. We're a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way -uncanny, 
if you understand me; and we don't take to it all of a sudden.' 

'I shan't be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise 
you. And now I think I'll be getting to bed. We shall be making an early 
start. Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight o'clock?' 

'Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in 
private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my mind that I ought 
to tell you. I hope that you'll not take it amiss. When I've seen to a thing 
or two, I'll come along to your room, if you're willing.' 

'Certainly!' said Frodo; but his heart sank. He wondered how many 
private talks he would have before he got to bed, and what they would 
reveal. Were these people all in league against him? He began to suspect 
even old Butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs. 




Chapter 10. Strider 



Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no 
light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until 
they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots 
that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting 
in a chair by the door! 

'Hallo!' said Pippin. 'Who are you, and what do you want?' 

'I am called Strider,' he answered: 'and though he may have forgotten 
it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.' 

'You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,' said 
Frodo. 'What have you to say?' 

'Several things,' answered Strider. 'But, of course, I have my price.' 

'What do you mean?' asked Frodo sharply. 

'Don't be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and 
give you some good advice - but I shall want a reward.' 

'And what will that be, pray?' said Frodo. He suspected now that he had 
fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought 
only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he 
could not spare any of it. 

'No more than you can afford,' answered Strider with a slow smile, as 
if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. 'Just this: you must take me along with you, 
until I wish to leave you.' 

'Oh, indeed!' replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. 'Even if 
I wanted another companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I 
knew a good deal more about you, and your business.' 

'Excellent!' exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back 
comfortably. 'You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to 
the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you 
what I know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when 
you have heard me.' 

'Go on then!' said Frodo. 'What do you know?' 

'Too much; too many dark things,' said Strider grimly. 'But as for your 
business — ' He got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked 
out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. 'I have quick ears,' he 
went on, lowering his voice, 'and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted 




many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. 
Now, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four 
hobbits came out of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to 
old Bombadil or to one another, but one thing interested me. Please 
remember, said one of them, that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I 
am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that 
I followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. 
Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, I 
should advise him and his friends to be more careful.' 

'I don't see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,' said Frodo 
angrily, 'and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr. Strider may 
have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should 
advise him to explain it.' 

'Well answered!' said Strider laughing. 'But the explanation is simple: 

I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted to find him 
quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret 
that concerned me and my friends. 

'Now, don't mistake me!' he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam 
jumped up with a scowl. 'I shall take more care of the secret than you do. 

And care is needed!' He leaned forward and looked at them. 'Watch every 
shadow!' he said in a low voice. 'Black horsemen have passed through Bree. 
On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared 
later, 

coming up the Greenway from the south.' 

There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: 'I ought to 
have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,' he said. 'And the 
landlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the 
company? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have 
stayed quiet in here.' 

'It would have been better,' said Strider. 'I would have stopped your 
going into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me 
in to see you, or take a message.' 

'Do you think he ' began Frodo. 

'No, I don't think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not 
altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.' Frodo gave him a puzzled 
look. 'Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?' said Strider with a 
curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. 'But I hope we shall get to 




know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened 
at the end of your song. For that little prank ' 

'It was sheer accident!' interrupted Frodo. 

'I wonder,' said Strider. 'Accident, then. That accident has made your 
position dangerous.' 

'Hardly more than it was already,' said Frodo. 'I knew these horsemen 
were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to 
have gone away.' 

'You must not count on that!' said Strider sharply. 'They will return. 

And more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these 
Riders.' He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. 'And there are some 
folk in Bree who are not to be trusted,' he went on. 'Bill Ferny, for 
instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his 
house. You must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering 
fellow. He was very close with one of the Southern strangers, and they 
slipped out together just after your "accident". Not all of those 
Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; 
or make mischief for amusement.' 

'What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?' 
said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider's hints. 

'News of you, of course,' answered Strider. 'An account of your 
performance would be very interesting to certain people. After that they 
would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely 
that they will hear of it before this night is over. Is that enough? You can 
do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say 
that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I 
have wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look. I might 
prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the 
horsemen will watch it night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be 
allowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won't go far. They will 
come on you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you 
wish them to find you? They are terrible!' 

The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was 
drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair. The 
room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a 
while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening 
to sounds in the Night far away. 




'There!' he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. 
'Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but 
you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape, if you 
can. Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have 
him?' 

There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was confused 
with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he 
broke out: 

'With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no! This Strider here, he warns 
and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let's begin with him. He 
comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows 
something, that's plain, and more than I like; but it's no reason why we 
should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he 
puts it.' 

Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, 
but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away. 
'No,' he said slowly. 'I don't agree. I think, I think you are not really as 
you choose to look. You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your 
voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don't see why you should 
warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? 
Who are you? What do you really know about - about my business; and how 
do 

you know it?' 

'The lesson in caution has been well learned,' said Strider with a grim 
smile. 'But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get 
to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must 
make up your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will help 
you to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me 
already? Still here it is ' 

At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur had 
arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider 
withdrew into a dark corner. 

'I've come to bid you good night,' said the landlord, putting the 
candles on the table. 'Nob! Take the water to the rooms!' He came in and 
shut the door. 

'It's like this,' he began, hesitating and looking troubled. 'If I've 
done any harm, I'm sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you'll 




admit; and I'm a busy man. But first one thing and then another this week 
have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, 
I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of 
Baggins in particular.' 

'And what has that got to do with me?' asked Frodo. 

'Ah! you know best,' said the landlord, knowingly. 'I won't give you 
away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of 
Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may 
say so.' 

'Indeed! Let's have it then!' said Frodo, unwisely interrupting. 

'A stout little fellow with red cheeks, ' said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. 

Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. 'That won't help you much; it 
goes for most hobbits. Barley, he says to me,' continued Mr. Butterbur with 
a glance at Pippin. 'But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, 
and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your 
pardon, but he said it, not me.' 

'He said it? And who was he?' asked Frodo eagerly. 

'Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, 
but he's a good friend of mine, whether or no. But now I don't know what 
he'll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into 
a block of wood, I shouldn't wonder. He's a bit hasty. Still what's done 
can't be undone. ' 

'Well, what have you done?' said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow 
unravelling of Butterbur's thoughts. 

'Where was I?' said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers. 

'Ah, yes ! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right into my room 
without a knock. Barley, he says, I'm off in the morning. Will you do 
something for me? You've only to name it, I said. I'm in a hurry, said he, 
and I've no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you 
anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I said, tomorrow, 
maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow, he says, and then he gave me a 
letter. 

'It's addressed plain enough,' said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter 
from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued 
his reputation as a lettered man): 

Mr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE. 

'A letter for me from Gandalf!' cried Frodo. 




'Ah!' said Mr. Butterbur. 'Then your right name is Baggins?' 

'It is,' said Frodo, 'and you had better give me that letter at once, 
and explain why you never sent it. That's what you came to tell me, I 
suppose, though you've taken a long time to come to the point.' 

Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. 'You're right, master,' he said, 

'and I beg your pardon. And I'm mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if 
harm comes of it. But I didn't keep it back a-purpose. I put it by safe. 

Then I couldn't find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day 
after, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after 
another drove it out of my mind. I'm a busy man. I'll do what I can to set 
matters right, and if there's any help I can give, you've only to name it. 

'Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he says 
to me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way 
before long, him and another. He'll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that! 
But you need ask no questions. And if I'm not with him, he may be in 
trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I'll be 
grateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.' 

'What do you mean?' asked Frodo. 

'These black men,' said the landlord lowering his voice. 'They're 
looking for Baggins, and if they mean well, then I'm a hobbit. It was on 
Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny, 

I 

called it. Nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the door 
asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob's hair was all stood on end. I bid 
the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they've been 
asking the same question all the way to Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, 
Strider, he's been asking questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you, 
before you'd had bite or sup, he did.' 

'Fie did!' said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. 'And 
much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.' 

The landlord jumped with surprise. 'You!' he cried. 'You're always 
popping up. What do you want now?' 

'He's here with my leave,' said Frodo. 'He came to offer me his help.' 

'Well, you know your own business, maybe,' said Mr. Butterbur, looking 
suspiciously at Strider. 'But if I was in your plight, I wouldn't take up 
with a Ranger.' 

'Then who would you take up with?' asked Strider. 'A fat innkeeper who 




only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day? They 
cannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long 
road before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?' 

'Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn't do that for any money,' said Mr. Butterbur, 
looking really scared. 'But why can't you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr. 
Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men 
after, and where do they come from, I'd like to know?' 

'I'm sorry I can't explain it all,' answered Frodo. 'I am tired and 
very worried, and it's a long tale. But if you mean to help me, I ought to 
warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These 
Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from ' 

'They come from Mordor,' said Strider in a low voice. 'From Mordor, 
Barliman, if that means anything to you.' 

'Save us!' cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was 
known to him. 'That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time.' 'It 
is,' said Frodo. 'Are you still willing to help me?' 'I am,' said Mr. 

Butterbur. 'More than ever. Though I don't know what the likes of me can do 
against, against ' he faltered. 

'Against the Shadow in the East,' said Strider quietly. 'Not much, 
Barliman, but every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here 
tonight, as Mr. Underhill, and you can forget the name of Baggins, till he 
is far away.' 

'I'll do that,' said Butterbur. 'But they'll find out he's here without 
help from me, I'm afraid. It's a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention to himself 
this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo's going off has 
been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing 
in his slow pate: and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he 
is.' 

'Well, we can only hope the Riders won't come back yet,' said Frodo. 

'I hope not, indeed,' said Butterbur. 'But spooks or no spooks, they 
won't get in The Pony so easy. Don't you worry till the morning. Nob'll say 
no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my legs. Me 
and my folk'll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you 
can.' 

'In any case we must be called at dawn,' said Frodo. 'We must get off 
as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.' 

'Right! I'll see to the orders,' said the landlord. 'Good night, Mr. 




Baggins - Underhill, I should say! Good night - now, bless me! Where's your 
Mr. Brandybuck?' 

'I don’t know,' said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all 
about Merry, and it was getting late. 'I am afraid he is out. He said 
something about going for a breath of air.' 

'Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on 
a holiday!' said Butterbur. 'I must go and bar the doors quick, but I'll see 
your friend is let in when he comes. I'd better send Nob to look for him. 
Good night to you all!' At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another 
doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head. His footsteps retreated 
down the passage. 

'Well?' said Strider. 'When are you going to open that letter?' Frodo 
looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be 
Gandalf s. Inside, written in the wizard's strong but graceful script, was 
the following message: 

THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear's Day, Shire Year, 1418. 

Dear Frodo, 

Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better 
leave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the end of July at 
latest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find 
that you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. 
You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the 
Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. He knows our business 
and will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope we may meet again. If I 
do not come, Elrond will advise you. 

Yours in haste 

GANDALF. 

PS. Do NOT use It again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel by 
night! 

PPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men 
on the roads. His true name is Aragorn. 

All that is gold does not glitter, 

Not all those who wander are lost; 

The old that is strong does not wither, 

Deep roots are not reached by the frost. 

From the ashes a fire shall be woken, 

A light from the shadows shall spring; 




Renewed shall be blade that was broken, 
The crownless again shall be king. 



PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his 
memory is like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, I 
shall roast him. 

Fare Well 7 

Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. 
'Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things!' he said. 'He deserves 
roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in 
Rivendell by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf? He writes as if he 
was going into great danger.' 

'He has been doing that for many years,' said Strider. 

Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf s 
second postscript. 'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf s friend at 
once?' he asked. 'It would have saved time.' 

'Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?' said Strider. 

'I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had to persuade you to 
trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend 
to tell you all about myself at once. I had to study you first, and make 
sure of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had 
made up my mind, I was ready to tell you whatever you asked. But I must 
admit,' he added with a queer laugh, 'that I hoped you would take to me for 
my own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for 
friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.' 

'They are - at first sight at any rate,' laughed Pippin with sudden 
relief after reading Gandalf's letter. 'But handsome is as handsome does, as 
we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after 
lying for days in hedges and ditches.' 

'It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering 
in the Wild to make you look like Strider,' he answered. 'And you would die 
first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.' 

Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyed Strider 
dubiously. 'How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?' 
he demanded. 'You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You 
might be a play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with 




you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have 
you to say to that?' 

'That you are a stout fellow,' answered Strider; 'but I am afraid my 
only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I 
could kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk. 

If I was after the Ring, I could have it - NOW!' 

He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a 
light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the 
hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side. They did not dare to 
move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly. 

'But I am the real Strider, fortunately,' he said, looking down at them 
with his face softened by a sudden smile. 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and 
if by life or death I can save you, I will.' 

There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. 'I 
believed that you were a friend before the letter came,' he said, 'or at 
least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never 
in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of 
his spies would - well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.' 

'I see,' laughed Strider. 'I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? All 
that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost ' 

'Did the verses apply to you then?' asked Frodo. 'I could not make out 
what they were about. But how did you know that they were in Gandalf s 
letter, if you have never seen it?' 

'I did not know,' he answered. 'But I am Aragorn, and those verses go 
with that name.' He drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was 
indeed broken a foot below the hilt. 'Not much use is it, Sam?' said 
Strider. 'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.' 

Sam said nothing. 

'Well,' said Strider, 'with Sam's permission we will call that settled. 

Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we 
are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it 
unnoticed. But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or 
two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the 
pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.' 

'Weathertop?' said Sam. 'What's that?' 

'It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here 
to Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a 




chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. 
After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have 
to choose between various dangers.' 

’When did you last see Gandalf?' asked Frodo. 'Do you know where he is, 
or what he is doing?' 

Strider looked grave. 'I do not know,' he said. 'I came west with him 
in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the 
last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We 
last met on the first of May: at Sam Ford down the Brandywine. He told me 
that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for 
Rivendell in the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I 
went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some 
news reached him, and I was not at hand to help. 

'I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should 
have had messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, many 
days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and wide that 
Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of 
Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your 
home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching 
the East Road anxiously.' 

'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it - with 
Gandalf's absence, I mean?' asked Frodo. 

'I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except 
the Enemy himself,' said Strider. 'But do not give up hope ! Gandalf is 
greater than you Shire-folk know - as a rule you can only see his jokes and 
toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.' 

Pippin yawned. 'I am sorry,' he said, 'but I am dead tired. In spite of 
all the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is 
that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in 
the dark to look for him.' 

At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the 
passage. Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob. He shut the door 
hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in 
alarm for a moment before he gasped: 'I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen 
them! Black Riders!' 

'Black Riders!' cried Frodo. 'Where?' 

'Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did 




not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again and was 
standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I 
shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son 
of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of 
the lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was 
no horse.' 

'Which way did it go?' asked Strider, suddenly and sharply. Merry 
started, noticing the stranger for the first time. 'Go on!' said Frodo. 

'This is a friend of Gandalf's. I will explain later.' 

'It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,' continued Merry. 'I 
tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the 
corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.' 

Strider looked at Merry with wonder. 'You have a stout heart,' he said; 

'but it was foolish.' 

'I don't know,' said Merry. 'Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could 
hardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and 
suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the other was 
whispering, or hissing. I couldn't hear a word that was said. I did not 
creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt 
terrified, and I turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when 
something came behind me and I... I fell over.' 

'I found him, sir,' put in Nob. 'Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a 
lantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just 
nigh Bill Ferny's house I thought I could see something in the Road. I 
couldn't swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over 
something, lilting it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there 
was no signs of them, and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He 
seemed to be asleep. "I thought I had fallen into deep water," he says to 
me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he 
got up and ran back here like a hare.' 

'I am afraid that's true,' said Merry, 'though I don't know what I 
said. I had an ugly dream, which I can't remember. I went to pieces. I don't 
know what came over me.' 

'I do,' said Strider. 'The Black Breath. The Riders must have left 
their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They 
will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and probably 
that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before 




we leave Bree.' 

'What will happen?' said Merry. 'Will they attack the inn?' 'No, I 
think not,' said Strider. 'They are not all here yet. And in any case that 
is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not 
openly attack a house where there are lights and many people -not until they 
are desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before 
us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their 
clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of 
the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at 
West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when 
they 

left him.' 

'We seem to have enemies all round,' said Frodo. 'What are we to do?' 

'Stay here, and do not go to your rooms ! They are sure to have found 
out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close 
to the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and the door. 
But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.' 

While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that 
had happened since supper. Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's 
letter when Strider and Nob returned. 

'Well Masters,' said Nob, 'I've ruffled up the clothes and put in a 
bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your 
head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag - Underhill, sir,' he added with a 
grin. 

Pippin laughed. 'Very life-like!' he said. 'But what will happen when 
they have penetrated the disguise?' 

'We shall see,' said Strider. 'Fet us hope to hold the fort till 
morning.' 

'Good night to you,' said Nob, and went off to take his part in the 
watch on the doors. 

Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low 
chair against the door and shut the window. Peering out, Frodo saw that the 
night was still clear. The Sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of 
Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the 
curtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles. 

The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the 
hearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door. They 




talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask. 

'Jumped over the Moon!' chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his 
blanket. 'Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish I had been there to see. 
The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence.' 

'I hope so,' said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one 
the hobbits dropped off to sleep. 




Chapter 11. A Knife in the Dark 



As they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on 
Buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river -bank. The house at 
Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered 
out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to 
rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air. 

As he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the 
gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound. 
Terror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in 
the hall. Then he shut and locked the door. 

The night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with 
stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and three black 
figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went 
to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they 
stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. The 
house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly. 

There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. The 
cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the door moved. In the dark 
without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been 
unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered. 

'Open, in the name of Mordor!' said a voice thin and menacing. 

At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and 
lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in. 

At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent the 
night like fire on a hill -top. 

AWAKE! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! AWAKE! 

Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep 
from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish. And run he did, 
out of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields. When he 
reached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the 
doorstep. 'No, no, no!' he was crying. 'No, not me! I haven't got it!' It 
was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about. 
At 

last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange invasion 




from the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time. 

FEAR! FIRE! FOES! 

The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that had not 
been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolves came in the 
Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over. 

AWAKE! AWAKE! 

Far-away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading. The black 
figures fled from the house. One of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the 
step, as he ran. In the lane the noise of hoofs broke out, and gathering to 
a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. All about Crickhollow there 
was the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the 
Black Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow! 
Sauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they 
knew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone. They rode down 
the 

guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire. 

In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some 
sound or presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider was sitting alert 
in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been 
tended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement. 

Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with 
the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed to be curling 
round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. 

He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard. 
Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang. 

The first grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming 
through the open window. 

As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their 
bedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice: 
the windows had been forced open and were swinging, and the curtains were 
flapping; the beds were tossed about, and the bolsters slashed and flung 
upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces. 

Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur 
looked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he 
said), but he had never heard a sound. 

'Never has such a thing happened in my time!' he cried, raising his 
hands in horror. ’Guests unable to sleep in their beds, and good bolsters 




ruined and all! What are we coming to?' 

'Dark times,' said Strider. 'But for the present you may be left in 
peace, when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once. Never mind about 
breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do. We shall be packed 
in a few minutes.' 

Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and 
to fetch them a 'bite'. But very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had 
vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in the night, and they were 
gone: not only Merry's ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place. 

Frodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reach Rivendell 
on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They might as well set out for the 
Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was 
weighing up their strength and courage. 

'Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,' he said at last, 
thoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. 'We should not go 
much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take. I was going to 
walk in any case. It is the food and stores that trouble me. We cannot count 
on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take 
with us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or 
forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way. How much are you 
prepared to carry on your backs?' 

'As much as we must,' said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to 
show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt). 

'I can carry enough for two,' said Sam defiantly. 

'Can't anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?' asked Frodo. 'Can't we get a 
couple of ponies in the village, or even one just for the baggage? I don't 
suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy them,' he added, 
doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it. 

'I doubt it,' said the landlord unhappily. 'The two or three 
riding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, and they're 
gone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there 
are very few of them in Bree, and they won't be for sale. But I'll do what I 
can. I'll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be.' 

'Yes,' said Strider reluctantly, 'you had better do that. I am afraid 
we shall have to try to get one pony at least. But so ends all hope of 
starting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a 
horn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, no doubt.' 




'There is one crumb of comfort,' said Merry, 'and more than a crumb, I 
hope: we can have breakfast while we wait - and sit down to it. Let's get 
hold of Nob!' 

In the end there was more than three hours' delay. Bob came back with 
the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the 
neighbourhood - except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell. 

'A poor old half-starved creature it is,' said Bob; 'but he won't part with 
it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you're placed, not if I knows 
Bill Ferny.' 

'Bill Ferny?' said Frodo. 'Isn't there some trick? Wouldn't the beast 
bolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?' 

'I wonder,' said Strider. 'But I cannot imagine any animal running home 
to him, once it got away. I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind 
Master Ferny's: just a way of increasing his profits from the affair. The 
chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death's door. But there 
does not seem any choice. What does he want for it?' 

Bill Ferny's price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at 
least three times the pony's value in those pans. It proved to be a bony, 
underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet. 

Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another eighteen pence 
as some compensation for the lost animals. He was an honest man, and 
well-off as things were reckoned in Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a 
sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear. 

Asa matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It turned 
out later that only one horse had been actually stolen. The others had been 
driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different 
corners of the Bree-land. Merry's ponies had escaped altogether, and 
eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in 
search of Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a 
while, and were well-off. But when news of the events at Bree came to Tom's 
ears, he sent them to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very 
fair price. They had to work harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well; so 
on the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey. But 
they never came to Rivendell. 

However, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone 
for good, or for bad. And he had other troubles. For there was a great 
commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the 




raid on the inn. The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed 
the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had 
also disappeared in the night, none other than Bill Ferny's squint-eyed 
companion. Suspicion fell on him at once. 

'If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,' said 
Butterbur angrily, 'you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not 
come shouting at me. Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is!' But it 
appeared that he was nobody's friend, and nobody could recollect when he had 
joined their party. 

After their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together 
further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting. It was 
close on ten o'clock before they at last got off. By that time the whole of 
Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo's vanishing trick; the appearance of 
the black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that 
Strider the Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as 
would last for many uneventful years. Most of the inhabitants of Bree and 
Staddle, and many even from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the road 
to 

see the travellers start. The other guests in the inn were at the doors or 
hanging out of the windows. 

Strider had changed his mind, and he decided to leave Bree by the main 
road. Any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters 
worse: half the inhabitants would follow them, to see what they were up to, 
and to prevent them from trespassing. 

They said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr. Butterbur with 
many thanks. 'I hope we shall meet again some day, when things are merry 
once more,' said Frodo. 'I should like nothing better than to stay in your 
house in peace for a while.' 

They tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd. 
Not all the faces were friendly, nor all the words that were shouted. But 
Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that 
he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in front with Frodo; 
next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was 
laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but 
already it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its 
fortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of 
them: a parting present from Nob and Bob. 'Apples for walking, and a pipe 




for sitting,' he said. 'But I reckon I'll miss them both before long.' 

The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of 
doors, or popped over walls and fences, as they passed. But as they drew 
near to the further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick 
hedge: the last house in the village. In one of the windows he caught a 
glimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once. 

'So that's where that southerner is hiding!' he thought. 'He looks more 
than half like a goblin.' 

Over the hedge another man was staring boldly. He had heavy black 
brows, and dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer. He was 
smoking a short black pipe. As they approached he took it out of his mouth 
and spat. 

'Morning, Longshanks!' he said. 'Off early? Found some friends at 
last?' Strider nodded, but did not answer. 'Morning, my little friends!' he 
said to the others. 'I suppose you know who you've taken up with? That's 
Stick -at-naught Strider, that is! Though I've heard other names not so 
pretty. Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don't go ill-treating my poor 
old pony! Pah!' He spat again. 

Sam turned quickly. 'And you. Ferny,' he said, 'put your ugly face out 
of sight, or it will get hurt.' With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an 
apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose. He ducked too late, and 
curses came from behind the hedge. 'Waste of a good apple,' said Sam 
regretfully, and strode on. 

At last they left the village behind. The escort of children and 
stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the 
South-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some miles. It 
bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet 
of Bree-hill, and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded 
country. To their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit -holes of 
Staddle on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in a deep 
hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed 
where Combe lay; 

Archet was hidden in the trees beyond. 

After the Road had run down some way, and had left Bree-hill standing 
tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards the 
North. 'This is where we leave the open and take to cover,' said Strider. 

'Not a "short cut", I hope,' said Pippin. 'Our last short cut through 




woods nearly ended in disaster.' 

'Ah, but you had not got me with you then,' laughed Strider. 'My cuts, 
short or long, don't go wrong.' He took a look up and down the Road. No one 
was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley. 

His plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the 
country, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on 
the east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to 
Weathertop Hill. In that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great 
loop of the Road, which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater 
Marshes. But, of course, they would have to pass through the marshes 
themselves, and Strider's description of them was not encouraging. 

However, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. Indeed, if it 
had not been for the disturbing events of the night before, they would have 
enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time. The sun was 
shining, clear but not too hot. The woods in the valley were still leafy and 
full of colour, and seemed peaceful and wholesome. Strider guided them 
confidently among the many crossing paths, although left to themselves they 
would soon have been at a loss. He was taking a wandering course with many 
turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit. 

'Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,' he 
said; 'though I don't think he will follow us himself. He knows the land 
round here well enough, but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood. It 
is what he may tell others that I am afraid of. I don't suppose they are far 
away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better.' 

Whether because of Strider's skill or for some other reason, they saw 
no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day: neither 
two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox and a few 
squirrels. The next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards; and 
still all was quiet and peaceful. On the third day out from Bree they came 
out of the Chetwood. The land had been falling steadily, ever since they 
turned aside from the Road, and they now entered a wide flat expanse of 
country, much more difficult to manage. They were far beyond the borders of 
the Bree-land, out in the pathless wilderness, and drawing near to the 
Midge- water Marshes. 

The ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they 
came upon pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the 
warbling of little hidden birds. They had to pick their way carefully to 




keep both dry-footed and on their proper course. At first they made 
fan-progress, but as they went on, their passage became slower and more 
dangerous. The marshes were bewildering and treacherous, and there was no 
permanent trail even for Rangers to find through their shifting quagmires. 

The flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds of tiny 
midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair. 

'I am being eaten alive!' cried Pippin. 'Midgewater! There are more 
midges than water!' 

'What do they live on when they can't get hobbit?' asked Sam, 
scratching his neck. 

They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. Their 
camping-place was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the biting insects 
would not let them sleep. There were also abominable creatures haunting the 
reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the 
cricket. There were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round, 
neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were 
nearly frantic. 

The next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as 
comfortless. Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) had been left 
behind, the midges still pursued them. 

As Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that 
far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many 
times. It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off. 

'What is the light?' he said to Strider, who had risen, and was 
standing, gazing ahead into the night. 

'I do not know,' Strider answered. 'It is too distant to make out. It 
is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.' 

Frodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white 
flashes, and against them the tall dark figure of Strider, standing silent 
and watchful. At last he passed into uneasy sleep. 

They had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last 
straggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind them. The land before 
them began steadily to rise again. Away in the distance eastward they could 
now see a line of hills. The highest of them was at the right of the line 
and a little separated from the others. It had a conical top, slightly 
flattened at the summit. 

'That is Weathertop,' said Strider. 'The Old Road, which we have left 




far away on our right, runs to the south of it and passes not far from its 
foot. We might reach it by noon tomorrow, if we go straight towards it. I 
suppose we had better do so.' 

’What do you mean?' asked Frodo. 

'I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. It 
is close to the Road.' 

'But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?' 

'Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not 
pass through Bree, and so he may not know what we are doing. And anyway, 
unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; it will 
not be safe for him or for us to wait there long. If the Riders fail to find 
us in the wilderness, they are likely to make for Weathertop themselves. It 
commands a wide view all round. Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in 
this country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. Not 
all the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than 
they are.' 

The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam looked up into 
the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright 
unfriendly eyes. 'You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome, Strider!' 
he said. 

'What do you advise us to do?' asked Frodo. 

'I think,' answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, 'I 
think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can, to 
make for the line of hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike a path I 
know that runs at their feet; it will bring us to Weathertop from the north 
and less openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.' 

All that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening came 
down. The land became drier and more barren; but mists and vapours lay 
behind them on the marshes. A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing, 
until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty 
silence fell. The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing 
through the cheerful windows of Bag End far away. 

At the day's end they came to a stream that wandered down from the 
hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland, and they went up along its 
banks while the light lasted. It was already night when at last they halted 
and made their camp under some stunted alder -trees by the shores of the 
stream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless 




backs of the hills. That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did 
not sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and in the early night -hours a cold 
grey light lay on the land. 

Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There was a frost 
in the air, and the sky was a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, 
as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used 
to much walking on short commons - shorter at any rate than what in the 
Shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs. 
Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been. 

'Very odd,' said Frodo, tightening his belt, 'considering that there is 
actually a good deal less of me. I hope the thinning process will not go on 
indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.' 

'Do not speak of such things!' said Strider quickly, and with 
surprising earnestness. 

The hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising 
almost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or 
passes leading into the eastern land beyond. Along the crest of the ridge 
the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and 
dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone. 

By night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes, and there they 
camped. It was the night of the fifth of October, and they were six days out 
from Bree. 

In the morning they found, for the first time since they had left the 
Chetwood, a track plain to see. They turned right and followed it 
southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep 
as much hidden as possible from the view, both of the hill-tops above and of 
the flats to the west. It dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and 
where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there 
were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers 
almost like a hedge. 

'I wonder who made this path, and what for,' said Merry, as they walked 
along one of these avenues, where the stones were unusually large and 
closely set. 'I am not sure that I like it: it has a - well, rather a 
barrow- wightish look. Is there any barrow on Weathertop?' 

'No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills,' 
answered Strider. 'The Men of the West did not live here; though in their 
latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came 




out of Angmar. This path was made to serve the forts along the walls. But 
long before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they built a great 
watch-tower on Weathertop, Amon Syl they called it. It was burned and 
broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown 
on the old hill's head. Yet once it was tall and fair. It is told that 
Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in 
the days of the Last Alliance.' 

The hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he was learned in old 
lore, as well as in the ways of the wild. 'Who was Gil-galad?' asked Merry; 
but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low 
voice murmured: 

Gil-galad was an Elven-king. 

Of him the harpers sadly sing: 

the last whose realm was fair and free 

between the Mountains and the Sea. 

His sword was long, his lance was keen, 
his shining helm afar was seen; 
the countless stars of heaven's field 
were mirrored in his silver shield. 

But long ago he rode away, 
and where he dwelleth none can say; 
for into darkness fell his star 
in Mordor where the shadows are. 

The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam's. 

'Don't stop!' said Merry. 

'That's all I know,' stammered Sam, blushing. 'I learned it from Mr. 

Bilbo when I was a lad. He used to tell me tales like that, knowing how I 
was always one for hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo as taught me my 
letters. He was mighty book -learned was dear old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote 
poetry. He wrote what I have just said.' 

'He did not make it up,' said Strider. 'It is pan of the lay that is 
called The Fall of Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have 
translated it. I never knew that.' 

'There was a lot more,' said Sam, 'all about Mordor. I didn't learn 
that part, it gave me the shivers I never thought I should be going that way 




myself!' 

’Going to Mordor!' cried Pippin. 'I hope it won't come to that!' 

'Do not speak that name so loudly!' said Strider. 

It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the 
path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the October sun, a 
grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the 
hill They decided to make for the top at once, while the daylight was broad 
Concealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy 
or spy was observing them. Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill. If 
Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him. 

On the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at 
the bottom of which there was a bowl -shaped dell with grassy sides. There 
they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage. The 
other three went on. After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached the 
crown of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last 
slope had been steep and rocky. 

On the top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring of ancient 
stonework, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass. But in the centre a 
cairn of broken stones had been piled. They were blackened as if with fire. 
About them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the 
grass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hill-top; but 
there was no sign of any living thing. 

Standing upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round below 
them a wide prospect, for the most pan of lands empty and featureless, 
except for patches of woodland away to the south, beyond which they caught 
here and there the glint of distant water. Beneath them on this southern 
side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road, coming out of the West and 
winding up and down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east. 
Nothing was moving on it. Following its line eastward with their eyes they 
saw the Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; 

behind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind those again were 
high white peaks glimmering among the clouds. 

'Well, here we are!' said Merry. 'And very cheerless and uninviting it 
looks! There is no water and no shelter. And no sign of Gandalf. But I don't 
blame him for not waiting - if he ever came here.' 

'I wonder,' said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. 'Even if he was a 
day or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first. He can ride 




very swiftly when need presses.’ Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone 
on the top of the cairn; it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as if 
it had escaped the fire. He picked it up and examined it, turning it in his 
fingers. "This has been handled recently,' he said. 'What do you think of 
these marks?' 

On the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches: 'There seems to he a 
stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,' he said. 

'The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin branches,' said 
Strider. 'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The 
scratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh. But the marks might mean 
something quite different, and have nothing to do with us. Rangers use 
runes, and they come here sometimes.' 

'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?' asked Merry 

'I should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and were a 
sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now. 

It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he 
had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is 
so, we must be wary.' 

'I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may 
mean,' said Frodo 'It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the 
way, in front of us or behind us.' 

'Perhaps,' said Strider. 'For myself, I believe that he was here, and 
was in danger. There have been scorching flames here; and now the light that 
we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind. I guess 
that he was attacked on this hill-top, but with what result I cannot tell. 

He is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own 
way to Rivendell, as best we can ' 

'How far is Rivendell?' asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world 
looked wild and wide from Weathertop. 

'I don't know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the 
Forsaken Inn, a day's journey east of Bree,' answered Strider. 'Some say it 
is so far, and some say otherwise. It is a strange road, and folk are glad 
to reach their journey's end, whether the time is long or short. But I know 
how long it would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill 
fortune twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses 
the Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell. We have at least a fortnight's 
journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road.' 




'A fortnight!' said Frodo. 'A lot may happen in that time.' 

'It may,' said Strider. 

They stood for a while silent on the hill -top, near its southward edge. 

In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his 
homelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in 
the quiet and beloved Shire. He stared down at the hateful Road, leading 
back westward - to his home. Suddenly he was aware that two black specks 
were moving slowly along it, going westward; and looking again he saw that 
three others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave a cry and clutched 
Strider's arm. 

'Look,' he said, pointing downwards. 

At once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, 
pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside. 

'What is it?' he whispered. 

'I do not know, but I fear the worst,' answered Strider. 

Slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and peered 
through a cleft between two jagged stones. The light was no longer bright, 
for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now 
overtaken the sun, as it began to go down. They could all see the black 
specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; 
yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling 
on the Road beyond the foot of the hill. 

'Yes,' said Strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. 'The 
enemy is here!' 

Hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to 
find their companions. 

Sam and Peregrin had not been idle. They had explored the small dell 
and the surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a spring of clear water 
in the hillside, and near it footprints not more than a day or two old. In 
the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a 
hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to 
the hill. Behind them Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly 
stacked. 

'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin. 'Whoever it 
was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.' 

Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries. 'I wish I had 
waited and explored the ground down here myself,' he said, hurrying off to 




the spring to examine the footprints. 

'It is just as I feared,' he said, when he came back. 'Sam and Pippin 
have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. Rangers 
have been here lately. It is they who left the firewood behind. But there 
are also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers. At least one 
set was made, only a day or two ago, by heavy boots. At least one. I cannot 
now be certain, but I think there were many booted feet.' He paused and 
stood in anxious thought. 

Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted 
Riders. If the horsemen had already found the dell, the sooner Strider led 
them somewhere else the better. Sam viewed the hollow with great dislike, 
now that he had heard news of their enemies on the Road, only a few miles 
away. 

'Hadn't we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?' he asked impatiently. 

'It is getting late, and I don't like this hole: it makes my heart sink 
somehow.' 

'Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,' answered Strider, 
looking up and considering the time and the weather. 'Well, Sam,' he said at 
last, 'I do not like this place either; but I cannot think of anywhere 
better that we could reach before nightfall. At least we are out of sight 
for the moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen 
spies. All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on 
this side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is 
here. The Road is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried to 
take cover in the thickets away to the south. On the north side of the Road 
beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles.' 

'Can the Riders see ?' asked Merry. 'I mean, they seem usually to have 
used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the 
right word, at least in the daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you 
saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.' 

'I was too careless on the hill-top,' answered Strider. 'I was very 
anxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us 
to go up and stand there so long. For the black horses can see, and the 
Riders can use men and other creatures as spies, as we found at Bree. They 
themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast 
shadows in their minds, which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark 
they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us: then they are 




most to be feared. And at all times they smell the blood of living things, 
desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other than sight or smell. We 
can feel their presence - it troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, 
and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,' he added, and his 
voice sank to a whisper, 'the Ring draws them.' 

'Is there no escape then?' said Frodo, looking round wildly. 'If I move 
I shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them to me!' 

Strider laid his hand on his shoulder. 'There is still hope,' he said. 

'You are not alone. Let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as 
a sign. There is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall serve for 
both. Sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these 
Riders do not love it, and fear those who wield it. Fire is our friend in 
the wilderness.' 

'Maybe,' muttered Sam. 'It is also as good a way of saying "here we 
are" as I can think of, bar shouting.' 

Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a 
fire, and prepared a meal. The shades of evening began to fall, and it grew 
cold. They were suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had not eaten 
anything since breakfast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper. 
The lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly places 
deserted by all the races of the world. Rangers passed at times beyond the 
hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of 
evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of 
the Misty Mountains. Only on the Road would travellers be found, most often 
dwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help and few 
words to spare for strangers. 

'I don't see how our food can be made to last,' said Frodo. 'We have 
been careful enough in the last few days, and this supper is no feast; but 
we have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks still to go, and 
perhaps more.' 

'There is food in the wild,' said Strider; 'berry, root, and herb; and 
I have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not be afraid of starving 
before winter comes. But gathering and catching food is long and weary work, 
and we need haste. So tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables 
of Elrond's house!' 

The cold increased as darkness came on. Peering out from the edge of 
the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into 




shadow. The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling 
stars. Frodo and his companions huddled round the fire, wrapped in every 
garment and blanket they possessed; but Strider was content with a single 
cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe. 

As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he 
began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear. He knew many 
histories and legends of long ago, of Elves and Men and the good and evil 
deeds of the Elder Days. They wondered how old he was, and where he had 
learned all this lore. 

Tell us of Gil-galad,’ said Merry suddenly, when he paused at the end 
of a story of the Elf-Kingdoms. 'Do you know any more of that old lay that 
you spoke of?' 

'I do indeed,' answered Strider. 'So also does Frodo, for it concerns 
us closely.' Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo, who was staring into the 
fire. 

'I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,' said Frodo slowly. 
'Gil-galad was the last of the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth. Gil-galad is 
Starlight in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elf-friend, he went to the land 
of ' 

'No!' said Strider interrupting, 'I do not think that tale should be 
told now with the servants of the Enemy at hand. If we win through to the 
house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.' 

'Then tell us some other tale of the old days,' begged Sam; 'a tale 
about the Elves before the fading time. I would dearly like to hear more 
about Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.' 

'I will tell you the tale of Tin®viel,' said Strider, 'in brief - for 
it is a long tale of which the end is not known; and there are none now, 
except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old. It is a fair 
tale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet it may 
lift up your hearts.' He was silent for some time, and then he began not to 
speak but to chant softly: 

The leaves were long, the grass was green, 

The hemlock-umbels tall and fair, 

And in the glade a light was seen 

Of stars in shadow shimmering. 

Tin®viel was dancing there 

To music of a pipe unseen, 




And light of stars was in her hair, 

And in her raiment glimmering. 

There Beren came from mountains cold, 
And lost he wandered under leaves, 

And where the Elven-river rolled 
He walked alone and sorrowing. 

He peered between the hemlock-leaves 
And saw in wander flowers of gold 
Upon her mantle and her sleeves, 

And her hair like shadow following. 

Enchantment healed his weary feet 
That over hills were doomed to roam; 

And forth he hastened, strong and fleet, 
And grasped at moonbeams glistening. 
Through woven woods in Elvenhome 
She tightly fled on dancing feet, 

And left him lonely still to roam 
In the silent forest listening. 

He heard there oft the flying sound 
Of feet as light as linden-leaves, 

Or music welling underground, 

In hidden hollows quavering. 

Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, 
And one by one with sighing sound 
Whispering fell the beechen leaves 
In the wintry woodland wavering. 

He sought her ever, wandering far 
Where leaves of years were thickly strewn, 
By light of moon and ray of star 
In frosty heavens shivering. 

Her mantle glinted in the moon, 

As on a hill-top high and far 

She danced, and at her feet was strewn 




A mist of silver quivering. 



When winter passed, she came again, 
And her song released the sudden spring, 
Like rising lark, and falling rain, 

And melting water bubbling. 

He saw the elven-flowers spring 
About her feet, and healed again 
He longed by her to dance and sing 
Upon the grass untroubling. 

Again she fled, but swift he came. 
Tin®viel! Tin®viel! 

He called her by her elvish name; 

And there she halted listening. 

One moment stood she, and a spell 
His voice laid on her: Beren came, 

And doom fell on Tin®viel 
That in his arms lay glistening. 

As Beren looked into her eyes 
Within the shadows of her hair, 

The trembling starlight of the skies 
He saw there mirrored shimmering. 
Tin®viel the elven-fair, 

Immortal maiden elven-wise, 

About him cast her shadowy hair 
And arms like silver glimmering. 

Long was the way that fate them bore, 
O'er stony mountains cold and grey, 
Through halls of iron and darkling door, 
And woods of nightshade morrowless. 
The Sundering Seas between them lay, 
And yet at last they met once more, 

And long ago they passed away 
In the forest singing sorrowless. 




Strider sighed and paused before he spoke again. ’That is a song,' he 
said, 'in the mode that is called ann-thennath among the Elves, but is hard 
to render in our Common Speech, and this is but a rough echo of it. It tells 
of the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and L®thien Tin®viel. Beren was a 
mortal man, but L®thien was the daughter of Thingol, a King of Elves upon 
Middle-earth when the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that 
has ever been among all the children of this world. As the stars above the 
mists of the Northern lands was her loveliness, and in her face was a 
shining light. In those days the Great Enemy, of whom Sauron of Mordor was 
but a servant, dwelt in Angband in the North, and the Elves of the West 
coming back to Middle-earth made war upon him to regain the Silmarils which 
he had stolen; and the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the Enemy was 
victorious and Barahir was slain, and Beren escaping through great peril 
came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in the 
forest of Neldoreth. There he beheld L®thien singing and dancing in a glade 
beside the enchanted river Esgalduin; and he named her Tin®viel, that is 
Nightingale in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and 
they were parted long. Tin®viel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron, 
and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great 
Enemy from his throne, and took from his iron crown one of the three 
Silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price of L®thien to 
Thingol her father. Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came 
from the gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of Tin®viel. But she 
chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow him; 
and it is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering Seas, and after a 
brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, 
long ago, beyond the confines of this world. So it is that L®thien Tin®viel 
alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have 
lost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of 
old descended among Men. There live still those of whom L®thien was the 
foremother, and it is said that her line shall never fail. Elrond of 
Rivendell is of that Kin. For of Beren and L®thien was born Dior Thingol’s 
heir; and of him Elwing the White whom Edrendil wedded, he that sailed his 
ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril 
upon his brow. And of Edrendil came the Kings of N®menor, that is 
Westernesse.' 

As Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit 




in the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes shone, and his voice was rich and 
deep. Above him was a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over 
the crown of Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon was climbing 
slowly 

above the hill that overshadowed them, and the stars above the hill-top 
faded. 

The story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. 'Look!' said Merry. 
'The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.' 

The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the 
hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise. It was 
perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light. 

Sam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo and Pippin 
remained seated in silence. Strider was watching the moonlight on the hill 
intently. All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping 
over his heart, now that Strider was no longer speaking. He huddled closer 
to the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell. 

'I don't know what it is,' he said, 'but I suddenly felt afraid. I 
durstn't go outside this dell for any money; I felt that something was 
creeping up the slope.' 

'Did you see anything?' asked Frodo, springing to his feet. 

'No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn't stop to look.' 

'I saw something,' said Merry; 'or I thought I did - away westwards 
where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the 
hill-tops, I thought there were two or three black shapes. They seemed to be 
moving this way.' 

'Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!' cried Strider. 'Get 
some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!' 

For a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with their 
backs turned to the wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled 
them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or movement in the night. 
Frodo 

stirred, feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out 
aloud. 

'Hush!' whispered Strider. 'What's that?' gasped Pippin at the same 
moment. 

Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they 
felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They 




strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no 
doubt: 

three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, 
looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes 
in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as 
of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly 
advanced. 

Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the 
ground. Sam shrank to Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his 
companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was 
swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring. The desire to do 
this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. Fie did not forget 
the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be 
compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with 
the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt 
that he must take the Ring and put it on his finger. Fie could not speak. Fie 
felt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great 
trouble, but he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled 
for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly drew 
out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand. 

Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, 
the shapes became terribly clear. He was able to see beneath their black 
wrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the 
dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; 
under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms 
of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel. Their eyes fell on 
him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own 
sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. 

Two of the figures halted. The third was taller than the others: his hair 
was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a 
long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held 
it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo. 

At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard 
himself crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At the same time he struck at 
the feet of his enemy. A shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a 
pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he 
swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse of Strider leaping 




out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last 
effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped the Ring from his finger and 
closed his right hand tight upon it. 




Chapter 12 . Flight to the Ford 



When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately. 

He was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning brightly. His 
three companions were bending over him. 'What has happened? Where is the 
pale king?' he asked wildly. They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to 
answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he 
gathered from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes 
coming towards them. Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had 
vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He 
heard Frodo’s voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from 
under the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they 
stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the 
grass with his sword beneath him. Strider ordered them to pick him up and 
lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a good while 
ago. 

Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while 
they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows. They 
started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down 
swiftly at his side. 

'I am not a Black Rider, Sam,' he said gently, 'nor in league with 
them. I have been trying to discover something of their movements; but I 
have found nothing. I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack 
again. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.' 

When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and 
shook his head and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much 
water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. 

'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!' he said. Then he got up and 
walked away, and called Sam to him. 'I think I understand things better 
now,' he said in a low voice. 'There seem only to have been five of the 
enemy. Why they were not all here, I don't know; but I don't think they 
expected to be resisted. They have drawn off for the time being. But not 
far, I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They 
are only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost 
accomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that 




they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their 
will. We shall see!' Sam choked with tears. 'Don't despair!' said Strider. 

'You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had 
guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and 
I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies 
expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am 
away!' He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness. 

Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a 
deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His 
friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound. The night 
passed slowly and wearily. Dawn was growing in the sky, and the dell was 
filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned. 

'Look!' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak 
that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there 
was a slash. 'This was the stroke of Frodo's sword,' he said. 'The only hurt 
that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish 
that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of 
Elbereth.' 

'And more deadly to Frodo was this!' He stooped again and lifted up a 
long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw 
that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off. But 
even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for 
the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only 
the hilt in Strider's hand. 'Alas!' he cried. 'It was this accursed knife 
that gave the wound. Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil 
weapons. But I will do what I can.' 

He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger -hilt laid it on his 
knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it 
aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could 
not catch. From the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a 
plant. 

'These leaves,' he said, 'I have walked far to find; for this plant 
does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the Road 
I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.' He crushed a leaf in his 
fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. 'It is fortunate 
that I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West 
brought to Middle-earth. Athelas they named it, and it grows now sparsely 




and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known 
in the North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It has great 
virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.' 

He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo's shoulder. The 
fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their 
minds calmed and cleared. The herb had also some power over the wound, for 
Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; 
but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his 
hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for 
weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed 
not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he 
would remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue 
their journey. He fell too weak to stand. 

The others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided to 
leave Weathertop as soon as possible. 'I think now,' said Strider, 'that the 
enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, 
then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return. In any 
case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, 
and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.' 

As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and 
packed. It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater 
part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony. In 
the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed 
fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, 
especially for Sam. Bill Ferny's treatment must have been very hard for the 
journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life. 

They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the 
Road, but. it was the quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed 
fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, 
while fire would be some protection for them all. It was also his plan to 
shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east 
beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards. 

They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western 
slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of the Road. 

There was no sign of the Riders. But even as they were hurrying across they 
heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering. 
Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The 




land before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; 
bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in 
between. The grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the 
thickets were faded and falling. It was a cheerless land, and their journey 
was slow and gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo's heart 
was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, 
and 

their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider seemed tired and 
heavy-hearted. 

Before the first day's march was over Frodo's pain began to grow again, 
but he did not speak of it for a long time. Four days passed, without the 
ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop 
slowly 

sank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet 
since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked 
their flight or followed them. They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch 
in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the 
grey night, dimly lit by the cloud- veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and 
heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did they 
feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in 
the dell. It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their 
trail again. Perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow 
place? 

At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly 
out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended. Strider now 
turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached 
the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded 
hills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of 
the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin 
sunshine. In the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley 
half-veiled in mist. 

"I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,' said 
Strider. 'We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the Elves call 
Mitheithel. It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of 
Rivendell, and joins the Loud water away in the South. Some call it the 
Greyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the Sea. There is 
no way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors, except by the Last 




Bridge on which the Road crosses.' 

’What is that other river we can see far away there?' asked Merry. 

'That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,' answered Strider. 'The 
Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the 
Ford of Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water. 
One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last 
Bridge held against us.' 

Next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of 
the Road. Sam and Strider went forward, but they found no sign of any 
travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some 
rain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away 
all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see. 

They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile 
or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope. 
They dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider 
made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went 
forward to explore. 

Before long he came hurrying back. 'I can see no sign of the enemy,' he 
said, 'and I wonder very much what that means. But I have found something 
very strange.' 

He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. 'I found it 
in the mud in the middle of the Bridge,' he said. 'It is a beryl, an 
elf-stone. Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I cannot say; 
but it brings hope to me. I will take it as a sign that we may pass the 
Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road, without some clearer 
token.' 

At once they went on again. They crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing 
no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches. A mile 
further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the 
steep lands on the left of the Road. Here Strider turned aside, and soon 
they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of 
sullen hills. 

The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous 
Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. As 
they went forward the hills about them steadily rose. Here and there upon 
heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the 
ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who was not walking, had 




time to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled Bilbo's account of his journey 
and the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road, in the country 
near the Troll's wood where his first serious adventure had happened. Frodo 
guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance 
they would pass near the spot. 

'Who lives in this land?' he asked. 'And who built these towers? Is 
this troll-country?' 

'No!' said Strider. 'Trolls do not build. No one lives in this land. 

Men once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now. They became an evil 
people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of Angmar. But all 
were destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to its end. But 
that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow 
still lies on the land.' 

'Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and 
forgetful?' asked Peregrin. 'The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that 
son.' 

'The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,' said Strider; 

'and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell.' 'Have 
you often been to Rivendell?' said Frodo. 'I have,' said Strider. 'I dwelt 
there once, and still I return when I may. 

There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the 
fair house of Elrond.' 

The hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on its way to 
the River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view. The travellers came 
into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent. Trees with old 
and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes 
of pine-wood. 

The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick 
their way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled 
rocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo's sake, and 
because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales. 

They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. The wind 
began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant 
seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain. By nightfall 
they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get 
any fire to burn. The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper 
before them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their 




course. Strider seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out 
from Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low. It 
went on raining. 

That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock -wall behind them, 
in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff. Frodo was 
restless. The cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and 
the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep. He lay tossing and 
turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks 
of rock, water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened 
stone. He felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him; but when he 
sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking 
his pipe, and watching. He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream, 
in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire, but it seemed 
faint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking 
over the hedge. 

In the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped. The clouds 
were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips of blue appeared 
between them. The wind was shifting again. They did not start early. 
Immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off 
alone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he 
came back. He was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie 
of the land. 

When he returned he was not reassuring. 'We have come too far to the 
north,' he said, 'and we must find some way to turn back southwards again. 

If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north 
of Rivendell. That is troll-country, and little known to me. We could 
perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but 
it would take too long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not 
last. So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen.' 

The rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They 
found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running 
south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of 
the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark 
edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a 
blunted saw. They had a choice between going back or climbing over it. 

They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before 
long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot. Even so they 




often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for 
themselves, burdened as they were. The light was nearly gone, and they were 
all exhausted, when at last they reached the top. They had climbed on to a 
narrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away 
again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the 
ground shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt 
as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks about him seemed 
shadowy and dim. 

'We cannot go any further,' said Merry to Strider. 'I am afraid this 
has been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully anxious about him. What are we 
to do? Do you think they will be able to cure him in Ri vendell, if we ever 
get there?' 

'We shall see,' answered Strider. 'There is nothing more that I can do 
in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so 
anxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further tonight.' 

'What is the matter with my master?' asked Sam in a low voice, looking 
appealingly at Strider. 'His wound was small, and it is already closed. 

There's nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.' 

'Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,' said Strider, 

'and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive 
out. But do not give up hope, Sam!' 

Night was cold up on the high ridge. They lit a small fire down under 
the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as 
if stone had once been quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind 
blew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning 
and sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings 
were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought 
him in all the hollows of the hill s. 

The morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light 
pale and clear in a rain- washed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, but (hey 
longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as it was light, 
Strider took Merry with him and went to survey the country from the height 
to the east of the pass. The sun had risen and was shining brightly when he 
returned with more comforting news. They were now going more or less in the 
right direction. If they went on, down the further side of the ridge, they 
would have the Mountains on their left. Some way ahead Strider had caught a 
glimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from 




view, the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side 
nearest to them. 

'We must make for the Road again,' he said. 'We cannot hope to find a 
path through these hills. Whatever danger may beset it, the Road is our only 
way to the Ford.' 

As soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly down 
the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had 
expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long 
Frodo was able to ride again. Bill Ferny's poor old pony was developing an 
unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many 
jolts as possible. The spirits of the party rose again. Even Frodo felt 
better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to 
obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes. 

Pippin was a little ahead of the others. Suddenly he turned round and 
called to them. 'There is a path here!' he cried. 

When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake: 

there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many 
windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind. In 
places it was now faint and overgrown, or choked with fallen stones and 
trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used. It was a path made 
by strong arms and heavy feet. Here and there old trees had been cut or 
broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way. 

They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest 
way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came 
into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer and broader. Suddenly coming 
out of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply 
to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill. When they came 
to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level 
strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees. In the stony wall 
there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge. 

Outside the door they all halted. There was a cave or rock-chamber 
behind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen. Strider, Sam, and 
Merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little 
wider, and then Strider and Merry went in. They did not go far, for on the 
floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance 
except some great empty jars and broken pots. 

'Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!' said Pippin. 




’Come out, you two, and let us get away. Now we know who made the path - 
and 

we had better get off it quick.’ 

'There is no need, I think,' said Strider, coining out. 'It is 
certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken. I don't 
think we need be afraid. But let us go on down warily, and we shall see.' 

The path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again 
across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking 
to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry. Sam and 
Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo's pony, for the path was now 
broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone 
very far before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry. They both 
looked terrified. 

'There are trolls!' Pippin panted. 'Down in a clearing in the woods not 
far below. We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. They are very 
large!' 

'We will come and look at them,' said Strider, picking up a stick. 

Frodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared. 

The sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped 
branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of light. 

They halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, 
holding their breath. There stood the trolls: three large trolls. One was 
stooping, and the other two stood staring at him. 

Strider walked forward unconcernedly. 'Get up, old stone!' he said, and 
broke his stick upon the stooping troll. 

Nothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, 
and then even Frodo laughed. 'Well!' he said. 'We are forgetting our family 
history! These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, 
quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.' 

'I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!' said Pippin. He knew 
the story well. Bilbo and Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact 
he had never more than half believed it. Even now he looked at the stone 
trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them 
to life again. 

'You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew 
about trolls,' said Strider. 'It is broad daylight with a bright sun, and 
yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for 




us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an 
old bird's nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a 
live troll!' 

They all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of 
Bilbo's first successful adventure was heartening. The sun, too, was warm 
and comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little. 
They rested for some time in the glade, and took their mid-day meal right 
under the shadow of the trolls' large legs. 

'Won't somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?' said 
Merry, when they had finished. 'We haven't had a song or a tale for days.' 

'Not since Weathertop,' said Frodo. The others looked at him. 'Don't 
worry about me!' he added. 'I feel much better, but I don't think I could 
sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory.' 

'Come on, Sam!' said Merry. 'There's more stored in your head than you 
let on about.' 

'I don't know about that,' said Sam. 'But how would this suit? It ain't 
what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense. But 
these old images here brought it to my mind.' Standing up, with his hands 
behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune. 

Troll sat alone on his seat of stone, 

And munched and mumbled a bare old bone; 

For many a year he had gnawed it near, 

For meat was hard to come by. 

Done by! Gum by! 

In a case in the hills he dwelt alone, 

And meat was hard to come by. 

Up came Tom with his big boots on. 

Said he to Troll: 'Pray, what is yon? 

For it looks like the shin o' my nuncle Tim, 

As should be a-lyin ' in graveyard. 

Caveyard! Paveyard! 

This many a year has Tim been gone, 

And I thought he were lyin ' in graveyard. ' 



'My lad, ' said Troll, 'this bone I stole. 
But what be bones that lie in a hole? 




Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o' lead, 

Afore I found his shinbone. 

Tinbone! Thinbone! 

He can spare a share for a poor old troll, 

For he don't need his shinbone. ' 

Said Tom: 7 don't see why the likes o' thee 
Without axin ' leave should go makin 'free 
With the shank or the shin o' my father's kin; 
So hand the old bone over! 

Rover! Trover! 

Though dead he be, it belongs to he; 

So hand the old bone over!' 

'For a couple o' pins,' says Troll, and grins, 
'I'll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins. 

A bit o' fresh meal will go down sweet! 

I'll try my teeth on thee now. 

Hee now! See now! 

I'm tired o' gnawing old bones and skins; 

I've a mind to dine on thee now. ' 

But just as he thought his dinner was caught, 
He found his hands had hold of naught. 

Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind 
And gave him the boot to lam him. 

Warn him! Darn him! 

A bump o' the boot on the seat, Tom thought, 
Would be the way to lam him. 

But harder than stone is the flesh and bone 
Of a troll that sits in the hills alone. 

As well set your boot to the mountain's root, 
For the seat of a troll don 't feel it. 

Peel it! Heal it! 

Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan, 
And he knew his toes could feel it. 




Tom's leg is game, since home he came, 

And his bootless foot is lasting lame; 

But Troll don't care, and he's still there 

With the bone he boned from its owner. 

Doner! Boner! 

Troll's old seat is still the same, 

And the bone he boned from its owner! 

'Well, that's a warning to us all!' laughed Merry. 'It is as well you 
used a stick, and not your hand, Strider!' 

'Where did you come by that, Sam?' asked Pippin. 'I've never heard 
those words before.' 

Sam muttered something inaudible. 'It's out of his own head, of 
course,' said Frodo. 'I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey. 
First he was a conspirator, now he's a jester. He'll end up by becoming a 
wizard - or a warrior!' 

'I hope not,' said Sam. 'I don't want to be neither!' 

In the afternoon they went on down the woods. They were probably 
following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many 
years before. After a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank 
above the Road. At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in 
its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and 
winding eastward among woods and heather -covered slopes towards the Ford 
and 

the Mountains. Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the 
grass. On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen 
dwarf-runes and secret marks. 

'There!' said Merry. 'That must be the stone that marked the place 
where the trolls' gold was hidden. How much is left of Bilbo's share, I 
wonder, Frodo?' 

Frodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought home no 
treasure more perilous, nor less easy to pan with. 'None at all,' he said. 

'Bilbo gave it all away. He told me he did not feel it was really his, as it 
came from robbers.' 

The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was 
no sign of any other travellers to be seen. As there was now no other 
possible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank, and turning 




left went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off 
the light of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to meet them 
from the mountains ahead. 

They were beginning to look out for a place off the Road, where they 
could camp for the night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear 
back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them. They looked back, 
but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the 
Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into 
the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came 
to a small patch of thick-growing hazels. As they peered out from among the 
bushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the failing light, some 
thirty feel below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They were going 
fast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. Then faintly, as if it was blown 
away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of 
small bells tinkling. 

That does not sound like a Black Rider's horse!' said Frodo, listening 
intently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all 
remained full of suspicion. They had been in fear of pursuit for so long 
that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly. But Strider was 
now leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a 
look of joy on his face. 

The light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. Clearer 
and nearer now the bells jingled, and clippety-clip came the quick trotting 
feet. Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, 
running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it 
were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind 
him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the 
wind of his speed. To Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining 
through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil. 

Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road, leaping 
with a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved or called, the 
rider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up towards the thicket 
where they stood. When he saw Strider, he dismounted and ran to meet him 
calling out: Ai na vedui D®nadan! Mae govannen! His speech and clear 
ringing 

voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk. No 
others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear. But there 




seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was 
now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider. 

Soon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the bushes and 
hurried down to the Road. 'This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of 
Elrond,' said Strider. 

'Hail, and well met at last!' said the Elf-lord to Frodo. 'I was sent 
from Rivendell to look for you. We feared that you were in danger upon the 
road.' 

'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?' cried Frodo joyfully. 

'No. He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,' answered 
Glorfindel. 'Elrond received news that troubled him. Some of my kindred, 
journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin,* learned that things were 
amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said that the Nine 
were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without 
guidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that 
can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out 
north, west, and south. It was thought that you might turn far aside to 
avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness. 

'It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of 
Mitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago. Three of the 
servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued 
them westward. I came also upon two others, but they turned away southward. 
Since then I have searched for your trail. Two days ago I found it, and 
followed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the 
hills again. But come! There is no time for further news. Since you are here 
we must risk the peril of the Road and go. There are five behind us, and 
when they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the 
wind. And they are not all. Where the other four may be, I do not know. I 
fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us.' 

While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened. Frodo 
felt a great weariness come over him. Ever since the sun began to sink the 
mist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt that a shadow was coming 
between him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt 
cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm. 

'My master is sick and wounded,' said Sam angrily. 'He can't go on 
riding after nightfall. He needs rest.' 

Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently 




in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety. 

Briefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop, and 
of the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it 
to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he looked intently at 
it. 

'There are evil things written on this hilt,' he said; 'though maybe 
your eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till we reach the house of 
Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of 
this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can - but all the 
more do I urge you now to go on without rest.' 

He searched the wound on Frodo's shoulder with his fingers, and his 
face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt the 
chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his 
shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The dusk of evening seemed 
to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. He saw his 
friends' faces more clearly again, and a measure of new hope and strength 
returned. 

'You shall ride my horse,' said Glorfindel. 'I will shorten the 
stirrups up to the saddle-skins, and you must sit as tight as you can. But 
you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I command him 
to bear. His pace is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he 
will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy 
cannot rival.' 

'No, he will not!' said Frodo. 'I shall not ride him, if I am to be 
carried off to Rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in 
danger.' 

Glorfindel smiled. 'I doubt very much,' he said, 'if your friends would 
be in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you and 
leave us in peace, I think. It is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that 
brings us all in peril.' 

To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel's 
white horse. The pony was laden instead with a great part of the others' 
burdens, so that they now marched lighter, and for a time made good speed; 
but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless 
feet of the Elf. On he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on 
under the deep clouded night. There was neither star nor moon. Not until the 
grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were by that 




time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the 
sag of his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream. 

They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the 
road-side, and fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to have closed 
their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while they slept, 
awoke them again. The sun had now climbed far into the morning, and the 
clouds and mists of the night were gone. 

'Drink this!' said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a 
little liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather. It was clear as 
spring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in 
the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as 
they drank it. Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit 
(which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better 
than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done. 

They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road 
again. Glorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed two brief halts 
during the day's march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before 
nightfall, and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down 
towards the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the Bruinen. So 
far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or 
hear; but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they 
lagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face. Once or twice he 
spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue. 

But however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the 
hobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with 
weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs. Frodo's 
pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows of 
ghostly grey. He almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world 
seemed less pale and empty. 

The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next 
morning. There were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and 
they 

hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage. 

'Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,' said 
Glorfindel; 'for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us, 
and other danger may be waiting by the Ford.' 

The Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in 




places much grass at either side, in which the hobbits walked when they 
could, to ease their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came to a place 
where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and 
then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes 
ran along as they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many 
footfalls following their own. All at once, as if through a gate of light, 
the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open. There at 
the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and 
beyond that the Ford of Rivendell. On the further side was a steep brown 
bank, threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains 
climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky. 

There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind 
them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the 
branches of the pines. One moment Glorfindel turned and listened, then he 
sprang forward with a loud cry. 

'Fly!' he called. 'Fly! The enemy is upon us!’ 

The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down the slope. 
Glorfindel and Strider followed as rear -guard. They were only half way 
across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of 
the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined 
his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, and 
then another; then again two more. 

’Ride forward! Ride!' cried Glorfindel to Frodo. 

He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking 
the horse to a walk, he turned and looked back. The Riders seemed to sit 
upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark and 
solid, while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist. 
Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to 
wait. Then at once fear and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle 
and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it. 

'Ride on! Ride on!' cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called 
to the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth! 

At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the 
last lap of the Road. At the same moment the black horses leaped down the 
hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had 
heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away. It was 
answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and 




rocks away on the left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards 
Frodo: two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his escape. They 
seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as 
their courses converged with his. 

Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no longer 
see his friends. The Riders behind were falling back: even their great 
steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of Glorfindel. He 
looked forward again, and hope faded. There seemed no chance of reaching the 
Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush. He could 
see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black 
cloaks, and they were robed in white and grey. Swords were naked in their 
pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, and they 
called to him with fell voices. 

Fear now filled all Frodo's mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No 
cry came from him. He shut his eyes and clung to the horse's mane. The wind 
whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill. A 
breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a 
flash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed right 
before the face of the foremost Rider. 

Frodo heard the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the 
quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony 
path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across the Ford. 

But the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the horse 
halted and turned about neighing fiercely. There were Nine Riders at the 
water's edge below, and Frodo's spirit quailed before the threat of their 
uplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as 
easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over 
the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the 
Riders crossed. In any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt. 
Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse. 

Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked at 
the water and reared up. With a great effort Frodo sat upright and 
brandished his sword. 

'Go back!' he cried. 'Go back to the Land of Mordor, and follow me no 
more! ' His voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears. The Riders 
halted, but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him 
with a harsh and chilling laughter. 'Come back! Come back!' they called. 'To 




Mordor we will take you!' 

’Go back!' he whispered. 

The Ring! The Ring!' they cried with deadly voices; and immediately 
their leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by two 
others. 

'By Elbereth and L®thien the Fair,' said Frodo with a last effort, 
lifting up his sword, 'you shall have neither the Ring nor me!' 

Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in 
his stirrups, and raised up his hand. Frodo was stricken dumb. He felt his 
tongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart labouring. His sword broke and 
fell out of his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared and snorted. The foremost 
of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore. 

At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud 
waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw the river below him rise, and 
down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves. White flames 
seemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw 
amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three 
Riders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed: they 
disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam. Those that were behind drew 
back in dismay. 

With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him 
that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure 
of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that 
flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world. 

The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in 
terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood. Their piercing cries 
were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away. Then Frodo 
felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and 
engulf him together with his enemies. He heard and saw no more. 




* BOOK II * 



Chapter 1 . Many Meetings 

Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he 
had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge 
of memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling looked strange; it 
was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer 
looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of a 
waterfall. 

'Where am I, and what is the time?' he said aloud to the ceiling. 'In 
the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning.' said a voice. 

'It is the morning of October the twenty -fourth, if you want to know.' 

'Gandalf!' cried Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting 
in a chair by the open window. 

'Yes,' he said, 'I am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after 
all the absurd things you have done since you left home.' Frodo lay down 
again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did 
not think he would get the better of an argument. He was fully awake now, 
and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous 'short cut' 
through the Old Forest the 'accident' at The Prancing Pony ; and his madness 
in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking 
of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his 
arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft 
puffs of Gandalf s pipe, as he blew white smoke -rings out of the window. 

'Where's Sam?' Frodo asked at length. 'And are the others all right?' 

'Yes, they are all safe and sound,' answered Gandalf. 'Sam was here 
until I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.' 

'What happened at the Ford?' said Frodo. 'It all seemed so dim somehow; 
and it still does.’ 

'Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade,' answered Gandalf. 'The 
wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and you would have 
been 

beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you 
showed in the Barrow. That was touch and go: perhaps the most dangerous 




moment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.' 

'You seem to know a great deal already,' said Frodo. 'I have not spoken 
to the others about the Barrow. At first it was too horrible; and afterwards 
there were other things to think about. How do you know about it?' 

'You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and 
it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory. Do not worry! 
Though I said "absurd" just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you-and 
of the others. It is no small feat to have come so far, and through such 
dangers, still bearing the Ring.' 

'We should never have done it without Strider,' said Frodo. 'But we 
needed you. I did not know what to do without you.' 

'I was delayed,' said Gandalf, 'and that nearly proved our ruin. And 
yet I am not sure; it may have been better so.' 

'I wish you would tell me what happened!' 

'All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything 
today, by Elrond's orders.' 

'But talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which are quite as 
tiring,’ said Frodo. ’I am wide awake now, and I remember so many things 
that want explaining. Why were you delayed? You ought to tell me that at 
least.' 

'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf. 'We shall have 
a Council, as soon as you are well enough. At the moment I will only say 
that I was held captive.' 

'You?' cried Frodo. 

'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,' said the wizard solemnly. 'There are many 
powers in the world, for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. 
Against some I have not yet been measured. But my time is coming. The 
Morgul-lord and his Black Riders have come forth. War is preparing!' 

'Then you knew of the Riders already -before I met them?’ 

'Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black 
Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings. But 
I did not know that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at 
once. I heard news of them only after I left you in June; but that story 
must wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.' 

'Yes,' said Frodo, 'it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid of 
him at first. Sam never quite trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we 
met Glorfindel.' 




Gandalf smiled. V I have heard all about Sam,' he said. 'He has no more 
doubts now.' 

'I am glad,' said Frodo. 'For I have become very fond of Strider. Well, 
fond is not the right word. I mean he is dear to me; though he is strange, 
and grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often of you. I didn't know that 
any of the Big People were like that. I thought, well, that they were just 
big, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked 
like Bill Ferny. But then we don't know much about Men in the Shire, except 
perhaps the Breelanders.' 

'You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is 
stupid,' said Gandalf. 'He is wise enough on his own ground. He thinks less 
than he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick wall in time (as 
they say in Bree). But there are few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son 
of Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It 
may be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure.' 

'Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old 
Kings?' said Frodo in wonder. 'I thought they had all vanished long ago. I 
thought he was only a Ranger.' 

'Only a Ranger!' cried Gandalf. 'My dear Frodo, that is just what the 
Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great people, the Men of 
the West. They have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the 
days to come; for we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at 
rest.' 

'I suppose not,' said Frodo. 'But so far my only thought has been to 
get here; and I hope I shan't have to go any further. It is very pleasant 
just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has 
been as much as I want.' 

He fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. 'I have 
been reckoning,' he said, 'and I can't bring the total up to October the 
twenty-fourth. It ought to be the twenty-first. We must have reached the 
Ford by the twentieth.' 

'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf. 
'How do the side and shoulder feel now?’ 

’I don't know.' Frodo answered. 'They don't feel at all: which is an 
improvement, but'— he made an effort— 'I can move my arm again a little. 
Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,' he added, touching his left 
hand with his right. 




'Good!' said Gandalf. "It is mending fast. You will soon be sound 
again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were 
brought in.' 

'Days?' said Frodo. 

'Well, four nights and three days, to be exact. The Elves brought you 
from this where you lost count. We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has 
hardly left your side, day or night, except to run messages. Elrond is a 
master of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the 
truth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some fragment 
of the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be found until last 
night. Then Elrond removed a splinter. It was deeply buried, and it was 
working inwards.' 

Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that 
had vanished in Strider's hands. 'Don't be alarmed!' said Gandalf. 'It is 
gone now. It has been melted. And it seems that Hobbits fade very 
reluctantly. I have known strong warriors of the Big People who would 
quickly have been overcome by that splinter, which you bore for seventeen 
days.’ 

'What would they have done to me?’ asked Frodo. 'What were the Riders 
trying to do?’ 

'They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in 
the wound. If they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only 
weaker and under their command. You would have became a wraith under 
the 

dominion of the Dark Lord; and he would have tormented you for trying to 
keep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it 
and seeing it on his hand.' 

'Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger!' said Frodo 
faintly. I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had known more, I should 
not have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I escaped!' 

'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf, 'not to mention 
courage. For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; 
and that was because you resisted to the last. But it was a terribly narrow 
shave, so to speak. You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for 
then you were half in the wraith- world yourself, and they might have seized 
you. You could see them, and they could see you.’ 

'I know,' said Frodo. 'They were terrible to behold! But why could we 




all see their horses?' 

'Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes 
that they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings 
with the living.' 

'Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other animals 
are terrified when they draw near, even the elf-horse of Glorfindel. The 
dogs howl and the geese scream at them.’ 

'Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord 
in Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! There are ores and 
trolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and there have been and still are 
many Men, warriors and kings, that walk alive under the Sun, and yet are 
under his sway. And their number is growing daily.’ 

'What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?’ 

'Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear the 
Dark Lord, and they may fly before him, but never again will they listen to 
him or serve him. And here in Rivendell there live still some of his chief 
foes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas. They 
do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm 
live at once in both worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they 
have great power.' 

'I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim 
like the others. Was that Glorfindel then?' 

'Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the 
mighty of the Firstborn. Lie is an Elf-lord of a house of princes. Indeed 
there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while: 
and elsewhere other powers still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind 
in the Shire. But all such places will soon become islands under siege, if 
things go on as they are going. The Dark Lord is putting forth all his 
strength. 

'Still,' he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin, while 
his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire, 'we must keep up our 
courage. You will soon be well, if I do not talk you to death. You are in 
Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.' 

'I haven't any courage to keep up,' said Frodo, 'but I am not worried 
at the moment. Just give me news of my friends, and tell me the end of the 
affair at the Ford, as I keep on asking, and I shall be content for the 
present. After that I shall have another sleep, I think; but I shan't be 




able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me.' 

Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo. 

The colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully 
awake and aware. He was smiling, and there seemed to be little wrong with 
him. But to the wizard's eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were 
of transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay 
outside upon the coverlet. 

'Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself. 'He is not half 
through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can 
foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a 
clear light for eyes to see that can.' 

'You look splendid,' he said aloud. 'I will risk a brief tale without 
consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again. 
This is what happened, as far as I can gather. The Riders made straight for 
you, as soon as you fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses any 
longer: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold of 
their world. And also the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the 
road, or they would have been ridden down. They knew that nothing could save 
you, if the white horse could not. The Riders were too swift to overtake, 
and too many to oppose. On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could 
not with stand all the Nine at once. 

'When the Ring wraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind. Close to 
the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted 
trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood 
would come down, if the Riders tried to cross, and then he would have to 
deal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the flood 
appeared, he rushed out, followed by Aragorn and the. others with flaming 
brands. Caught between fire and water, and seeing an Elf-lord revealed in 
his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with madness. 
Three were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were 
now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.' 

'And is that the end of the Black Riders?' asked Frodo. 

'No,' said Gandalf. 'Their horses must have perished, and without them 
they are crippled. But the Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily 
destroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. Your 
friends crossed after the flood had passed; and they found you lying on your 
face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under you. The horse was 




standing guard beside you. You were pale and cold, and they feared that you 
were dead, or worse. Elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards 
Ri vendell. ' 

'Who made the flood?' asked Frodo. 

'Elrond commanded it,' answered Gandalf. 'The river of this valley is 
under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the 
Ford. As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the 
flood was released. If I may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you 
may not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white 
horses with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding 
boulders. For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a 
wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away. There is 
great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty 
Mountains.' 

'Yes, it all comes back to me now,’ said Frodo: 'the tremendous 
roaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends and enemies and all. But 
now we are safe!' 

Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes. 'Yes, you 
are all safe for the present. Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to 
celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen, and you will all be there in 
places of honour.' 

'Splendid!' said Frodo. 'It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel 
and such great lords, not to mention Strider, should take so much trouble 
and show me so much kindness.’ 

'Well, there are many reasons why they should,’ said Gandalf, smiling. 

'I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are the Ring-bearer. And you 
are the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder.’ 

'Dear Bilbo!’ said Frodo sleepily. 'I wonder where he is. I wish he was 
here and could hear all about it. It would have made him laugh, The cow 
jumped over the Moon! And the poor old troll!’ With that he fell fast 
asleep. 

Frodo was now safe in the Fast Homely House east of the Sea. That house 
was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, 'a perfect house, whether you like food 
or sleep, or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or 
a pleasant mixture of them all'. Merely to be there was a cure for 
weariness, fear, and sadness. 

As the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no 




longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and 
probably for singing and story-telling afterwards. He got out of bed and 
discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had 
been. He found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him 
excellently. Looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner 
reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked remarkably like the 
young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire; 
but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully. 

'Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a 
looking-glass,' he said to his reflection. 'But now for a merry meeting!' 

He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune. 

At that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in. He ran 
to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it gently 
and then he blushed and turned hastily away. 

'Hullo, Sam!’ said Frodo. 

'It's warm!' said Sam. 'Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so 
cold through the long nights. But glory and trumpets!’ he cried, turning 
round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor. ’It's fine to see 
you up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were 
ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.' 

'I am ready,' said Frodo. 'Let's go and look for the rest of the 
party!' 

'I can take you to them, sir,' said Sam. 'It's a big house this, and 
very peculiar. Always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what you'll 
find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, and Elves there! Some like 
kings, terrible and splendid; and some as merry as children. And the music 
and the singing-not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening 
since we got here. But I'm getting to know some of the ways of the place.' 

'I know what you have been doing, Sam,' said Frodo, taking his arm. 
'But you shall be merry tonight, and listen to your heart's content. Come 
on, guide me round the corners!' 

Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a 
high garden above the steep bank of the river. He found his friends sitting 
in a porch on the side of the house looking east. Shadows had fallen in the 
valley below, but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far 
above. The air was warm. The sound of running and falling water was loud, 
and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if 




summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens. 

'Hurray!' cried Pippin, springing up. 'Here is our noble cousin! Make 
way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!' 

'Hush!' said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch. 'Evil 
things do not come into this valley; but all the same we should not name 
them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of 
Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world! We are sitting 
in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.’ 

'Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,’ said Pippin. 

'He thinks I need keeping in order. But it seems impossible, somehow, to 
feel gloomy or depressed in this place. I feel I could sing, if I knew the 
right song for the occasion.’ 

'I feel like singing myself,' laughed Frodo. 'Though at the moment I 
feel more like eating and drinking!’ 

'That will soon be cured,’ said Pippin. 'You have shown your usual 
cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.’ 

'More than meal! A feast!’ said Merry. 'As soon as Gandalf reported 
that you were recovered, the preparations began.’ He had hardly finished 
speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells. 

The hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves for the most 
part, though there were a few guests of other sorts. Elrond, as was his 
custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and 
next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf. 

Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of 
whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, 
Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were 
revealed 

as lords of dignity and power. Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other 
two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad 
shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged 
face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could 
leap suddenly into fire. 

Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his 
face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and 
keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was 
strength. 

The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was 




written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark 
as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his 
eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of 
stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale 
as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of 
Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men. 

In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, 
there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, 
and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that 
she was one of his close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids 
of her dark hair were touched by no frost, her white arms and clear face 
were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, 
grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge 
were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years 
bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted 
with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament 
save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. 

So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, 
daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of L®thien had 
come on earth again; and she was called Undumiel, for she was the Evenstar 
of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother's kin, in Lurien 
beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her 
father's house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon 
errantry: for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North, 
forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the ores. 

Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor 
imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he 
had a seat at Elrond' s table among all these folk so high and fair. Though 
he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several cushions, he felt very 
small, and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed. The feast 
was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire. It was some time 
before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours. 

He looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be allowed to wait 
on his master, but had been told that for this time he was a guest of 
honour. Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper 
end of one of the side-tables close to the dais. He could see no sign of 
Strider. 




Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly 
dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was white, nearly as white as the 
snow-white cloth of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck 
hung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him. 

'Welcome and well met!' said the dwarf, turning towards him. Then he 
actually rose from his seat and bowed. 'Gluin at your service,' he said, and 
bowed still lower. 

'Frodo Baggins at your service and your family's,' said Frodo 
correctly, rising in surprise and scattering his cushions. 'Am I right in 
guessing that you are the Gluin, one of the twelve companions of the great 
Thorin Oaken shield?' 

'Quite right,' answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and 
courteously assisting Frodo back into his seat. 'And I do not ask, for I 
have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our 
friend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.' 

'Thank you very much,’ said Frodo. 

'You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,' said Gluin. 'I 
wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey. Nothing like 
it has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire 
too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?' 

'I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,' said Frodo 
politely. 

He guessed that even in Elrond's house the matter of the Ring was not 
one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a 
time. 'But I am equally curious,' he added, 'to learn what brings so 
important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.' 

Gluin looked at him. 'If you have not heard, I think we will not speak 
yet of that either. Master Elrond will summon us all ere long, I believe, 
and then we shall all hear many things. But there is much else that may be 
told.' 

Throughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo 
listened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart from the Ring, 
seemed small and far-away and unimportant, while Gluin had much to tell of 
events in the northern regions of Wilderland. Frodo learned that Grimbeorn 
the Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men, and to their 
land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither ore nor wolf dared to go. 

'Indeed,' said Gluin, 'if it were not for the Beornings, the passage 




from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible. They are 
valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock. But their 
tolls are high,' he added with a shake of his head; 'and like Beorn of old 
they are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty, and that is much 
in these days. Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of 
Dale. They are good folk, the Bardings. The grandson of Bard the Bowman 
rules them, Brand son of Bain son of Bard. He is a strong king, and his 
realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth.' 

'And what of your own people?' asked Frodo. 

'There is much to tell, good and bad,' said Gluin; 'yet it is mostly 
good: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not escape the shadow of 
these times. If you really wish to hear of us, I will tell you tidings 
gladly. But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves' tongues run on when 
speaking of their handiwork, they say.' 

And with that Gluin embarked on a long account of the doings of the 
Dwarf-kingdom. He was delighted to have found so polite a listener; for 
Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, 
though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people 
and places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to 
hear that Dbin was still King under the Mountain, and was now old (having 
passed his two hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich. 

Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were 
still with him: Dwalin, Gluin, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur 
was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at 
table, and it took six young dwarves to lift him. 

'And what has become of Balin and Ori and Uin?' asked Frodo. 

A shadow passed over Gluin's face. 'We do not know,' he answered. 'It 
is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those 
that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak of merrier things!' 

Gluin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo 
about their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain. 'We have done 
well,' he said. 'But in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers, many of 
whose, secrets are lost. We make good armour and keen swords, but we cannot 
again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon 
came. Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days. You should 
see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! You 
should see the stone-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and 




cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the 
terraces and towers upon the Mountain’s sides! Then you would see that we 
have not been idle.’ 

'I will come and see them, if ever I can,' said Frodo. 'How surprised 
Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!' 

Gluin looked at Frodo and smiled. 'You were very fond of Bilbo were you 
not?' he asked. 

'Yes,' answered Frodo. 1 would rather see him than all the towers and 
palaces in the world.' 

At length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down 
the hall, and the company followed them in due order. The doors were thrown 
open, and they went across a wide passage and through other doors, and came 
into a further hall. In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in 
a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side. 

Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf. 'This is the Hall of Fire' 
said the wizard. 'Here you will hear many songs and tales-if you can keep 
awake. But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people 
come here who wish for peace, and thought. There is always a fire here, all 
the year round, but there is little other light.' 

As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, elvish 
minstrels began to make sweet music. Slowly the hall filled, and Frodo 
looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together; 
the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair. Suddenly 
he noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure 
seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on the 
ground was a drinking-cup and some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was 
ill 

(if people were ever ill in Ri vendell), and had been unable to come to the 
feast. His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark 
cloak was drawn over his face. 

Elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure. 'Awake little 
master, he said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him. 
'Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,' he said. 
'Here is a friend that you have long missed.' 

The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face. 

'Bilbo!' cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward. 

'Hullo, Frodo my lad!’ said Bilbo. 'So you have got here at last. I 




hoped you would manage it. Well, well! So all this feasting is in your 
honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself?' 

'Why weren't you there?' cried Frodo. 'And why haven't I been allowed 
to see you before?' 

'Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by 
your side with Sam each day. But as for the feast' I don't go in for such 
things much now. And I had something else to do.' 

'What were you doing?’ 

'Why, sitting and thinking. I do a lot of that nowadays, and this is 
the best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!’ he said, cocking an 
eye at Elrond. There was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness 
that Frodo could see. 'Wake up! I was not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want 
to know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, and you have 
disturbed me-in the middle of making up a song. I was stuck over a line or 
two, and was thinking about them; but now I don't suppose I shall ever get 
them right. There will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be 
driven clean out of my head. I shall have to get my friend the D®nadan to 
help me. Where is he?' 

Elrond laughed. 'He shall be found,' he said. 'Then you two shall go 
into a corner and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before 
we end our merrymaking.' Messengers were sent to find Bilbo's friend, though 
none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast. 

In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly 
and placed himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious 
of the mirth and music in the hall about them. Bilbo had not much to say of 
himself. When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the 
Road or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all the 
time towards Ri vendell. 'I got here without much adventure,' he said, 'and 
after a rest I went on with the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan't 
travel again. Old Balin had gone away. Then I came back here, and here I 
have been. I have done this and that. I have written some more of my book. 
And, of course, I make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to 
please me, I think; for, of course, they aren't really good enough for 
Rivendell. And I listen and I think. Time doesn't seem to pass here: it just 
is. A remarkable place altogether. 

'I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out of the 
South, but hardly anything from the Shire. I heard about the Ring, of 




course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a great deal, 
he has become closer than ever these last few years. The D®nadan has told me 
more. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! It is a pity that 
Gandalf did not find out more sooner. I could have brought the thing here 
myself long ago without so much trouble. I have thought several times of 
going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let 
me: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was 
looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught 
me 

tottering about in the Wild. 

'And Gandalf said: "The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do no good 
to you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it again." Odd sort of 
remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after you, so I let 
things be. I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound.' He paused and 
looked at Frodo doubtfully. 

'Have you got it here?' he asked in a whisper. I can't help feeling 
curious, you know, after all I've heard. I should very much like just to 
peep at it again.' 

'Yes, I've got it,' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. 'It 
looks just the same as ever it did.' 

'Well, I should just like to see it for a moment,' said Bilbo. 

When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been 
hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. 
Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring. To his 
distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a 
shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself 
eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. 
He felt a desire to strike him. 

The music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell. 
Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes. 'I 
understand now,' he said. 'Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in 
for this burden: sorry about everything. Don't adventures ever have an end? 

I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can't 
be helped. I wonder if it's any good trying to finish my book? But don't 
let's worry about it now-let's have some real News! Tell me all about the 
Shire!' 

Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred 




of memory. The light and music of Rivendell was about him again. Bilbo 
smiled and laughed happily. Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo 
could tell-aided and corrected now and again by Sam-was of the greatest 
interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the 
smallest child in Hobbiton. They were so deep in the doings of the Four 
Farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green 
cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile. 

Suddenly Bilbo looked up. 'Ah, there you are at last, D®nadan!’ he 
cried. 

'Strider!' said Frodo. 'You seem to have a lot of names.' 

'Well, Strider is one that I haven't heard before, anyway,' said Bilbo. 

'What do you call him that for?’ 

'They call me that in Bree,’ said Strider laughing, 'and that is how I 
was introduced to him.' 

'And why do you call him D®nadan?’ asked Frodo. 

' The D®nadan,' said Bilbo. 'Fie is often called that here. But I thought 
you knew enough Elvish at least to know d®n-udan: Man of the West, 
N®menorean. But this is not the time for lessons!’ He turned to Strider. 

'Where have you been, my friend? Why weren't you at the feast? The Fady 
Arwen was there.' 

Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. 'I know,' he said. 'But often I 
must put mirth aside. Elladan and Elrohir have returned out of the Wild 
unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.' 

'Well, my dear fellow,' said Bilbo, 'now you've heard the news, can't 
you spare me a moment? I want your help in something urgent. Elrond says 
this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening, and I am 
stuck. Fet's go off into a corner and polish it up!' 

Strider smiled. 'Come then!' he said. 'Fet me hear it!’ 

Frodo was left to himself for a while, for Sam had fallen asleep. He 
was alone and felt rather forlorn' although all about him the folk of 
Rivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent, intent upon the 
music of the voices and the instruments, and they gave no heed to anything 
else. Frodo began to listen. 

At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in 
elven-tongues, even though he understood them little' held him in a spell, 
as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took 
shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet 




imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden 
mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the 
enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless 
river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous 
for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air 
about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its 
shining weight into a deep realm of sleep. 

There he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running 
water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo 
chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words. 

Edrendil was a mariner 
that tarried in Arvernien; 
he built a boat of timber felled 
in Nimbrethil to journey in; 
her sails he wove of silver fair, 
of silver were her lanterns made, 
her prow was fashioned like a swan, 
and light upon her banners laid. 

In panoply of ancient kings, 
in chain, d rings he armoured him; 
his shining shield was scored with runes 
to ward all wounds and harm from him; 
his bow was made of dragon-horn, 
his arrows shorn of ebony, 
of silver was his habergeon, 
his scabbard of chalcedony; 
his sword of steel was valiant, 
of adamant his helmet tall, 
an eagle-plume upon his crest, 
upon his breast an emerald. 

Beneath the Moon and under star 
he wandered far from northern strands, 
bewildered on enchanted ways 
beyond the days of mortal lands. 

From gnashing of the Narrow Ice 




where shadow lies on frozen hills, 
from nether heats and burning waste 
he turned in haste, and roving still 
on starless waters far astray 
at last he came to Night of Naught, 
and passed, and never sight he saw 
of shining shore nor light he sought. 

The winds of wrath came driving him, 
and blindly in the foam he fled 
from west to east and errandless, 
unheralded he homeward sped. 

There flying Elwing came to him, 
and flame was in the darkness lit; 
more bright than light of diamond 
the fire upon her carcanet. 

The Silmaril she bound on him 
and crowned him with the living light 
and dauntless then with burning brow 
he turned his prow; and in the night 
from Otherworld beyond the Sea 
there strong and free a storm arose, 
a wind of power in Tarmenel; 
by paths that seldom mortal goes 
his boat it bore with biting breath 
as might of death across the grey 
and long-forsaken seas distressed: 
from east to west he passed away. 

Through Evernight he back was borne 
on black and roaring waves that ran 
o'er leagues unlit and foundered shores 
that drowned before the Days began, 
until he heard on strands of pearl 
when ends the world the music long, 
where ever foaming billows roll 




the yellow gold and jewels wan. 

He saw the Mountain silent rise 
where twilight lies upon the knees 
of Valinor, and Eldamar 
beheld afar beyond the seas. 

A wanderer escaped from night 
to haven white he came at last, 
to Elvenhome the green and fair 
where keen the air, where pale as glass 
beneath the Hill of Ilmarin 
a-glimmer in a valley sheer 
the lamplit towers ofTirion 
are mirrored on the Shadowmere. 

He tarried there from errantry, 
and melodies they taught to him, 
and sages old him marvels told, 
and harps of gold they brought to him. 
They clothed him then in elven-white, 
and seven lights before him sent, 
as through the Calacirian 
to hidden land forlorn he went. 

He came unto the timeless halls 
where shining fall the countless years, 
and endless reigns the Elder King 
in Ilmarin on Mountain sheer; 
and words unheard were spoken then 
of folk of Men and Elven-kin, 
beyond the world were visions showed 
forbid to those that dwell therein. 

A ship then new they built for him 
of mithril and of elven-glass 
with shining prow; no shaven oar 
nor sail she bore on silver mast: 
the Silmaril as lantern light 
and banner bright with living flame 




to gleam thereon by Elbereth 
herself was set, who thither came 
and wings immortal made for him, 
and laid on him undying doom, 
to sail the shoreless skies and come 
behind the Sun and light of Moon. 

From Evereven's lofty hills 
where softly silver fountains fall 
his wings him bore, a wandering light, 
beyond the mighty Mountain Wall. 

From World's End then he turned away 
and yearned again to find afar 
his home through shadows journeying, 
and burning as an island star 
on high above the mists he came, 
a distant flame before the Sun, 
a wonder ere the waking dawn 
where grey the Norland waters run. 

And over Middle-earth he passed 
and heard at last the weeping sore 
of women and of elven-maids 
in Elder Days, in years of yore, 
gut on him mighty doom was laid, 
till Moon should fade, an orb,d star 
to pass, and tarry never more 
on Hither Shores where mortals are; 
for ever still a herald on 
an errand that should never rest 
to bear his shining lamp afar, 
the Flammifer of Westernesse. 

The chanting ceased. Frodo opened his eyes and saw that Bilbo was 
seated on his stool in a circle of listeners, who were smiling and 
applauding. 

'Now we had better have it again,' said an Elf. 

Bilbo got up and bowed. 'I am flattered, Lindir,’ he said. 'But it 




would be too tiring to repeat it all.' 

'Not too tiring for you,' the Elves answered laughing. 'You know you 
are never tired of reciting your own verses. But really we cannot answer 
your question at one hearing!' 

'What!' cried Bilbo. 'You can't tell which parts were mine, and which 
were the D®nadan's?' 

'It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals' said 
the Elf. 

'Nonsense, Lindir,' snorted Bilbo. 'If you can't distinguish between a 
Man and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They're as 
different as peas and apples.' 

'Maybe. To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,' laughed 
Lindir. 'Or to shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other 
business.' 

'I won't argue with you,' said Bilbo. 'I am sleepy after so much music 
and singing. I'll leave you to guess, if you want to.' 

He got up and came towards Frodo. 'Well, that's over,' he said in a low 
voice. 'It went off better than I expected. I don't often get asked for a 
second hearing. What did you think of it?' 

'I am not going to try and guess,' said Frodo smiling. 

'You needn't,’ said Bilbo. 'As a matter of fact it was all mine. Except 
that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone. He seemed to think it 
important. I don't know why. Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing 
rather above my head, and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses 
about Edrendil in the house of Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose he was 
right.' 

'I don't know,' said Frodo. 'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I 
can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on 
from something that I was dreaming about. I didn't understand that it was 
really you speaking until near the end.' 

'It is difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it;' said 
Bilbo. 'Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for 
music and poetry and tales. They seem to like them as much as food, or more. 
They will be going on for a long time yet. What do you say to slipping off 
for some more quiet talk?' 

'Can we?’ said Frodo. 

'Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come and go as you like, 




as long as you don't make a noise.' 

They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the 
doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In 
spite of his delight in Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they 
passed out of the Hall of Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a 
single clear voice rose in song. 

A Elbereth Gilthoniel, 
silivren penna mnriel 
o menel aglar elenath! 

Na-chaered palan-dnriel 
o galadhremmin ennorath, 

Fanuilos, le linnathon 
nef aear, sn nef aearon! 

Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and 
the fire was on his face like summer -light upon the trees. Near him sat the 
Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his 
dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a 
star shone on his breast. They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed 
to Frodo that Arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on 
him from afar and pierced his heart. 

He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song 
fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. ' It is a song to 
Elbereth,' said Bilbo. 'They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed 
Realm, many times tonight. Come on!' 

He led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the gar dens 
and looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen. There they sat for some 
while, looking through the window at the bright stars above the 
steep-climbing woods, and talking softly. They spoke no more of the small 
news of the Shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that 
encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen in the world 
together, of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the 
bright year in the woods. 

At last there came a knock on the door. 'Begging your pardon,’ said 
Sam, putting in his head, 'but I was just wondering if you would be wanting 
anything.' 

'And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,' replied Bilbo. 'I guess you mean that 
it is time your master went to bed.' 




'Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear and he only got 
up today for the first time.' 

'Quite right, Sam,' laughed Bilbo. 'You can trot off and tell Gandalf 
that he has gone to bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, but it has been good 
to see you again! There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good 
talk. I am getting very old, and I began to wonder if I should ever live to 
see your chapters of our story. Good night! I'll take a walk, I think, and 
look at the stars of Elbereth in the garden. Sleep well!' 




Chapter 2 . The Council of Elrond 



Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along 
the terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun 
rise above the far mountains, and shine down. Slanting through the thin 
silver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering, and the woven 
nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying 
nothing, but sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder 
in his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon their 
peaks. 

On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon 
Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk. 'Hullo! Good morning!' said Bilbo. 'Feel 
ready for the great council?’ 

'I feel ready for anything,' answered Frodo. 'But most of all I should 
like to go walking today and explore the valley. I should like to get into 
those pine- woods up there.' He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to 
the north. 

'You may have a chance later,' said Gandalf. 'But we cannot make any 
plans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.' 

Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. 'That is 
the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf. 'Come along now! 
Both you and Bilbo are wanted.' 

Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back 
to the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten, trotted 
Sam. 

Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the 
evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the 
valley. The noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river-bed. 
Birds were singing, and a wholesome peace lay on the land. To Frodo his 
dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world 
outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces 
that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave. 

Elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him. 
Frodo saw Glorfindel and Gluin; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting, 
clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by 




his side, and presented him to the company, saying: 

'Here, my friends is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come 
hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.' 

He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before. 
There was a younger dwarf at Gluin's side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel 
there were several other counsellors of Elrond's household, of whom Erestor 
was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had 
come on an errand from Cnrdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf 
clad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, 
the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a 
tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and 
stern of glance. 

He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed 
though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were 
stained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white 
stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he 
wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He 
gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder. 

'Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, 'is Boromir, a man from the 
South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden 
him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.' 

Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told. 
Much was said of events in the world outside, especially in the South, and 
in the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo had already 
heard many rumours; but the tale of Gluin was new to him, and when the dwarf 
spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour of their 
works of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were 
troubled. 

'It is now many years ago,' said Gluin, 'that a shadow of disquiet fell 
upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to 
be whispered in secret-: it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, 
and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some 
spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own 
tongue Khazad-dym; and they declared that now at last we had the power and 
numbers to return.' 

Gluin sighed. 'Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we 
delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain 




empty since the children of Durin fled. But now we spoke of it again with 
longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of 
Khazad-dym for many lives of kings, save Thrur only, and he perished. At 
last, however, Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and 
though Dbin did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori and Uin and 
many of our folk, and they went away south. 

"That was nigh on thirty years ago. For a while we had news and it 
seemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work 
begun there. Then there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria 
since. 

"Then about a year ago a messenger came to Dbin, but not from 
Moria -from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dbin to his gate. The 
Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would 
give for it, such as he gave of old. And he asked urgently concerning 
hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. "For Sauron knows," 
said he, "that one of these was known to you on a time." 

'At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And then his 
fell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if he could. "As a 
small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this," he said: "that you 
should find this thief," such was his word, "and get from him, willing or 
no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a 
trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. Find it, and 
three rings that the Dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you, 
and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief, 
whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and 
lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse, and things will not seem so well. 

Do you refuse?" 

'At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by 
shuddered, but Dbin said: "I say neither yea nor nay. I must consider this 
message and what it means under its fair cloak." 

' "Consider well, but not too long," said he. 

" "The time of my thought is my own to spend," answered Dbin. 

' "For the present," said he, and rode into the darkness. 

'Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. We 
needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held 
both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power that has 
re-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the 




messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so 
he says, is soon to come, before the ending of the year. 

'And so I have been sent at last by Dbin to warn Bilbo that he is 
sought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this 
least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and 
draws nearer. We discover that messengers have come also to King Brand in 
Dale, and that he is afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is 
gathering on his eastern borders. If we make no answer, the Enemy may move 
Men of his rule to assail King Brand, and Dbin also.' 

'You have done well to come,' said Elrond. 'You will hear today all 
that you need in order to understand the purposes of the Enemy. There is 
naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without it. But 
you do not stand alone. You will learn that your trouble is but part of the 
trouble of all the western world. The Ring ! What shall we do with the Ring, 
the least of rings, the trifle that Sauron fancies? That is the doom that we 
must deem. 

'That is the purpose for which you are called hither. Called, I say. 
though I have not called you to me, strangers from distant lands. You have 
come and are here met, in this very nick of time, by chance as it may seem. 

Yet it is not so. Believe rather that it is so ordered that we, who sit 
here, and none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world. 

'Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden 
from all but a few until this day. And first, so that all may understand 
what is the peril, the Tale of the Ring shall be told from the beginning 
even to this present. And I will begin that tale, though others shall end 
it.' 

Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and 
the Rings of Power, and their forging in the Second Age of the world long 
ago. A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none, 
and many eyes were turned t= Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the 
Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness 
for knowledge, by which Sauron ensnared them. For in that time he was not 
yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft, 
whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly 
in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was 
aware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war, and 
the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut. 




Then through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but since 
that history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond himself set it down in 
his books of lore, it is not here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of 
deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke, the sun rode up 
the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased. 

Of N®menor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the 
Kings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea, borne upon the 
wings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons, Isildur and 
Anbrion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the 
South-realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. But Sauron of Mordor 
assailed them, and they made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and the 
hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor. 

Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed. 'I remember well the 
splendour of their banners,' he said. v It recalled to me the glory of the 
Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and captains 
were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was 
broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not 
so.' 

'You remember?’ said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his 
astonishment. 'But I thought,' he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, 'I 
thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.' 

'So it was indeed,' answered Elrond gravely. 'But my memory reaches 
back even to the Elder Days. Edrendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin 
before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of L®thien 
of Doriath. I have seen three ages in the West of the world, and many 
defeats, and many fruitless victories. 

'I was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the 
Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor, where we had the 
mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aiglos and 
Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of 
Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath 
him; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his 
hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword, and took it for his own.' 

At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. 'So that is what became of the 
Ring!' he cried. 'If ever such a tale was told in the South, it has long 
been forgotten. I have heard of the Great Ring of him that we do not name; 
but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first 




realm. Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.' 

'Alas! yes,' said Elrond. 'Isildur took it, as should not have been. It 
should have been cast then into Orodruin's fire nigh at hand where it was 
made. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone stood by his father in that 
last mortal contest; and by Gil-galad only Cnrdan stood, and I. But Isildur 
would not listen to our counsel. 

’ "This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother," he 
said; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it. But 
soon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named in the North 
Isildur's Bane. Yet death maybe was better than what else might have 
befallen him. 

'Only to the North did these tidings come, and only to a few. Small 
wonder it is that you have not heard them, Boromir. From the ruin of the 
Gladden Fields, where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back over 
the mountains after long wandering. One of these was Ohtar, the esquire of 
Isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to 
Valandil, the heir of Isildur, who being but a child had remained here in 
Rivendell. But Narsil was broken and its light extinguished, and it has not 
yet been forged again. 

'Fruitless did I call the victory of the Fast Alliance? Not wholly so, 
yet it did not achieve its end. Sauron was diminished, but not destroyed. 

His Ring was lost but not unmade. The Dark Tower was broken, but its 
foundations were not removed; for they were made with the power of the Ring, 
and while it remains they will endure. Many Elves and many mighty Men, 
and 

many of their friends, had perished in the war. Anbrion was slain, and 
Isildur was slain; and Gil-galad and Elendil were no more. Never again shall 
there be any such league of Elves and Men; for Men multiply and the 
Firstborn decrease, and the two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that 
day the race of N®menor has decayed, and the span of their years has 
lessened. 

'In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the 
Men of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of Ann®minas beside 
Fake 

Evendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at 
Fornost on the high North Downs, and that now too is desolate. Men call it 
Deadmen's Dike, and they fear to tread there. For the folk of Arnor 




dwindled, and their foes devoured them, and their lordship passed, leaving 
only green mounds in the grassy hills. 

'In the South the realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while its 
splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of N®menor, ere it fell. 
High towers that people built, and strong places, and havens of many ships; 
and the winged crown of the Kings of Men was held in awe by folk of many 
tongues. Their chief city was Osgiliath, Citadel of the Stars, through the 
midst of which the River flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower of the 
Rising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder of the Mountains of Shadow; and 
westward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower of 
the Setting Sun. There in the courts of the King grew a white tree, from the 
seed of that tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters, and the seed 
of that tree before came from Eressla, and before that out of the Uttermost 
West in the Day before days when the world was young. 

'But in the wearing of the swift years of Middle-earth the line of 
Meneldil son of Anbrion failed, and the Tree withered, and the blood of the 
N®menoreans became mingled with that of lesser men. Then the watch upon 
the 

walls of Mordor slept, and dark things crept back to Gorgoroth. And on a 
time evil things came forth, and they took Minas Ithil and abode in it, and 
they made it into a place of dread; and it is called Minas Morgul, the Tower 
of Sorcery. Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith, the Tower of 
Guard; 

and these two cities were ever at war, but Osgiliath which lay between was 
deserted and in its ruins shadows walked. 

'So it has been for many lives of men. But the Lords of Minas Tirith 
still fight on, defying our enemies, keeping the passage of the River from 
Argonath to the Sea. And now that part of the tale that I shall tell is 
drawn to its close. For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of 
all knowledge, and the Three were released from its dominion. But now in 
this latter day they are in peril once more, for to our sorrow the One has 
been found. Others shall speak of its finding, for in that I played small 
part.' 

He ceased, but at once Boromir stood up, tall and proud, before them. 

Give me leave, Master Elrond, said he, first to say more of Gondor; for 
verily from the land of Gondor I am come. And it would be well for all to 
know what passes there. For few, I deem, know of our deeds, and therefore 




guess little of their peril, if we should fail at last. 

'Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of N®menor is spent, 
nor all its pride and dignity forgotten. By our valour the wild folk of the 
East are still restrained, and the terror of Morgul kept at bay; and thus 
alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us, bulwark of 
the West. But if the passages of the River should be won, what then? 

'Yet that hour, maybe, is not now far away. The Nameless Enemy has 
arisen again. Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount 
Doom. 

The power of the Black Land grows and we are hard beset. When the 
Enemy 

returned our folk were driven from Ithilien, our fair domain east of the 
River, though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms. But this very 
year, in the days of June, sudden war came upon us out of Mordor, and we 
were swept away. We were outnumbered, for Mordor has allied itself with the 
Easterlings and the cruel Elaradrim; but it was not by numbers that we were 
defeated. A power was there that we have not felt before. 

'Some said that it could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark 
shadow under the moon. Wherever he came a madness filled our foes, but fear 
fell on our boldest, so that horse and man gave way and fled. Only a remnant 
of our eastern force came back, destroying the last bridge that still stood 
amid the ruins of Osgiliath. 

’I was in the company that held the bridge, until it was cast down 
behind us. Four only were saved by swimming: my brother and myself and 
two 

others. But still we fight on, holding all the west shores of Anduin; and 
those who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much 
praise but little help. Only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we 
call. 

'In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues 
to Elrond: a hundred and ten days I have journeyed all alone. But I do not 
seek allies in war. The might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons, it is 
said. I come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words. For on 
the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled 
sleep; and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again, and once to me. 

’In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a 
growing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered, and out of it I 




heard a voice, remote but clear, crying: 

Seek for the Sword that was broken: 

In Imladris it dwells; 

There shall be counsels taken 
Stronger than Morgul-spells. 

There shall be shown a token 
That Doom is near at hand, 

For Isildur's Bane shall waken, 

And the Halfling forth shall stand. 

Of these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our father, 
Denethor, Lord of Minas Tirith, wise in the lore of Gondor. This only would 
he say, that Imladris was of old the name among the Elves of a far northern 
dale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt, greatest of lore-masters. Therefore 
my brother, seeing how desperate was our need, was eager to heed the dream 
and seek for Imladris; but since the way was full of doubt and danger, I 
took the journey upon myself. Loth was my father to give me leave, and long 
have I wandered by roads forgotten, seeking the house of Elrond, of which 
many had heard, but few knew where it lay.’ 

'And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you' said 
Aragorn, standing up. He cast his sword upon the table that stood before 
Elrond, and the blade was in two pieces. 'Here is the Sword that was 
Broken!' he said. 

'And who are you, and what have you to do with Minas Tirith?’ asked 
Boromir, looking in wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and his 
weather-stained cloak. 

'He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,' said Elrond; 'and he is descended 
through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son of Minas Ithil. He is the 
Chief of the D®nedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.’ 

'Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried Frodo in 
amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded 
at once. 

'It does not belong to either of us,' said Aragorn; 'but it has been 
ordained that you should hold it for a while.' 

'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!' said Gandalf solemnly. 'The time has come. 
Hold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.' 

There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was shaken by 
a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the Ring, 




and a loathing of its touch. He wished he was far away. The Ring gleamed and 
flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand. 

'Behold Isildur's Bane!' said Elrond. 

Boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. 'The Halfling!' 
he muttered. 'Is then the doom of Minas Tirith come at last? But why then 
should we seek a broken sword?’ 

’The words were not the doom of Minas Tirith ,’ said Aragorn. 'But doom 
and great deeds are indeed at hand. For the Sword that was Broken is the 
Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell. It has been treasured 
by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for it was spoken of old 
among us that it should be made again when the Ring, Isildur's Bane, was 
found. Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you 
ask? 

Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?' 

'I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a 
riddle,' answered Boromir proudly. 'Yet we are hard pressed, and the Sword 
of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope-if such a thing could indeed 
return out of the shadows of the past.' He looked again at Aragorn, and 
doubt was in his eyes. 

Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed 
on his friend's behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out: 

All that is gold does not glitter, 

Not all those who wander are lost; 

The old that is strong does not wither, 

Deep roots are not reached by the frost. 

From the ashes a fire shall be woken, 

A light from the shadows shall spring; 

Renewed shall be blade that was broken: 

The crownless again shall be king. 

'Not very good perhaps, but to the point — if you need more beyond the 
word of Elrond. If that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to 
hear, you had best listen to it.' He sat down with a snort. 

'I made that up myself,' he whispered to Frodo, 'for the D®nadan, a 
long time ago when he first told me about himself. I almost wish that my 
adventures were not over, and that I could go with him when his day comes.' 

Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again. 'For my part I 




forgive your doubt,' he said. 'Little do I resemble the figures of Elendil 
and Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of Denethor. 

I am but the heir of Isildur, not Isildur himself. I have had a hard life 
and a long; and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small 
part in the count of my journeys. I have crossed many mountains and many 
rivers, and trodden many plains, even into the far countries of Rhyn and 
Harad where the stars are strange. 

'But my home, such as I have, is in the North. For here the heirs of 
Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many 
generations. Our days have darkened, and we have dwindled; but ever the 
Sword has passed to a new keeper. And this I will say to you, Boromir, ere I 
end. Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters— but hunters ever of 
the servants of the Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor 
only. 

'If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another 
part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do 
not stay. You know little of the lands beyond your bounds. Peace and 
freedom, do you say? The North would have known them little but for us. Fear 
would have destroyed them. But when dark things come from the houseless 
hills, or creep from sunless woods, they fly from us. What roads would any 
dare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands, or in the homes of 
simple men at night, if the D®nedain were asleep, or were all gone into the 
grave? 

'And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, and 
countrymen give us scornful names. "Strider" I am to one fat man who lives 
within a day's march of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little 
town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would not have it 
otherwise. If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be, 
and we must be secret to keep them so. That has been the task of my kindred, 
while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown. 

'But now the world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur's 
Bane is found. Battle is at hand. The Sword shall be reforged. I will come 
to Minas Tirith.' 

'Isildur's Bane is found, you say,' said Boromir. 'I have seen a bright 
ring in the Halfling's hand; but Isildur perished ere this age of the world 
began, they say. How do the Wise know that this ring is his? And how has it 
passed down the years, until it is brought hither by so strange a 




messenger?' 

'That shall be told,' said Elrond. 

'But not yet, I beg, Master!’ said Bilbo. 'Already the Sun is climbing 
to noon, and I feel the need of something to strengthen me.’ 

'I had not named you,’ said Elrond smiling. 'But I do so now. Come! 

Tell us your tale. And if you have not yet cast your story into verse, you 
may tell it in plain words. The briefer, the sooner shall you be refreshed.' 

'Very well,' said Bilbo. 'I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the 
true story, and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise' — he looked 
sidelong at Gluin — l ask them to forget it and forgive me. I only wished 
to claim the treasure as my very own in those days, and to be rid of the 
name of thief that was put on me. But perhaps I understand things a little 
better now. Anyway, this is what happened.' 

To some there Bilbo's tale was wholly new, and they listened with 
amazement while the old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted 
his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. 

He would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the 
Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand. 

'Well told, my friend,' he said, 'but that is enough at this time. For 
the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir. Let 
him now speak!' 

Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his dealings with 
the Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping. Every step of his 
journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered, 
and everything that he could recall concerning the Black Riders was 
examined. At last he sat down again. 

'Not bad,' Bilbo said to him. 'You would have made a good story of it, 
if they hadn't kept on interrupting. I tried to make a few notes, but we 
shall have to go over it all again together some time, if I am to write it 
up. There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!' 

'Yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered Frodo. 'But the story still 
does not seem complete to me. I still want to know a good deal, especially 
about Gandalf.' 

Galdor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. 'You speak for me 
also,’ he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: 'The Wise may have good 
reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the Great Ring of long 
debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less. But may we not 




hear the proofs? And I would ask this also. What of Saruman? He is learned 
in the lore of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he 
knows the things that we have heard?' 

'The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond. 

I had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it 
is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is 
the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.' 

'Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, 'would think the tidings of Gluin, and 
the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of 
great worth to the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then? The Nine the Nazgyl 
keep. The Seven are taken or destroyed.' At this Gluin stirred, but did not 
speak. 'The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much? 

'There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River and the 
Mountain, between the loss and the finding. But the gap in the knowledge of 
the Wise has been filled at last. Yet too slowly. For the Enemy has been 
close behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this 
year, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth. 

'Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the 
doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, and secretly explored his ways, and 
found thus that our fears were true: he was none other than Sauron, our 
Enemy of old, at length taking shape and power again. Some, too, will 
remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and 
for 

long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, 
and the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood 
and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance, 
if chance it was. 

'But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us, 
and had long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through 
Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all was ready. Then he 
gave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the 
Dark Tower and openly declared himself. Then for the last time the Council 
met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One. 
We feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of. But 
Saruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that the One 
would never again be found in Middle-earth. 

"At the worst," said he, "our Enemy knows that we have it not and 




that it still is lost. But what was lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear 
not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into 
Anduin the Great it fell; and long ago, while Sauron slept, it was rolled 
down the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End.'" 

Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of 
the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long 
lain hidden. He sighed. 

'There I was at fault,' he said. 'I was lulled by the words of Saruman 
the Wise; but I should have sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would 
now be less.’ 

'We were all at fault,’ said Elrond, 'and but for your vigilance the 
Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!’ 

'From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,' 
said Gandalf, 'and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how 
long he had possessed it. So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would 
ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but 
he escaped and was not found. And then alas ! I let the matter rest, watching 
and waiting only, as we have too often done. 

'Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to 
sudden fear. Whence came the hobbit's ring? What, if my fear was true, 
should be done with it? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet of my 
dread to none, knowing the peril of an untimely whisper, if it went astray. 

In all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest 
foe. 

'That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware that spies of many 
sorts, even beasts and birds, were gathered round the Shire, and my fear 
grew. I called for the help of the D®nedain, and their watch was doubled; 
and I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.' 

'And I,' said Aragorn, 'counselled that we should hunt for Gollum. too 
late though it may seem. And since it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should 
labour to repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and 
hopeless search.' 

Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, 
down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor. 'There we 
had 

rumour of him, and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but 
we never found him, and at last I despaired. And then in my despair I 




thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded. The 
ring itself might tell if it were the One. The memory of words at the 
Council came back to me: words of Saruman, half-heeded at the time. I heard 
them now clearly in my heart. 

' "The Nine, the Seven, and the Three," he said, "had each their proper 
gem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as it were one of the 
lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could 
still see and read." 

'What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The 
maker. 

And Saruman? But great though his lore may be, it must have a source. What 
hand save Sauron’s ever held this thing, ere it was lost? The hand of 
Isildur alone. 

'With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to Gondor. 

In former days the members of my order had been well received there, but 
Saruman most of all. Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of 
the City. Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and 
grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books. 

’ "If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, 
and the beginnings of the City, read on! " he said. "For to me what was is 
less dark than what is to come, and that is my care. But unless you have 
more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find 
naught that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this 
City." 

'So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that 
few now can read, even of the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues 
have become dark to later men. And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith 
still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings 
failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away 
straight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.’ 

'Some in the North, maybe,' Boromir broke in. 'All know in Gondor that 
he went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil, 
instructing him, before he committed to him the rule of the South Kingdom. 
In that time he planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in memory 
of his brother.' 

'But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf; 'and that is 
not remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For this scroll concerns the Ring, 




and thus wrote Isildur therein: 

The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but 
records of it shall be left in Gondor, where also dwell the heirs of 
Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow 
dim. 

'And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it. 

It was hot when I first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was 
scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it. 

Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth 
neither its beauty nor its shape. Already the writing upon it, which at 
first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read. 

It is fashioned in an elven-script of Eregion, for they have no letters in 
Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I deem it to 
be a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it 
saith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond 
recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, the heat of Sauron's hand, which was black 
and yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the 
gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed, gut for my part I will 
risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It is 
precious to me, though I buy it with great pain. 

’When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced writing 
was indeed as Isildur guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and the servants of 
the Tower. And what was said therein was already known. For in the day that 
Sauron first put on the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the Three, was aware of 
him, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes 
were revealed. 

'At once I took my leave of Denethor, but even as I went northwards, 
messages came to me out of Lurien that Aragorn had passed that way, and that 
he had found the creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first to meet him 
and hear his tale. Into what deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not 
guess.’ 

'There is little need to tell of them,’ said Aragorn. 'If a man must 
needs walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul 
Vale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at last, and I began my 
homeward journey. And then, by fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought: 
the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and 
swift, and it led not to Mordor but away. Along the skirts of the Dead 




Marshes I followed it, and then I had him. Lurking by a stagnant mere, 
peering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was 
covered with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and 
I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks 
of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back, 
watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his 
neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever 
towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for 
we had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his 
company, for he stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but 
Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.’ 

'Yes, long and weary,' said Gandalf, 'but not without profit. For one 
thing, the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now 
told openly for the first time; but that mattered little, since I had 
already guessed it. But I learned then first that Gollum's ring came out of 
the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also that he had 
possessed it long. Many lives of his small kind. The power of the ring had 
lengthened his years far beyond their span; but that power only the Great 
Rings wield. 

'And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other test that 
I spoke of. Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft, round 
and unadorned, the letters that Isildur reported may still be read, if one 
has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I 
have done, and this I have read: 

Ash nazg durbatulyk, ush nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulyk agh 
burzum-ishi krimpatul. ' 

The change in the wizard's voice was astounding. Suddenly it became 
menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high 
sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the Elves 
stopped their ears. 

'Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in 
Imladris, Gandalf the Grey,’ said Elrond, as the shadow passed and the 
company breathed once more. 

'And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,' answered 
Gandalf. 'Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For if that 
tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West, then let all put 
doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the Wise have declared: the 




treasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice; and in it lies a great 
part of his strength of old. Out of the Black Years come the words that the 
Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been betrayed: 

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring 
them all and in the Darkness bind them. 

'Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He was 
loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt that he 
went to Mordor, and there all that he knew was forced from him. Thus the 
Enemy knows now that the One is found, that it was long in the Shire; and 
since his servants have pursued it almost to our door, he soon will know, 
already he may know, even as I speak, that we have it here.' 

All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. 'He is a 
small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What became 
of him? To what doom did you put him?’ 

'He is in prison, but no worse,' said Aragorn. 'He had suffered much. 

There is no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear of Sauron lies black 
on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful 
Elves of Mirkwood. His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be 
believed in one so lean and withered. He could work much mischief still, if 
he were free. And I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some 
evil errand.' 

'Alas! alas!’ cried Legolas, and in his fair elvish face there was 
great distress. 'The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told. They 
are not good, but only here have I learned how evil they may seem to this 
company. Smjagol, who is now called Gollum, has escaped.’ 

'Escaped?' cried Aragorn. 'That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it 
bitterly, I fear. How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in their trust?' 

'Not through lack of watchfulness,' said Legolas; 'but perhaps through 
over -kindliness. And we fear that the prisoner had aid from others, and that 
more is known of our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day 
and night, at Gandalf s bidding, much though we wearied of the task. But 
Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep 
him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old 
black thoughts.' 

'You were less tender to me,' said Gluin with a flash of his eyes as 
old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep places of the 
Elven-king's halls. 




'Now come!' said Gandalf. 'Pray do not interrupt, my good Gluin. That 
was a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If all the grievances 
that stand between Elves and Dwarves are to be brought up here, we may as 
well abandon this Council.' 

Gluin rose and bowed, and Legolas continued. 'In the days of fair 
weather we led Gollum through the woods; and there was a high tree standing 
alone far from the others which he liked to climb. Often we let him mount up 
to the highest branches, until he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at 
the tree's foot. One day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind 
to climb after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his 
feet as well as with his hands; so they sat by the tree far into the night. 

'It was that very night of summer, yet moonless and starless, that Ores 
came on us at unawares. We drove them off after some time; they were many 
and fierce, but they came from over the mountains, and were unused to the 
woods. When the battle was over, we found that Gollum was gone, and his 
guards were slain or taken. It then seemed plain to us that the attack had 
been made for his rescue, and that he knew of it beforehand. How that was 
contrived we cannot guess; but Gollum is cunning, and the spies of the Enemy 
are many. The dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragon's 
fall have returned in greater numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil place, 
save where our realm is maintained. 

'We have failed to recapture Gollum. We came on his trail among those 
of many Ores, and it plunged deep into the Forest, going south. But ere long 
it escaped our skill, and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were 
drawing nigh to Dol Guldur, and that is still a very evil place; we do not 
go that way.’ 

'Well, well, he is gone,' said Gandalf. 'We have no time to seek for 
him again. He must do what he will. But he may play a part yet that neither 
he nor Sauron have foreseen. 

'And now I will answer Galdor's other questions. What of Saruman? What 
are his counsels to us in this need? This tale I must tell in full, for only 
Elrond has heard it yet, and that in brief, but it will bear on all that we 
must resolve. It is the last chapter in the Tale of the Ring, so far as it 
has yet gone. 

'At the end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was on 
my mind, and I rode to the southern borders of the little land; for I had a 
foreboding of some danger, still hidden from me but drawing near. There 




messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor, and when I heard 
of the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing save a few 
fugitives from the South; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of 
which they would not speak. I turned then east and north and journeyed along 
the Greenway; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting on a 
bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. It was Radagast the 
Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near the borders of Mirkwood. 

He 

is one of my order, but I had not seen him for many a year. 

' "Gandalf ! " he cried. "I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in 
these parts. All I knew was that you might be found in a wild region with 
the uncouth name of Shire." 

' "Your information was correct," I said. "But do not put it that way, 
if you meet any of the inhabitants. You are near the borders of the Shire 
now. And what do you want with me? It must be pressing. You were never a 
traveller, unless driven by great need." 

' "I have an urgent errand," he said. "My news is evil." Then he looked 
about him, as if the hedges might have ears. "Nazgyl," he whispered. "The 
Nine are abroad again. They have crossed the River secretly and are moving 
westward. They have taken the guise of riders in black." 

'I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it. 

" "The enemy must have some great need or purpose," said Radagast; "but 
what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts, I cannot 
guess." 

v "What do you mean? " said I. 

v "I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news of a 
land called Shire." 

' "The Shire," I said; but my heart sank. For even the Wise might fear 
to withstand the Nine, when they are gathered together under their fell 
chieftain. A great king and sorcerer he was of old, and now he wields a 
deadly fear. "Who told you, and who sent you? " I asked. 

' "Saruman the White," answered Radagast. "And he told me to say that 
if you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it 
will be too late." 

'And that message brought me hope. For Saruman the White is the 
greatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a worthy Wizard, a master of 
shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and 




birds are especially his friends. But Saruman has long studied the arts of 
the Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was 
by the devices of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be 
that he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine. 

' "I will go to Saruman," I said. 

' "Then you must go now," said Radagast; "for I have wasted time in 
looking for you, and the days are running short. I was told to find you 
before Midsummer, and that is now here. Even if you set out from this spot, 
you will hardly reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek. 

I myself shall turn back at once." And with that he mounted and would have 
ridden straight off. 

' "Stay a moment! " I said. "We shall need your help, and the help of 
all things that will give it. Send out messages to all the beasts and birds 
that are your friends. Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on 
this matter to Saruman and Gandalf. Let messages be sent to Orthanc." 

"I will do that," he said, and rode off as if the Nine were after 

him. 

'I could not follow him then and there. I had ridden very far already 
that day, and I was as weary as my horse; and I needed to consider matters. 

I stayed the night in Bree, and decided that I had no time to return to the 
Shire. Never did I make a greater mistake! 

'However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend the 
innkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn; and I came at long last to 
the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard, in the end of the 
Misty Mountains, not far from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell you 
that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the 
northmost foothills of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But 
Isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall, 
and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc. It was 
not made by Saruman, but by the Men of N®menor long ago; and it is very tall 
and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. It cannot be 
reached save by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle there is 
only one gate. 

'Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of 
rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the keepers of the gate were on the 
watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and 
the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew 




no reason for it. 

'But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of Saruman 
and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber. He wore a ring on his 
finger. 

"So you have come, Gandalf," he said to me gravely; but in his eyes 
there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart. 

v "Yes, I have come," I said. "I have come for your aid, Saruman the 
White." And that title seemed to anger him. 

' "Have you indeed, Gandalf the Grey l " he scoffed. "For aid? It has 
seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning 
and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every 
business, whether it belongs to him or not." 

'I looked at him and wondered. "But if I am not deceived," said I, 

"things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength." 

' "That may be so," he said, "but the thought is late in coming to you. 

How long. I wonder, have you concealed from me, the head of the Council, a 
matter of greatest import? What brings you now from your lurking-place in 
the Shire? " 

' "The Nine have come forth again," I answered. "They have crossed the 
River. So Radagast said to me." 

v "Radagast the Brown! " laughed Saruman, and he no longer concealed 
his scorn. "Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool! 
Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him. For you have come, 
and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf 
the Grey, and rest from journeys. For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman 
Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours! " 

'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not 
so, but were woven of all colours, and if he moved they shimmered and 
changed hue so that the eye was bewildered. 

' "I liked white better," I said. 

' "White! " he sneered. "It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be 
dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken." 

' "In which case it is no longer white," said I. "And he that breaks a 
thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom." 

' "You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for 
friends," said he. "I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you, 
but to give you a choice." 




'He drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a 
speech long rehearsed. "The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are 
passing. The Younger Days are beginning. The time of the Elves is over, but 
our time is at hand: the world of Men, which we must rule. But we must have 
power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the 
Wise can see. 

' "And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper! " he said, coming 
near and speaking now in a softer voice. "I said we, for we it may be, if 
you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against it the old allies and 
policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying 
N®menor. This then is one choice before you. before us. We may join with 
that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory 
is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it. As the 
Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the Wise, such as you 
and I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. 

We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring 
maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: 
Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain 
to accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends. 
There need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs, only 
in our means." 

' "Saruman," I said, "I have heard speeches of this kind before, but 
only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant. I 
cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears." 

'He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. "Well, I see 
that this wise course does not commend itself to you," he said. "Not yet? 

Not if some better way can be contrived? " 

'He came and laid his long hand on my arm. "And why not, Gandalf? " he 
whispered. "Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command that, then the 
Power would pass to us. That is in truth why I brought you here. For I have 
many eyes in my service, and I believe that you know where this precious 
thing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what 
is your business there? " As he said this a lust which he could not conceal 
shone suddenly in his eyes. 

' "Saruman," I said, standing away from him, "only one hand at a time 
can wield the One, and you know that well, so do not trouble to say we! But 
I would not give it, nay, I would not give even news of it to you, now that 




I learn your mind. You were head of the Council, but you have unmasked 
yourself at last. Well, the choices are, it seems, to submit to Sauron, or 
to yourself. I will take neither. Have you others to offer? " 

’He was cold now and perilous. "Yes," he said. "I did not expect you to 
show wisdom, even in your own behalf; but I gave you the chance of aiding me 
willingly, and so saving yourself much trouble and pain. The third choice is 
to stay here, until the end." 

' "Until what end? " 

' "Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find means 
to persuade you. Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has 
time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the 
hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey." 

' "That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters," said I. He 
laughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it. 

'They took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc, in the 
place where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars. There is no descent 
save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps, and the valley below seems 
far away. I looked on it and saw that, whereas it had once been green and 
fair, it was now filled with pits and forges. Wolves and ores were housed in 
Isengard, for Saruman was mustering a great force on his own account, in 
rivalry of Sauron and not in his service yet. Over all his works a dark 
smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc. I stood alone on 
an island in the clouds; and I had no chance of escape, and my days were 
bitter. I was pierced with cold, and I had but little room in which to pace 
to and fro, brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North. 

'That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from the words 
of Saruman which might be lies. Long ere I came to Isengard I had heard 
tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for 
my friends in the Shire; but still I had some hope. I hoped that Frodo had 
set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell 
before the deadly pursuit began. And both my fear and my hope proved 
ill-founded. For my hope was founded on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was 
founded on the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls 
to answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in 
the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the 
hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far 
away.’ 




'I saw you!' cried Frodo. 'You were walking backwards and forwards. The 
moon shone in your hair.' 

Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. 'It was only a dream' said 
Frodo, 'but it suddenly came back to me. I had quite forgotten it. It came 
some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.' 

'Then it was late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see. I was in 
an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in 
such need, and do not bear such misfortune well. Gandalf the Grey caught 
like a fly in a spider's treacherous web! Yet even the most subtle spiders 
may leave a weak thread. 

'At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Radagast had 
also fallen. Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in 
his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I 
should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed his 
mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case to 
try and win over the honest Radagast to treachery. He sought me in good 
faith, and so persuaded me. 

'That was the undoing of Saruman's plot. For Radagast knew no reason 
why he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards Mirkwood where 
he 

had many friends of old. And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide, 
and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Ores; 
and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard 
news of the escape of Gollum. And they sent a messenger to bring these 
tidings to me. 

'So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and 
Gwaihir the Windlord, swiftest of the Great Eagles, came unlooked-for to 
Orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle. Then I spoke to him and 
he bore me away, before Saruman was aware. I was far from Isengard, ere the 
wolves and ores issued from the gate to pursue me. 

' "How far can you bear me? " I said to Gwaihir. 

' "Many leagues," said he, "but not to the ends of the earth. I was 
sent to bear tidings not burdens." 

' "Then I must have a steed on land," I said, "and a steed surpassingly 
swift, for I have never had such need of haste before." 

' "Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord of Rohan sits in his 
halls," he said; "for that is not very far off." And I was glad, for in the 




Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell, and there are no 
horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the Misty 
Mountains and the White. 

' "Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted, do you think? " I said to 
Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith. 

' "They pay a tribute of horses," he answered, "and send many yearly to 
Mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke. But if 
Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long 
delayed." 

'He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn; and now I have 
lengthened my tale over long. The rest must be more brief. In Rohan I found 
evil already at work: the lies of Saruman; and the king of the land would 
not listen to my warnings. He bade me take a horse and be gone; and I chose 
one much to my liking, but little to his. I took the best horse in his land, 
and I have never seen the like of him.’ 

’Then he must be a noble beast indeed,’ said Aragorn; 'and it grieves 
me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that Sauron levies 
such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that land.’ 

'Nor is it now, I will swear,’ said Boromir. 'It is a lie that comes 
from the Enemy. I know the Men of Rohan; true and valiant, our allies, 
dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.’ 

'The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands,’ answered Aragorn. 
’Saruman has fallen under it. Rohan is beset. Who knows what you will find 
there, if ever you return?’ 

'Not this at least.’ said Boromir, ’that they will buy their lives with 
horses. They love their horses next to their kin. And not without reason, 
for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North, far from 
the Shadow, and their race, as that of their masters, is descended from the 
free days of old.’ 

’True indeed!’ said Gandalf. 'And there is one among them that might 
have been foaled in the morning of the world. The horses of the Nine cannot 
vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind. Shadowfax they called 
him. By day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade, 
and he passes unseen. Light is his footfall! Never before had any man 
mounted him, but I took him and I tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that 
I reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrow-downs, though I set out 
from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton. 




'But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of 
the Riders, and though I gained on them day by day, they were ever before 
me. They had divided their forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern 
borders, not far from the Greenway. and some invaded the Shire from the 
south. I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old 
Gamgee. Many words and few to the point. He had much to say about the 
shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End. 

' "I can't abide changes," said he, "not at my time of life, and least 
of all changes for the worst." "Changes for the worst," he repeated many 
times. 

' "Worst is a bad word," I said to him, "and I hope you do not live to 
see it." But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton 
less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the 
same evening. Then I rode on in fear. I came to Buckland and found it in 
uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came 
to the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the 
threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo's. Then for a while hope 
left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted; 
but I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went 
many ways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two had 
ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might 
be said to the innkeeper. 

' "Butterbur they call him," thought I. "If this delay was his fault, I 
will melt all the butter in him. I will roast the old fool over a slow 
fire." He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and 
began to melt on the spot.' 

'What did you do to him?' cried Frodo in alarm. 'He was really very 
kind to us and did all that he could.' 

Gandalf laughed. 'Don't be afraid!' he said. 'I did not bite, and I 
barked very little. So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of him, 
when he stopped quaking, that I embraced the old fellow. How it happened I 
could not then guess, but I learned that you had been in Bree the night 
before, and had gone off that morning with Strider. 

' "Strider! " I cried, shouting for joy. 

"Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir," said Butterbur, mistaking me. "He 
got at them, in spite of all that I could do, and they took up with him. 

They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say." 




"Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman! " said I. "It's the 
best news I have had since midsummer: it's worth a gold piece at the least. 
May your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for 
seven years! " said I. "Now I can take a night's rest, the first since I 
have forgotten when." 

'Sol stayed there that night, wondering much what had become of the 
Riders; for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree, it seemed. But 
in the night we heard more. Five at least came from the west, and they threw 
down the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind; and the 
Bree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world. I got up 
before dawn and went after them. 

'I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened. 

Their Captain remained in secret away south of Bree, while two rode ahead 
through the village, and four more invaded the Shire. But when these were 
foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow, they returned to their Captain with 
tidings, and so left the Road unguarded for a while, except by their spies. 

The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, and he himself 
with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath. 

'I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown 
on my second day from Bree-and they were there before me. They drew 
away 

from me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it 
while the Sun was in the sky. But they closed round at night, and I was 
besieged on the hill -top, in the old ring of Amon Syl. I was hard put to it 
indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the 
war-beacons of old. 

'At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope to 
do more. It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness, and it 
would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels. Sol had to 
trust to Aragorn. But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach 
Rivendell ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, 
but they turned back after a while and made for the Ford, it seems. That 
helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was 
attacked. 

’I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the Floarwell and 
through the Ettenmoors, and down from the north. It took me nearly fourteen 
days from Weathertop, for I could not ride among the rocks of the 




troll-fells, and Shadowfax departed. I sent him back to his master; but a 
great friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my 
call. But so it was that I came to Rivendell only three days before the 
Ring, and news of its peril had already been brought here-which proved well 
indeed. 

'And that, Frodo, is the end of my account. May Elrond and the others 
forgive the length of it. But such a thing has not happened before, that 
Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised. An account to the 
Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think. 

'Well, the Tale is now told, from first to last. Here we all are, and 
here is the Ring. But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose. What 
shall we do with it?' 

There was silence. At last Elrond spoke again. 

'This is grievous news concerning Saruman,' he said; 'for we trusted 
him and he is deep in all our counsels. It is perilous to study too deeply 
the arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill. But such falls and betrayals, 
alas, have happened before. Of the tales that we have heard this day the 
tale of Frodo was most strange to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo 
here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I 
had thought him. The world has changed much since I last was on the 
westward 
roads. 

'The Barrow- wights we know by many names; and of the Old Forest 
many 

tales have been told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern 
march. Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now 
the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and 
many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed 
this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even 
then was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we 
called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he has since been 
given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other 
names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned 
him 

to our Council.' 

'He would not have come,' said Gandalf. 

'Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?’ asked 




Erestor. 'It seems that he has a power even over the Ring.' 

'No, I should not put it so,’ said Gandalf. 'Say rather that the Ring 
has no power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter the Ring 
itself, nor break its power over others. And now he is withdrawn into a 
little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, 
waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them.' 

'But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,' said Erestor. 
'Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?’ 

'No,’ said Gandalf, 'not willingly. He might do so, if all the free 
folk of the world begged him, but he would not understand the need. And if 
he were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it 
away. Such things have no hold on his mind. He would be a most unsafe 
guardian; and that alone is answer enough.’ 

'But in any case,’ said Glorfindel, 'to send the Ring to him would only 
postpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could not now take it back to 
him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the 
Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his 
power towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. 

I think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last 
as he was First; and then Night will come.’ 

'I know little of Iarwain save the name,’ said Galdor; 'but Glorfindel, 

I think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power 
is in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy 
the very hills. What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or 
with Cirdan at the Havens, or in Lurien. But have they the strength, have we 
here the strength to withstand the Enemy, the coming of Sauron at the last, 
when all else is overthrown?’ 

'I have not the strength,’ said Elrond; 'neither have they.’ 

'Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength’ said 
Glorfindel, 'two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the 
Sea, or to destroy it.’ 

'But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft 
that we here possess,’ said Elrond. 'And they who dwell beyond the Sea would 
not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who 
still dwell here to deal with it.’ 

’Then, said Glorfindel, ’let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the 
lies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that even at the Council his 




feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the Ring was not lost for 
ever, but wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself. 

Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.' 

'Not safe for ever,' said Gandalf. 'There are many things in the deep 
waters; and seas and lands may change. And it is not our part here to take 
thought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men, or for a passing age 
of the world. We should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not 
hope to make one.’ 

'And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,' said Galdor. 'If 
the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight to the S,a is 
now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us 
to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The 
Nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite, ere they find new 
steeds and swifter. Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him 
and a march in power along the coasts into the North; and if he comes, 
assailing the White Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves may have no 
escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth.' 

'Long yet will that march be delayed,' said Boromir. 'Gondor wanes, you 
say. But Gondor stands, and even the end of its strength is still very 
strong.' 

'And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,' said Galdor. 

'And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.' 

'Then,' said Erestor, 'there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already 
has declared: to hide the Ring for ever; or to unmake it. But both are 
beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?’ 

'None here can do so,' said Elrond gravely. 'At least none can foretell 
what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now 
clear which is the road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest. 
Therefore it must be shunned. It will be watched. Too often the Elves have 
fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. 
There lies our hope, if hope it be. To walk into peril-to Mordor. We must 
send the Ring to the Fire.’ 

Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a 
sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in 
his heart. Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He was fingering his 
great horn and frowning. At length he spoke. 

’I do not understand all this,' he said. 'Saruman is a traitor, but did 




he not have a glimpse of wisdom? Why do you speak ever of hiding and 
destroying? Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our 
hands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of 
the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem. 

The Men of Gondor are valiant, and they will never submit; but they 
may be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the 
Ring be your weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth 
to victory!' 

’Alas, no,’ said Elrond. ’We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now 
know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone, and is 
altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at 
will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for 
them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the 
heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow 
the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on 
Sauron’s throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another 
reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it 
will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning. 
Even Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will not take 
the Ring to wield it.' 

'Nor I,' said Gandalf. 

Boromir looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. 'So be it,’ 
he said. 'Then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have. And at 
the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight on. Mayhap the 
Sword-that-was-Broken may still stem the tide — if the hand that wields it 
has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.’ 

'Who can tell?’ said Aragorn. 'But we will put it to the test one day.’ 

'May the day not be too long delayed,' said Boromir. 'For though I do 
not ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort us to know that others fought 
also with all the means that they have.' 

'Then be comforted,’ said Elrond. 'For there are other powers and 
realms that you know not, and they are hidden from you. Anduin the Great 
flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor.' 

'Still it might be well for all,' said Gluin the Dwarf, 'if all these 
strengths were joined, and the powers of each were used in league. Other 
rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. The 
Seven are lost to us — if Balin has not found the ring of Thrur which was 




the last; naught has been heard of it since Thrur perished in Moria. Indeed 
I may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that Balin 
went away.’ 

'Balin will find no ring in Moria,' said Gandalf. 'Thrur gave it to 
Thrbin his son, but not Thrbin to Thorin. It was taken with torment from 
Thrbin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.' 

'Ah, alas!' cried Gluin. 'When will the day come of our revenge? But 
still there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of the Elves? Very mighty 
Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by 
the Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not 
say?' 

The Elves returned no answer. 'Did you not hear me, Gluin?’ said 
Elrond. 'The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But 
of them it is not permitted to speak. So much only in this' hour of doubt I 
may now say. They are not idle. But they were not made as weapons of war or 
conquest: that is not their power. Those who made them did not desire 
strength or domination or hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and 
healing, to preserve all things unstained. These things the Elves of 
Middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that 
has been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing, 
and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the 
One. It would be better if the Three had never been. That is his purpose.' 

'But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed as you 
counsel?’ asked Gluin. 

'We know not for certain,' answered Elrond sadly. 'Some hope that the 
Three Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then become free, and 
their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought. But 
maybe when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair things will 
fade and be forgotten. That is my belief.' 

'Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance,' said Glorfindel 
'if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be 
taken away for ever.' 

'Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,' said Erestor, 

'and yet we come no nearer. What strength have we for the finding of the 
Fire in which it was made? That is the path of despair. Of folly I would 
say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.' 

'Despair, or folly?' said Gandalf. 'It is not despair, for despair is 




only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom to 
recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as 
folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our 
cloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs 
all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure 
that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into 
his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having 
the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of 
reckoning.' 

'At least for a while,' said Elrond. 'The road must be trod, but it 
will be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon 
it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. 
Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small 
hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.' 

'Very well, very well, Master Elrond!' said Bilbo suddenly. 'Say no 
more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit 
started this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very 
comfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want to know, I am 
just writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: and he lived 
happily ever afterwards to the end of his days. It is a good ending, and 
none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have to alter that: 
it does not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to 
be several more chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful 
nuisance. When ought I to start? 

' Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his 
lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave 
respect. Only Gluin smiled, but his smile came from old memories. 

'Of course, my dear Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. 'If you had really started 
this affair, you might be expected to finish it. But you know well enough 
now that starting is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part 
is played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the word was 
meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. 

But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has 
passed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is 
ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending 
unaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when 
they come back.' 




Bilbo laughed. 'I have never known you give me pleasant advice before.' 
he said. 'As all your unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this 
advice is not bad. Still, I don't suppose I have the strength or luck left 
to deal with the Ring. It has grown, and I have not. But tell me: what do 
you mean by they? 

'The messengers who are sent with the Ring.’ 

'Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this Council 
has to decide, and all that it has to decide. Elves may thrive on speech 
alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I am only an old hobbit, and 
I miss my meal at noon. Can't you think of some names now? Or put it off 
till after dinner?' 

No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced 
at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All the Council sat with 
downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he 
was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and 
vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to 
rest and remain at peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart. 

At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if 
some other will was using his small voice. 

'I will take the Ring,' he said, 'though I do not know the way.' 

Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart 
pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. 'If I understand aright all 
that I have heard,' he said, 'I think that this task is appointed for you, 

Frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will. This is the hour of 
the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers 
and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it? Or, 
if they are wise, why should they expect to know it, until the hour has 
struck? 

'But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another. 

I do not lay it on you. But if you take it freely, I will say that your 
choice is right; and though all the mighty elf-friends of old, Hador, and 
H®rin, and T®rin, and Beren himself were assembled together your seat 
should 

be among them.' 

'But you won't send him off alone surely, Master?' cried Sam, unable to 
contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been 
quietly sitting on the floor. 




'No indeed!' said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. 'You at 
least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, 
even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.' 

Sam sat down, blushing and muttering. 'A nice pickle we have landed 
ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!’ he said, shaking his head. 




Chapter 3 . The Ring Goes South 



Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo's room. 
Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the 
Council, and had been chosen as Frodo's companion. 

'It's most unfair,' said Pippin. 'Instead of throwing him out, and 
clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!' 

'Rewards!' said Frodo. 'I can't imagine a more severe punishment. You 
are not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on this hopeless 
journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done, and I could 
rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.' 

'I don't wonder,' said Merry, 'and I wish you could. But we are envying 
Sam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us 
to be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a long way with you and 
been through some stiff times. We want to go on.' 

'That's what I meant,' said Pippin. 'We hobbits ought to stick 
together, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be 
someone with intelligence in the party.' 

'Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!' said Gandalf, 
looking in through the window, which was near the ground. 'But you are all 
worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing is decided yet.' 

'Nothing decided!’ cried Pippin. ’Then what were you all doing? You 
were shut up for hours.' 

"Talking,' said Bilbo. 'There was a deal of talk, and everyone had an 
eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas's bit of news about Gollum 
caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.' 

'You were wrong,' said Gandalf. 'You were inattentive. I had already 
heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as 
you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not 
surprised.' 

'Well, anyway,' said Bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor 
Frodo and Sam. I was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I 
was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the 
reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?' 

'Yes,' said the wizard. 'Some of the scouts have been sent out already. 




More will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch 
with the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil's folk in Mirkwood. And 
Aragorn 

has gone with Elrond's sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for 
many long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will 
probably make quite along stay here.' 

'Ah!' said Sam gloomily. 'We'll just wait long enough for winter to 
come.' 

'That can't be helped,' said Bilbo. 'It's your fault partly, Frodo my 
lad: insisting on waiting for my birthday. A funny way of honouring it, I 
can't help thinking. Not the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B.s 
into Bag End. But there it is: you can't wait now fill spring; and you can't 
go till the reports come back. 

When winter first begins to bite 
and stones crack in the frosty night, 
when pools are black and trees are bare, 

'tis evil in the Wild to fare. 

But that I am afraid will be just your luck.' 

'I am afraid it will,' said Gandalf. 'We can't start until we have 
found out about the Riders.' 

T thought they were all destroyed in the flood,' said Merry. 

'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf. 'The power of 
their master is in them, and they stand or fall by him. We hope that they 
were all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made for a while less dangerous; but 
we must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your 
troubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to help you; but I will 
whisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in 
the party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.' 

So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the 
window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed. 'I 
only said I think I shall come. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter 
Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which reminds me, 
I want to see Elrond. I must be off.' 

'How long do you think I shall have here?’ said Frodo to Bilbo when 
Gandalf had gone. 

'Oh, I don't know. I can't count days in Rivendell,' said Bilbo. 'But 
quite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping 




me with my book, and making a start on the next? Have you thought of an 
ending?' 

'Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,' said Frodo. 

'Oh, that won't do!' said Bilbo. 'Books ought to have good endings. How 
would this do: and they all settled down and lived together happily ever 
after?' 

'It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo. 

'Ah!' said Sam. 'And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.' 

For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey 
and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of 
Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. The 
future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over 
the present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with 
each good day as it came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word 
and song. 

So the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and 
each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the 
golden light faded to pale silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the 
naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the 
east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all 
the lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as 
the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it 
from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared 
above the trees on the brink of the valley. 

The hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond, and 
November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and December was 
passing, when the scouts began to return. Some had gone north beyond the 
springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and 
with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the 
Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by 
a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed 
the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the 
source of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over the 
Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at 
Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass 
that was called the Dimrill Stair. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, 
were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the 




Silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak 
to any save to Elrond. 

In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the 
Riders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the Misty 
Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of 
Gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far 
up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned 
in the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers 
discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and 
tattered. Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was 
their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North. 

’Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf. 'It 
is rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the 
Ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they 
could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless. 

Tf that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt 
again. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey 
all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail. 

And if we are careful that will be hard to find. But we must delay no 
longer.' 

Elrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo. 'The 
time has come,' he said. 'If the Ring is to set out, it must go soon. But 
those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or 
force. They must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you 
still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?' 

'I do,' said Frodo. 'I will go with Sam.' 

'Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,' said Elrond. 'I 
can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieved I 
do not know. The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains, and 
draws nigh even to the borders of Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is 
dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and 
you 

may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out 
messages, such as I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world; 
but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or 
come no quicker than you yourself. 

'And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will 




or fortune allows. The number must be few, since your hope is in speed and 
secrecy. Had I a host of Elves in armour of the Elder Days, it would avail 
little, save to arouse the power of Mordor. 

'The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be 
set against the Nine Riders that are evil. With you and your faithful 
servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the 
end of his labours. 

'For the rest, they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the 
World: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Legolas shall be for the Elves; and Gimli 
son of Gluin for the Dwarves. They are willing to go at least to the passes 
of the Mountains, and maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son of 
Arathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.' 

'Strider!' said Frodo. 

’Yes,' he said with a smile. 'I ask leave once again to be your 
companion, Frodo.' 

'I would have begged you to come,’ said Frodo, 'only I thought you were 
going to Minas Tirith with Boromir.' 

'I am,' said Aragorn. 'And the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged 
ere I set out to war. But your road and our road lie together for many 
hundreds of miles. Therefore Boromir will also be in the Company. He is a 
valiant man.’ 

’There remain two more to be found,' said Elrond. "These I will 
consider. Of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send.' 

'But that will leave no place for us!' cried Pippin in dismay. 'We 
don't want to be left behind. We want to go with Frodo.' 

'That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies 
ahead,' said Elrond. 

'Neither does Frodo,' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. 

'Nor do any of us see clearly. It is true that if these hobbits understood 
the danger, they would not dare to go. But they would still wish to go, or 
wish that they dared, and be shamed and unhappy. I think, Elrond, that in 
this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to 
great wisdom. Even if you chose for us an elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he 
could not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road to the Fire by the power 
that is in him.' 

'You speak gravely,' said Elrond, 'but I am in doubt. The Shire, I 
forebode, is not free now from peril; and these two I had thought to send 




back there as messengers, to do what they could, according to the fashion of 
their country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that 
the younger of these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart is against 
his going.' 

'Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me 
home tied in a sack,' said Pippin. 'For otherwise I shall follow the 
Company.’ 

'Let it be so then. You shall go,’ said Elrond, and he sighed. 'Now the 
tale of Nine is filled. In seven days the Company must depart.' 

The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade 
was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the 
rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of 
Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was that 
sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, 
and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And 
Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And®ril, Flame of the West. 

Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and 
the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps 
and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with 
them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much 
time as he could with Bilbo. 

In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall 
of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren 
and L®thien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry 
and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in 
his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which 
still seemed very incomplete), or scraps of his verses, or would take notes 
of Frodo's adventures. 

On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo, and the old 
hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. He lifted the lid and 
fumbled inside. 

'Here is your sword,' he said. 'But it was broken, you know. I took it 
to keep it safe but I've forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it. No 
time now.. So I thought, perhaps, you would care to have this, don't you 
know?' 

He took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. 
Then he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly, 




cold and bright. This is Sting,' he said, and thrust it with little effort 
deep into a wooden beam. 'Take it, if you like. I shan’t want it again, I 
expect.' 

Frodo accepted it gratefully. 

'Also there is this!' said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to 
be rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds of old cloth, and 
held up a small shirt of mail. It was close-woven of many rings, as supple 
almost as linen, cold as ice, and harder than steel. It shone like moonlit 
silver, and was studded with white gems. With it was a belt of pearl and 
crystal. 

'It's a pretty thing, isn't it?' said Bilbo, moving it in the light. 

'And useful. It is my dwarf-mail that Thorin gave me. I got it back from 
Michel Delving before I started, and packed it with my luggage: I brought 
all the mementoes of my Journey away with me, except the Ring. But I did not 
expect to use this, and I don't need it now, except to look at sometimes. 

You hardly feel any weight when you put it on.' 

'I should look — well, I don't think I should look right in it,' said 
Frodo. 

'Just what I said myself,’ said Bilbo. 'But never mind about looks. You 
can wear it under your outer clothes. Come on! You must share this secret 
with me. Don't tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you 
were wearing it. I have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black 
Riders,' he ended in a low voice. 

'Very well, I will take it,' said Frodo. Bilbo put it on him, and 
fastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo put over the top his 
old weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket. 

'Just a plain hobbit you look,' said Bilbo. 'But there is more about 
you now than appears on the surface. Good luck to you!' He turned away and 
looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune. 

'I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, and for all our past 
kindnesses,' said Frodo. 

'Don't try!' said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the 
back. 'Ow!' he cried. 'You are too hard now to slap! But there you are: 
Hobbits must stick together, and especially Bagginses. All I ask in return 
is: take as much care of yourself as you can. and bring back all the news 
you can, and any old songs and tales you can come by. I’ll do my best to 
finish my book before you return. I should like to write the second book, if 




I am spared.' He broke off and turned to the window again, singing softly. 



I sit beside the fire and think 
of all that I have seen, 
of meadow-flowers and butterflies 
in summers that have been; 

Of yellow leaves and gossamer 
in autumns that there were, 
with morning mist and silver sun 
and wind upon my hair. 

I sit beside the fire and think 
of how the world will be 
when winter comes without a spring 
that I shall ever see. 

For still there are so many things 
that I have never seen: 
in every wood in every spring 
there is a different green. 

I sit beside the fire and think 
of people long ago, 
and people who will see a world 
that I shall never know. 

But all the while I sit and think 
of times there were before, 

I listen for returning feet 
and voices at the door. 

It was a cold grey day near the end of December. The East Wind was 
streaming through the bare branches of the trees, and seething in the dark 
pines on the hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low. As 
the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the Company made 
ready to set out. They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to 




journey under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far 
from Ri vendell. 

'You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron,' he said. 'I 
do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached 
him, and he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies on foot and wing 
will be abroad in the northern lands. Even of the sky above you must beware 
as you go on your way.' 

The Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not 
in battle. Aragorn had And®ril but no other weapon, and he went forth clad 
only in rusty green and brown, as a Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a 
long sword, in fashion like And®ril but of less lineage and he bore also a 
shield and his war -horn. 

'Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,' he said, 'and 
then let all the foes of Gondor flee!’ Putting it to his lips he blew a 
blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice 
in Rivendell sprang to their feet. 

Slow should you be to wind that horn again, Boromir, said Elrond. 
'until you stand once more on the borders of your land, and dire need is on 
you.' 

'Maybe,' said Boromir. 'But always I have let my horn cry at setting 
forth, and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows, I will not go forth 
as a thief in the night.' 

Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings, for 
dwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed axe. 
Legolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a long white knife. The 
younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but 
Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. 
Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, 
the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely 
Mountain. 

All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had 
jackets and cloaks lined with fur. Spare food and clothes and blankets and 
other needs were laden on a pony, none other than the poor beast that they 
had brought from Bree. 

?he stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he 
was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth. It was Sam who had 
insisted on choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine, 




if he did not come. 

'That animal can nearly talk,' he said, 'and would talk, if he stayed 
here much longer. He gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it: 
if you don't let me go with you, Sam, I'll follow on my own.' So Bill was 
going as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the Company that 
did not seem depressed. 

Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they 
were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. A 
gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in 
many windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside 
Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully 
what this hour meant to him. The others could be seen as grey shapes in the 
darkness. 

Sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily 
into the gloom where the river roared stonily below; his desire for 
adventure was at its lowest ebb. 

'Bill, my lad,’ he said, 'you oughtn't to have took up with us. You 
could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.' Bill 
swished his tail and said nothing. 

Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his 
mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten 
anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt 
that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of 
pipe- weed (but not near enough, I'll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen 
hose: linen; various small belongings of his master's that Frodo had 
forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were 
called for. He went through them all. 

'Rope!' he muttered. 'No rope! And only last night you said to 
yourself: "Sam, what about a bit of rope? You'll want it, if you haven't got 
it:" Well, I'll want it. I can't get it now.' 

At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company 
to him. 'This is my last word,' he said in a low voice. 'The Ring-bearer is 
setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On him alone is any charge laid: 
neither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy 
nor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the Company and the 
Council, and only then in gravest need. The others go with him as free 
companions, to help him on his way. You may tarry, or come back, or turn 




aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, the less easy 
will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further 
than you will. For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you 
cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road.' 

'Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,' said Gimli. 

'Maybe,' said Elrond, 'but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has 
not seen the nightfall.' 

'Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,' said Gimli. 

'Or break it,' said Elrond. 'Look not too far ahead! But go now with 
good hearts ! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free 
Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!’ 

'Good . . . good luck!' cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold. 'I don't 
suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a 
full account when you get back. And don't be too long! Farewell!' 

Many others of Elrond's household stood in the shadows and watched them 
go, bidding them farewell with soft voices. There was no laughter, and no 
song or music. At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk. 

They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that 
led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high 
moor where the wind hissed through the heather. Then with one glance at the 
Last Flomely Flouse twinkling below them they strode away far into the night. 

At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went 
on by narrow paths among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this 
course west of the Mountains for many miles and days. The country was 
much 

rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in 
Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; 
but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The 
spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the 
paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell. 

Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land 
even in the dark. The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes 
were keen was the rearguard. The first part of their journey was hard and 
dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many sunless 
days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed 
able to keep out its searching fingers. Though the Company was well clad, 
they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during 




the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the 
tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late 
afternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and 
cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. In 
the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could 
find a way. 

At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and 
stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and 
getting nowhere. Each day the land looked much the same as it had the day 
before. Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer. South of Rivendell 
they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main 
range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys 
filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding, and led them often 
only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps. 

They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind 
suddenly fell and then veered round to the south. The swift-flowing clouds 
lifted and melted away, and the sun came out, pale and bright. There came a 
cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march. The travellers 
reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly -trees whose grey-green trunks 
seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills. Their dark 
leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun. 

Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains 
that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking. At the 
left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up 
like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still 
largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed 
red. 

Gandalf stood at Frodo’s side and looked out under his hand. 'We have 
done well,’ he said. 'We have reached the borders of the country that Men 
call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its 
name. Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we have come, though many 
long miles further our feet have walked. The land and the weather will be 
milder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.’ 

'Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,’ said Frodo, 
throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face. 

’But the mountains are ahead of us,’ said Pippin. 'We must have turned 
eastwards in the night.’ 




'No,' said Gandalf. 'But you see further ahead in the clear light. 

Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. There are many maps 
in 

Elrond's house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?' 

'Yes I did, sometimes,' said Pippin, 'but I don't remember them. Frodo 
has a better head for that sort of thing.' 

'I need no map,' said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and was 
gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes. 'There is the 
land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those 
mountains into many works of metal and of stone, and into many songs and 
tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathyr. 

'Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know 
them and their names, for under them lies Khazad-dym, the Dwarrowdelf, that 
is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue. Yonder stands 
Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and 
Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call 
Zirak-zigil and Bundushathyr. 

'There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their arms lies the 
deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale, 
which the Elves call Nanduhirion.' 

'It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,' said Gandalf. 'If we 
climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate, under the far side of 
Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the 
Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises in 
its icy springs.’ 

'Dark is the water of Kheled-zvram,' said Gimli, 'and cold are the 
springs of Kibil-nvla. My heart trembles at the thought that I may see them 
soon.' 

'May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf f said Gandalf. 'But 
whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down 
the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the Great River, and then 

f 

He paused. 

'Yes, and where then?' asked Merry. 

'To the end of the journey — in the end,' said Gandalf. 'We cannot 
look too far ahead. Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over. I 
think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well. There is a 




wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly 
forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there.’ 

That is true,' said Legolas. 'But the Elves of this land were of a 
race strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not 
now remember them: Only I hear the stones lament them: deep they delved us, 
fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone. They are 
gone. They sought the Elavens long ago.' 

That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes 
of holly, and their supper -breakfast was merrier than it had been since they 
set out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all 
the night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again until the 
evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless. After a while 
he left the Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the 
shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with his head posed 
as if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked 
down at the others laughing and talking. 

'What is the matter, Strider?’ Merry called up. ’What are you looking 
for? Do you miss the East Wind?’ 

’No indeed,’ he answered. 'But I miss something. I have been in the 
country of Hollin in many seasons. No folk dwell here now, but many other 
creatures live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things but 
you are silent. I can feel it. There is no sound for miles about us, and 
your voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.’ 

Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. 'But what do you guess is the 
reason?’ he asked. 'Is there more in it than surprise at seeing four 
hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or 
heard?’ 

'I hope that is it,’ answered Aragorn. 'But I have a sense of 
watchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.’ 

"Then we must be more careful,’ said Gandalf. ’If you bring a Ranger 
with you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially if the Ranger is 
Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.’ 

It was Sam’s turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined 
him. The others fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it. 

The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish of the 
pony’s tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam 
could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was around 




him, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East. 
Away in the South a dark patch appeared, and grew, and drove north like 
flying smoke in the wind. 

'What's that, Strider? It don’t look like a cloud,' said Sam in a 
whisper to Aragorn. He made no answer, he was gazing intently at the sky; 
but before long Sam could see for himself what was approaching. Flocks of 
birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all 
the land as if they were searching for something; and they were steadily 
drawing nearer. 

'Lie flat and still!' hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade 
of a holly -bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from 
the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought 
they were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense 
a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one 
harsh croak was heard. 

Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the 
sky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up and went and 
wakened Gandalf. 

'Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the 
Mountains and the Greyflood,' he said, 'and they have passed over Hollin. 
They are not natives here; they are crebain out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do 
not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from 
which they are fleeing; but I think they are spying out the land. I have 
also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move 
again this evening. Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being 
watched.' 

'And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,' said Gandalf; 'and how we 
can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of 
that when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you 
are right.' 

'Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the 
crebain came,' said Aragorn. 'It must be put out and not lit again.' 

'Well if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!' said Pippin. The news: no 
fire, and a move again by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke 
in the late afternoon. 'All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward 
to a real good meal tonight: something hot.' 

'Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf. 'There may be many 




unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in 
comfort, and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate: 
it will get warmer as we get south.' 

'Too warm, I shouldn't wonder,' muttered Sam to Frodo. 'But I'm 
beginning to think it's time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain and saw 
the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that this here Redhorn, 
or whatever its name is, might be it, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair 
jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!' Maps conveyed nothing to Sam's mind, 
and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite 
out of his reckoning. 

All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over 
now and again; but as the westering Sun grew red they disappeared 
southwards. At dusk the Company set out, and turning now half east they 
steered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly 
red in the last light of the vanished Sun. One by one white stars sprang 
forth as the sky faded. 

Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo like the 
remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from 
Hollin to the mountain-pass. The Moon, now at the full, rose over the 
mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black. 
Many of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay 
tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land. 

It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon 
was low. Frodo looked up at the sky. Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass 
over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out 
again. He shivered. 

'Did you see anything pass over?' he whispered to Gandalf, who was just 
ahead. 

'No, but I felt it, whatever it was,' he answered. 'It may be nothing, 
only a wisp of thin cloud.' 

'It was moving fast then,' muttered Aragorn, 'and not with the wind.' 

Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even 
brighter than before. But the air was chill again; already the wind was 
turning back towards the east. For two more nights they marched on, climbing 
steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the 
mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose 
before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer 




naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood. 

There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The wind had 
gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back. 

'Winter deepens behind us,' he said quietly to Aragorn. 'The heights 
away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their 
shoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate. 
We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some 
evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you 
think of your course now, Aragorn?' 

Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn 
were continuing some debate that had begun long before. He listened 
anxiously. 

'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, 
Gandalf,' answered Aragorn. 'And perils known and unknown will grow as we 
go 

on. But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the 
mountains. Further south there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap of 
Rohan. I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows 
which 

side now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?’ 

'Who knows indeed!' said Gandalf. 'But there is another way, and not by 
the pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.’ 

'But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others I 
beg, not until it is plain that there is no other way.' 

'We must decide before we go further,' answered Gandalf. 

'Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and 
sleep,' said Aragorn. 

In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, 

Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its 
sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. Frodo 
watched them, wondering which way the debate would go. When they returned 
to 

the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face 
the weather and the high pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was 
the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill 
Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned. 

'From signs that we have seen lately,’ said Gandalf, ’I fear that the 




Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is 
coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all the speed that we 
can. 

Even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the 
pass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you can 
get ready.' 

'I will add a word of advice, if I may,' said Boromir. 'I was born 
under the shadow of the White Mountains and know something of journeys 
in 

the high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down 
on the other side. It will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen 
to death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes, 
each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.' 

'And Bill could take a bit more, couldn't you lad?' said Sam. The pony 
looked at him mournfully. 

'Very well,' said Gandalf. 'But we must not use the wood — not unless 
it is a choice between fire and death.' 

The Company set out again with good speed at first; but soon their way 
became steep and difficult. The twisting and climbing road had in many 
places almost disappeared, and was blocked with many fallen stones. The 
night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among the 
rocks. By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The 
narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which 
the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right 
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine. 

Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the 
top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim 
white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve. 

They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all 
the air, and swirling into Frodo's eyes. The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and 
Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen. 

'I don't like this at all,' panted Sam just behind. 'Snow's all right 
on a fine morning, but I like to be in bed while it's falling. I wish this 
lot would go off to Hobbiton! Folk might welcome it there.' Except on the 
high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire, and was 
regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save 




Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of 131 1, when the white wolves 
invaded 

the Shire over the frozen Brandywine. 

Gandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was 
already ankle-deep about his boots. 

"This is what I feared,' he said. 'What do you say now, Aragorn?' 

'That I feared it too,' Aragorn answered, 'but less than other things. 

I knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save 
high up in the mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down, 
where the paths are usually open all the winter.' 

'I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy,' said Boromir. "They 
say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that 
stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and many allies.' 

'His arm has grown long indeed,' said Gimli, 'if he can draw snow down 
from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.' 

'His arm has grown long,' said Gandalf. 

While they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened 
until it almost ceased. They tramped on again. But they had not gone more 
than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled 
and the snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard to 
keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller 
folk, but it was plain that they could not go much further, if the snow 
continued. Frodo's feet felt like lead. Pippin was dragging behind. Even 
Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged. 

The Company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement 
without any words being spoken. They heard eerie noises in the darkness 
round them. It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and 
gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and 
wild howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from the mountain-side, 
whistling over their heads, or crashing on the path beside them. Every now 
and again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from 
hidden heights above. 

'We cannot go further tonight,' said Boromir. 'Let those call it the 
wind who will; there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are aimed 
at us.' 

'I do call it the wind,' said Aragorn. 'But that does not make what you 
say untrue. There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have 




little love for those that go on two legs, and yet are not in league with 
Sauron, but have purposes of their own. Some have been in this world longer 
than he.’ 

’Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name, said Gimli, 'long 
years ago, when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.' 

'It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; 
said Gandalf. 

'But what can we do?' cried Pippin miserably. He was leaning on Merry 
and Frodo, and he was shivering. 

'Either stop where we are, or go back,' said Gandalf. ’It is no good 
going on. Only a little higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves the 
cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard 
slope. We should have no shelter there from snow, or stones — or anything 
else.' 

'And it is no good going back while the storm holds,' said Aragorn. 'We 
have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this 
cliff-wall we are under now.' 

'Shelter!' muttered Sam. 'If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof 
make a house.' 

The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. 

It faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that 
they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and 
from the falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every 
side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds. 

They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood 
patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a 
little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went 
on mounting. If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon 
have been entirely buried. 

A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a 
warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the 
shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo's voice speaking. / 
don 't think much of your diary , he said. Snowstorms on January the twelfth: 
there was no need to come back to report that! 

But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo , Frodo answered with an effort, when 
he felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. Boromir 
had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow. 




'This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,' said Boromir. 'It 
is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads. We must do 
something to save ourselves.’ 

'Give them this,’ said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a 
leathern flask. 'Just a mouthful each — for all of us. It is very precious. 

It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting. 

Pass it round!’ 

As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor 
he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs. 

The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow did 
not relent. It whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew 
louder. 

’What do you say to fire?’ asked Boromir suddenly. ’The choice seems 
near now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from 
all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help 
us.’ 

’You may make a fire, if you can,’ answered Gandalf. ’If there are any 
watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.’ But 
though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir, it 
passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid 
the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf 
himself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and 
then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen ! he thrust the end of his 
staff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green and blue flame 
sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered. 

'If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,’ he 
said. ’I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from 
Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.’ 

But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes. Their 
hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily; 
and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under 
their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. There they stood, 
stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames. A red 
light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a 
black wall. 

But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell. 

The fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on. 




The night is getting old,' said Aragorn. "The dawn is not far off.' 

'If any dawn can pierce these clouds,' said Gimli. 

Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness. 

'The snow is growing less,' he said, 'and the wind is quieter.' 

Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be 
revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long 
time he could see no sign of their slackening. Then suddenly, as sleep was 
beginning to creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed 
fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly a dim 
light began to grow. At last the snow stopped altogether. 

As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. Below 
their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which 
the path that they had trodden was altogether lost; but the heights above 
were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow. 

Gimli looked up and shook his head. 'Caradhras has not forgiven us.' he 
said. 'He has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. The sooner we go 
back and down the better.' 

To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well 
prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay 
many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been 
scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff. 

'If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a 
path for you,' said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, and he alone 
of the Company remained still light of heart. 

'If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save 
us,’ answered Gandalf. 'But I must have something to work on. I cannot burn 
snow.’ 

'Well,' said Boromir, 'when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as 
we say in my country. The strongest of us must seek a way. See! Though all 
is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of 
rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us. If we 
could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more 
than a furlong off, I guess.' 

'Then let us force a path thither, you and I!’ said Aragorn. 

Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in 
height, was broader and heavier in build. He led the way, and Aragorn 
followed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In 




places the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to be swimming 
or 

burrowing with his great arms rather than walking. 

Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then 
he turned to the others. 'The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: 
let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running 
light over grass and leaf or over snow-an Elf.' 

With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the 
first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore 
only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the 
snow. 

'Farewell!' he said to Gandalf. 'I go to find the Sun!' Then swift as a 
runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, 
with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and 
vanished round the rocky turn. 

The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragorn 
dwindled into black specks in the whiteness. At length they too passed from 
sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow 
came curling down again. 

An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last 
they saw Legolas coming back. At the same time Boromir and Aragorn 
reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope. 

'Well,' cried Legolas as he ran up, 'I have not brought the Sun. She is 
walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this 
Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam of 
good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest 
wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost 
buried. They despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was 
little wider than a wall. And on the other side the snow suddenly grows 
less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a 
hobbit's toes.' 

'Ah, it is as I said,' growled Gimli. 'It was no ordinary storm. It is 
the ill will of Caradhras. He does not love Elves and Dwarves, and that 
drift was laid to cut off our escape.' 

'But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,' 
said Boromir, who came up at that moment. 'And doughty Men too, if I may 
say 




it; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we 
have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may be grateful 
who cannot run as light as Elves.' 

'But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the 
drift?' said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits. 

'Have hope!' said Boromir. 'I am weary, but I still have some strength 
left, and Aragorn too. We will bear the little folk. The others no doubt 
will make shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will 
begin with you.' 

He lifted up the hobbit. 'Cling to my back! I shall need my arms' he 
said and strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at 
his strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other 
tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the 
track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went. 

They came at length to the great drift. It was flung across the 
mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if 
shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of Boromir; but 
through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a 
bridge. On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down, and there they 
waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive. 

After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the narrow but 
now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among 
the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane; 
but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled 
down a fall of stones and slithering snow. The spray of it half blinded the 
Company as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again 
they saw that the path was blocked behind them. 

'Enough, enough!' cried Gimli. 'We are departing as quickly as we may!' 
And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be 
expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten 
off and would not dare to return. The threat of snow lifted; the clouds 
began to break and the light grew broader. 

As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more 
shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon 
they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope 
where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before. 

The morning was now far advanced. From the high place they looked back 




westwards over the lower lands. Far away in the tumble of country that lay 
at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to 
climb the pass. 

Frodo’s legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head 
was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill. Black specks 
swam before his eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the 
distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were 
circling in the air. 

'The birds again!’ said Aragorn, pointing down. 

That cannot be helped now,’ said Gandalf. 'Whether they are good or 
evil, or have nothing to do with us at all, we must go down at once. Not 
even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!’ 

A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the 
Redhorn Gate, and stumbled wearily down the slope. Caradhras had defeated 
them. 




Chapter 4 . A Journey in the Dark 



It was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they 
halted for the night. They were very weary. The mountains were veiled in 
deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more 
mouthful 

each of the miruvor of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a 
council. 

'We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,' he said. 'The attack on 
the Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.' 

'And then where are we to go? ’ asked Frodo. 

'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf. 

'We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.' 

Pippin's face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to 
Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn and Boromir 
made 

no sign. Frodo looked troubled. 

'I wish I was back there,’ he said. 'But how can I return without shame 
— unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? ’ 

'You are right, Frodo,' said Gandalf: 'to go back is to admit defeat 
and face worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then the Ring must remain 
there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell 
will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. 

The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the 
power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master's 
hand again.' 

'Then we must go on, if there is a way,' said Frodo with a sigh. Sam 
sank back into gloom. 

'There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf. I thought from the 
beginning, when first I considered this journey, that we should try it. But 
it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the Company before. 
Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been 
tried.' 

'If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil 




indeed,' said Merry. 'But you had better tell us about it, and let us know 
the worst at once.' 

'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf. 

Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all 
the others a dread fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it 
was a legend of vague fear: 

'The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will lead 
through Moria? ’ said Aragorn darkly. 

'It is a name of ill omen,' said Boromir. 'Nor do I see the need to go 
there. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we 
come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the 
road that I followed on my way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the 
Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions 
nigh to the sea.’ 

'Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,' answered Gandalf. 
'Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman? With him I may have business 
of my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near Isengard, if that 
can by any means be prevented. The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go 
with the Bearer. 

'As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might spend a 
year in such a journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty 
and harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of 
Saruman and of the Enemy are on them. When you came north, Boromir, you 
were 

in the Enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of 
small concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But 
you return now as a member of the Ring's Company, and you are in peril as 
long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that 
we go south under the naked sky. 

'Since our open attempt on the mountain -pass our plight has become more 
desperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from 
sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go 
neither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them. That is a road 
at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take.’ 

'We do not know what he expects,' said Boromir. 'lie may watch all 
roads, likely and unlikely. In that case to enter Moria would be to walk 
into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower 




itself. The name of Moria is black.' 

'You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the 
stronghold of Sauron,' answered Gandalf. 'I alone of you have ever been in 
the dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in 
Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-dyr do not return. But I would 
not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again. If there 
are Ores there, it may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Ores 
of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five 
Armies. The Eagles report that Ores are gathering again from afar; but there 
is a hope that Moria is still free. 

'There is even a chance that Dwarves are there, and that in some deep 
hall of his fathers, Balin son of Fundin may be found. However it may prove, 
one must tread the path that need chooses!’ 

’I will tread the path with you, Gandalf! ’ said Gimli. ’I will go and 
look on the halls of Durin, whatever may wait there-if you can find the 
doors that are shut.’ 

'Good, Gimli! ' said Gandalf. 'You encourage me. We will seek the 
hidden doors together. And we will come through. In the ruins of the 
Dwarves, a dwarfs head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men or 
Hobbits. Yet it will not be the first time that I have been to Moria. I 
sought there long for Thrbin son of Thrur after he was lost. I passed 
through, and I came out again alive! ’ 

'I too once passed the Dimrill Gate,' said Aragorn quietly; 'but though 
I also came out again, the memory is very evil. I do not wish to enter Moria 
a second time.' 

'And I don't wish to enter it even once,' said Pippin. 

'Nor me,' muttered Sam. 

'Of course not! ' said Gandalf. 'Who would? But the question is: who 
will follow me, if I lead you there? ' 

'I will,' said Gimli eagerly. 

'I will,' said Aragorn heavily. 'You followed my lead almost to 
disaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will follow your 
lead now — if this last warning does not move you. It is not of the Ring, 
nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to 
you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware! ’ 

'I will not go,' said Boromir; 'not unless the vote of the whole 
company is against me. What do Legolas and the little folk say? The 




Ring-bearer's voice surely should be heard? ’ 

I do not wish to go to Moria,' said Legolas. 

The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. 'I 
do not wish to go,' he said; 'but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of 
Gandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until we have slept on it. 
Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold 
gloom. How the wind howls ! ' 

At these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind 
hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round 
them in the empty spaces of the night. 

Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. 'How the wind howls ! ' he cried. 

'It is howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west of the Mountains! 

f 

'Need we wait until morning then? ' said Gandalf. 'It is as I said. The 
hunt is up! Even if we live to see the dawn, who now will wish to journey 
south by night with the wild wolves on his trail? ’ 

'How far is Moria? ' asked Boromir. 

'There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the 
crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly. 

'Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,' said 
Boromir. 'The wolf that one hears is worse than the ore that one fears.' 

'True!' said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. 'But where the 
warg howls, there also the ore prowls.' 

'I wish I had taken Elrond's advice,' muttered Pippin to Sam. I am no 
good after all. There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer 
in me: these howls freeze my blood. I don't ever remember feeling so 
wretched.' 

'My heart's right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam. 'But we 
aren't etten yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever may 
be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolfs belly.' 

For their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the 
small hill under which they had been sheltering, it was crowned with a knot 
of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones. 

In the midst of this they lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness 
and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs. 

Round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed 
uneasily. Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood. The 




howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and 
sometimes 

further off. In the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering 
over the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a 
gap in the circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at 
them. A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning 
his pack to the assault. 

Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. 'Listen, 

Hound of Sauron! ’ he cried. 'Gandalf is here. Fly, if you value your foul 
skin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.' 

The wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At that 
moment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed his bow. There was a 
hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the ground; the elvish arrow 
had pierced its throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished. 
Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting 
packs had fled. All about them the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on 
the sighing wind. 

The night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting, gleaming 
fitfully through the breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started from sleep. 
Without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the 
camp. A great host of Wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them 
from every side at once. 

'Fling fuel on the fire!’ cried Gandalf to the hobbits. 'Draw your 
blades, and stand back to back!’ 

In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey 
shapes spring over the ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the 
throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a 
great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood 
with 

his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas was 
singing. 

In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, 
a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set 
upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to 
meet the wolves. They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed the 
blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and 
his voice rolled like thunder. 




' Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!' he cried. 

There was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into a 
leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree -top. 

The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the 
defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air 
as it flew, and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain. 

All the others fled. 

Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks; 
a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the 
hill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky. Their enemies were 
routed and did not return. 

'What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin? ' said Sam, she/thing his sword. 

'Wolves won’t get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed 
the hair off my head!’ 

When the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to 
be found, and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead. No trace of 
the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on 
the hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left. 

'It is as I feared,’ said Gandalf. 'These were no ordinary wolves 
hunting for food in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!’ 

That day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command 
of some power that had no longer any use for snow, since they had retreated 
from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things 
that moved in the wild could be seen from far away. The wind had been 
turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The 
clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue. As they 
stood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the 
mountain-tops. 

'We must reach the doors before sunset,’ said Gandalf, ’or I fear we 
shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for 
here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only 
once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago. 

'There it lies,’ he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the 
mountains' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet. In the distance 
could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst, taller than 
the rest, one great grey wall. 'When we left the pass I led you southwards, 
and not back to our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is 




well that I did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and haste 
is needed. Let us go! ' 

'I do not know which to hope,' said Boromir grimly: 'that Gandalf will 
find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost 
for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall 
the likeliest chance. Lead on!’ 

Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard’s side, so eager was he to come to 
Moria. Together they led the Company back towards the mountains. The only 
road of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream, 
the Sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors 
had stood. But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in 
recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, 
only a few miles southwards from their start. 

The morning was passing towards noon, and still the Company wandered 
and scrambled in a barren country of red stones. Nowhere could they see any 
gleam of water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts 
sank. They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the 
night would bring, if it caught them in that lost land, none of them cared 
to think. 

Suddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. He was 
standing on a knoll and pointing to the right. Hurrying up they saw below 
them a deep and narrow channel. It was empty and silent, and hardly a 
trickle of water flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed; 
but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound 
its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad. 

’Ah! Here it is at last! ' said Gandalf. 'This is where the stream ran: 

Sirannon, the Gate-stream, they used to call it. But what has happened to 
the water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy. Come! We must 
hurry on. We are late.' 

The Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along 
the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and 
began to go west. After a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again. 
Before them the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough of 
land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward 
peaks. 

At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been 
veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the 




land to the left, turned and went due east again. Rounding the corner they 
saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and 
jagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that 
seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full. 

'Indeed things have changed! ' said Gandalf. 'But there is no mistaking 
the place. There is all that remains of the Stair Falls. If I remember 
right, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the 
main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level 
ground at the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right 
up to the Walls of Moria, and the Sirannon flowed through it with the road 
beside it. Let us go and see what things are like now ! ' 

They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly 
up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When they reached the top they saw 
that they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of 
the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them the sinking Sun filled the cool 
western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. 
Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had 
been dammed and had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were 
reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and 
impassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo 
see in the frowning stone. 

'There are the Walls of Moria,' said Gandalf, pointing across the 
water. 'And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end 
of the road from Flollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None 
of the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of 
the day. It has an unwholesome look.’ 

'We must find a way round the northern edge,' said Gimli. 'The first 
thing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where 
that will lead us. Even if there were no lake, we could not get our 
baggage-pony up this stair.' 

'But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,’ said 
Gandalf. 'The road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are places 
narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.’ 

'Poor old Bill! ' said Frodo. 'I had not thought of that. And poor Sam! 

I wonder what he will say? ’ 

'I am sorry,' said Gandalf. 'Poor Bill has been a useful companion and 
it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter 




and brought no animal, least of all this one that Sam is fond of, if I had 
had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.’ 

The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky 
high above the sunset, when the Company, with all the speed they could, 
climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked 
to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it 
stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its 
northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between 
the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a 
rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two 
to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was 
making for; and then he had still to find the doors. 

When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a 
narrow creek that barred their way. It was green and stagnant, thrust out 
like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward 
undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at 
the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for 
under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was 
treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean 
water on his feet. 

As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on 
the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a 
fish had disturbed the still surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw 
ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were 
widening outwards from a point far out in the lake. There was a bubbling 
noise, and then silence. The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the 
sunset were veiled in cloud. 

Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as 
quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry land between the lake 
and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and 
encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the 
cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. A mile 
southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps and dead 
boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets, 
or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But 
close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, . two tall 
trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined. 




Their great roots spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming 
cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of 
the Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing 
deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the 
end of the road. 

'Well, here we are at last! 'said Gandalf. 'Here the Elven-way from 
Hollin ended. Holly was the token of the people of that land, and they 
planted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the West -door was made 
chiefly for their use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those were 
happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of 
different race, even between Dwarves and Elves.' 

'It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned,' said 
Gimli. 

'I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,' said Legolas. 

'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement now. 

But I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at least to be friends, and to help 
me. I need you both. The doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find 
them the better. Night is at hand! ' 

Turning to the others he said: 'While I am searching, will you each 
make ready to enter the Mines? For here I fear we must say farewell to our 
good beast of burden. You must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought 
against bitter weather: you will not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we 
come through and journey on down into the South. Instead each of us must 
take a share of what the pony carried, especially the food and the 
water-skins.' 

'But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. 
Gandalf! ' cried Sam, angry and distressed. 'I won't have it, and that's 
flat. After he has come so far and all ! ' 

'I am sorry, Sam,' said the wizard. 'But when the Door opens I do not 
think you will be able to drag your Bill inside, into the long dark of 
Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.’ 

'He'd follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon's den, if I led him,' protested 
Sam. 'It'd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these 
wolves about.' 

'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf. He laid his hand on 
the pony's head, and spoke in a low voice. 'Go with words of guard and 
guiding on you,’ he said. 'You are a wise beast, and have learned much in 




Rivendell. Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in 
time to Elrond's house, or wherever you wish to go. 

'There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and 
getting home as we have.’ 

Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to 
understand well what was going on, nuzzled up to him, putting his nose to 
Sam's ear. Sam burst into tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all 
the pony's packs and throwing them on the ground. The others sorted out the 
goods, making a pile of all that could be left behind, and dividing up the 
rest. 

When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared to have 
done nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall 
of the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes. Gimli was 
wandering about, tapping the stone here and there with his axe. Legolas was 
pressed against the rock, as if listening. 

'Well, here we are and all ready,' said Merry; 'but where are the 
Doors? I can't see any sign of them.' 

'Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,' said Gimli. 'They are 
invisible, and their own masters cannot find them or open them, if their 
secret is forgotten.' 

'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said 
Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round. 'Unless things are 
altogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.’ 

He walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the trees 
there was a smooth space, and over this he passed his hands to and fro, 
muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back. 

'Look!' he said. 'Can you see anything now?’ 

The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see 
nothing else for a while. Then slowly on the surface, where the wizard's 
hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running 
in the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine 
that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught them, but steadily 
they grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed. 

At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing 
letters in an Elvish character. Below, though the threads were in places 
blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer 




surmounted by a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees, 
each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in 
the middle of the door a single star with many rays. 

'There are the emblems of Dunn!' cried Gimli. 

'And there is the Tree of the High Elves!' said Legolas. 

'And the Star of the House of Flanor,' said Gandalf. 'They are wrought 
of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it 
is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is 
long since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them to 
my mind.’ 

’What does the writing say?’ asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher 
the inscription on the arch. ’I thought I knew the elf-letters but I cannot 
read these.’ 

'The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the 
Elder Days,’ answered Gandalf. ’But they do not say anything of importance 
to us. They say only: The Doors ofDurin, Lord ofMoria. Speak, friend, and 
enter. And underneath small and faint is written: I, Narvi, made them. 
Celebrimbor ofHollin drew these signs.' 

'What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter!' asked Merry. 

’That is plain enough,’ said Gimli. 'If you are a friend, speak the 
password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.’ 

’Yes,' said Gandalf, 'these doors are probably governed by words. Some 
dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for particular persons; and 
some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and 
words are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not 
secret. They usually stood open and doorwards sat here. But if they were 
shut, any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so 
it is recorded, is it not, Gimli? ' 

'It is,' said the dwarf. 'But what the word was is not remembered. 

Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.’ 

’But do not you know the word, Gandalf? ’ asked Boromir in surprise. 

'No! ’ said the wizard. 

The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, 
remained silent and unmoved. 

’Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?’ cried 
Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at the dark water. 'You told us that 
you had once passed through the Mines. How could that be, if you did not 




know how to enter? ' 

'The answer to your first question, Boromir,’ said the wizard, 'is that 
I do not know the word-yet. But we shall soon see. And,’ he added, with a 
glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, 'you may ask what is the use 
of my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: do you 
doubt my tale? Or have you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I came 
from the East. 

'If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards. 

From the inside you may thrust them open with your hands. From the outside 
nothing will move them save the spell of command. They cannot be forced 
inwards.’ 

'What are you going to do then? ’ asked Pippin, undaunted by the 
wizard's bristling brows. 

'Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf. 'But 
if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish 
questions, I will seek for the opening words. 

'I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Ores 
that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score of 
them without searching in my mind. But only a few trials, I think, will be 
needed; and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret 
dwarf-tongue that they teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like 
the writing on the arch: that seems certain.' 

Ele stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the 
silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil. 

Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! 

Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen! 

he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank 
grey stone did not stir. 

Many times he repeated these words in different order, or varied them. 
Then he tried other spells, one after another, speaking now faster and 
louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech. 
Nothing happened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars were 
kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast. 

Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in 
tones of command and rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, and struck the rock 
with his staff. Open, open! he shouted, and followed it with the same 
command in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of 




Middle-earth. Then he threw his staff on the ground, and sat down in 
silence. 

At that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the 
howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and Sam sprang to his side 
and whispered softly to him. 

'Do not let him run away! ' said Boromir. 'It seems that we shall need 
him still, if the wolves do not find us. How I hate this foul pool! ' He 
stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water. 

The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant there was 
a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond 
where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards the foot of the 
cliff. 

’Why did you do that, Boromir? ' said Frodo. V I hate this place, too, 
and I am afraid. I don't know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the 
doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool. Don't disturb it! ' 

'1 wish we could get away! ' said Merry. 

'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? ' said Pippin. 

Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed, either in 
despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was heard 
again. The ripples on the water grew and came closer; some were already 
lapping on the shore. 

With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. 

He was laughing! V I have it! ' he cried. 'Of course, of course! Absurdly 
simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.' 

Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear 
voice: Mellon! 

The star shone out briefly and faded again. Then silently a great 
doorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had been visible before. 
Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch, until both 
doors lay back against the wall. Through the opening a shadowy stair could 
be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was 
deeper than the night. The Company stared in wonder. 

V I was wrong after all,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli too. Merry, of all 
people, was on the right track. The opening word was inscribed on the 
archway all the time! The translation should have been: Say "Friend" and 
enter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the doors opened. 
Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. 




Those were happier times. Now let us go!' 

He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that 
moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize him by the ankle, 
and he fell with a cry. Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned 
tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped after 
him, and then hearing Frodo’s cry he ran back again, weeping and cursing. 
The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host 
of snakes were swimming up from the southern end. 

Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was 
pale-green and luminous and wet. Its fingered end had hold of Frodo's foot 
and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it 
with a knife. 

The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. 
Twenty others arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a 
hideous stench. 

'Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick! ' shouted Gandalf leaping 
back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to 
the ground where they stood, he drove them forward. 

They were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and 
Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across 
the narrow shore and fingered the cliff- wall and the doors. One came 
wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight. Gandalf turned 
and paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate again from 
within, there was no need. Many coiling arms seized the doors on either 
side, and with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering echo 
they slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came 
dully through the ponderous stone. 

Sam, clinging to Frodo’s arm, collapsed on a step in the black 
darkness. 'Poor old Bill! ’ he said in a choking voice. 'Poor old Bill! 
Wolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had to choose, 
Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.’ 

They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against 
the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the 
doors did not open. 'Well, well! ’ said the wizard. 'The passage is blocked 
behind us now and there is only one way out— on the other side of the 
mountains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the 
trees uprooted and thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the trees were 




beautiful, and had stood so long.' 

'I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot 
first touched the water,' said Frodo. 'What was the thing, or were there 
many of them? ' 

'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one 
purpose. Something has crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under 
the mountains. There are older and fouler things than Ores in the deep 
places of the world.' He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it 
was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the 
Company. 

Boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the 
sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: 'In the deep places of the 
world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us nowin 
this deadly dark? ' 

'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff! 

t 

As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff 
aloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was 
sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow; 
and 

at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into 
the dark. 

'Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, 
since we can't find a dining-room! ' said Frodo. He had begun to shake off 
the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry. 

The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, 
dim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a 
third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell. 

'It will not last much longer, I am afraid,’ he said; 'but I think we 
need it after that horror at the gate. And unless we have great luck, we 
shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with 
the water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines, but they 
should not be touched. We may not have a chance of filling our skins and 
bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.' 

'How long is that going to take us? ' asked Frodo. 

'I cannot say,' answered Gandalf. 'It depends on many chances. But 
going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or 




four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West -door to 
East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.' 

After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager 
to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as 
they were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in 
front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light 
of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his 
sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light 
as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and 
he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting 
or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish 
smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Ores 
were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the 
young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked 
Aragorn. 

The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It 
went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again. The 
air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt 
currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings 
in the walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the wizard's 
staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and 
tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on 
either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering. 

Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least 
he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in 
itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was 
doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of 
Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Gluin's son, 
dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of 
a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and 
despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did 
not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal. 

'Do not be afraid! ' said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, 
and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded 
behind, waiting anxiously. 'Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a 
journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales of Rivendell of 
greater deeds of his than any that I have seen. He will not go astray-if 




there is any path to find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he 
will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is surer of finding 
the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Ber®thiel.' 

It was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had no 
fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors 
many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have 
come to grief. There were not only many roads to choose from, there were 
also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in 
which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls 
and floor, and every now and then a crack would open right before their 
feet. The widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before 
Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap. The noise 
of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was 
turning in the depths. 

'Rope! ' muttered Sam. 'I knew I'd want it, if I hadn't got it! ' 

As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. 
Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the 
mountains' roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort 
in the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo's spirits had risen for a while 
after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a 
deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. Though he had been 
healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been 
without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could 
not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could 
see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And 
he was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against 
his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of 
evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on 
the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly. 

The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers. 
There was no sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of 
Gimli's dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas; 
the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm 
footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment 
they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and 
drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, 
something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud 




enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once 
it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was 
not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, 
and then grew still. 

It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had been 
going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his 
first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three 
passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the 
left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the 
middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow. 

'I have no memory of this place at all!' said Gandalf, standing 
uncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some 
marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was 
to be seen. I am too weary to decide,' he said, shaking his head. 'And I 
expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt 
here for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever 
dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middle-night has 
passed.' 

'Poor old Bill! ' said Sam. 'I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves 
haven't got him yet.' 

To the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half 
closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie 
a wide chamber cut in the rock. 

'Steady! Steady! ' cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, 
glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of 
shelter than in the open passage. 'Steady! You do not know what is inside 
yet. I will go first.’ 

He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. 'There! ’ he said, 
pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw 
a large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at 
the edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near. 

'One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were 
going to strike the bottom,' said Aragorn to Merry. 'Let the guide go first 
while you have one.' 

'This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the 
three passages,' said Gimli. 'That hole was plainly a well for the guards' 
use, covered with a stone lid. But the lid is broken, and we must all take 




care in the dark.' 

Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were 
unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far 
as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered 
over. A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths. 
Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. He 
felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then far below, 
as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there 
came a plunk , very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft. 

'What's that? ' cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin confessed 
what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting. 
’Fool of a Took! ' he growled. 'This is a serious journey, not a hobbit 
walking -party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further 
nuisance. Now be quiet! ' 

Nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of 
the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and when the echoes 
had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They 
sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the 
knocking died away and was not heard again. 

'That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,' said 
Gimli. 

'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do 
with Peregrin's foolish stone; but probably something has been disturbed 
that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind again! 

Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can 
go on the first watch, as a reward,' he growled, as he rolled himself in a 
blanket. 

Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on 
turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the 
well. He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he 
dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep. 

Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep 
in thought, trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the 
Mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a 
false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up and came over 
to Pippin. 

'Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,' he said in a kindly tone. 




'You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the 
watching.' 

'I know what is the matter with me,' he muttered, as he sat down by the 
door. 'I need smoke ! I have not tasted it since the morning before the 
snowstorm.' 

The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse 
of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his 
gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp 
nose, and the puff of smoke. 

It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched 
all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest. 'And in the 
watches I have made up my mind,' he said. 'I do not like the feel of the 
middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul 
air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is 
time we began to climb up again.' 

For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on; 
and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint 
gleam of the wizard's light, bobbing like a will-o'-the-wisp in front of 
them. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they 
could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier 
and wider. There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on 
either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks. 
Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they 
went forward quicker than they had done on their first march. 

In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line 
east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more. As the 
road climbed upwards' Frodo's spirits rose a little; but he still felt 
oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the 
Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep 
that was not an echo. 

They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and 
all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls 
to right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some arched 
doorway into a black and empty space. There was a great draught of warmer 
air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. They 
halted and crowded anxiously together. 

Gandalf seemed pleased. 'I chose the right way,' he said. 'At last we 




are coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from 
the eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the Dimrill 
Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide 
hall. I will now risk a little real light.' 

He raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was blaze like a 
flash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they 
saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of 
stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black 
walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. Three other 
entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, 
and one on either side. Then the light went out. 

'That is all that I shall venture on for the present,' said Gandalf. 

'There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out 
to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached them 
now, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning. If I 
am right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. But in the 
meanwhile we had better go no further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have 
gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are 
not through yet, and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the 
world.' 

The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close 
together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady 
inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as they lay 
hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the 
loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs 
and passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to 
the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria. 

'There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time ' said 
Sam; 'and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to 
make all this, and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for? They 
didn't live in these darksome holes surely? ' 

'These are not holes,’ said Gimli. 'This is the great realm and city of 
the Dwarrowdelf. And of old it was not darksome, but full of light and 
splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.' 

He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, 
while the echoes ran away into the roof. 

The world was young, the mountains green, 




No stain yet on the Moon was seen, 

No words were laid on stream or stone 
When Durin woke and walked alone. 

He named the nameless hills and dells; 
He drank from yet untasted wells; 

He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, 
And saw a crown of stars appear, 

As gems upon a silver thread, 

Above the shadow of his head. 

The world was fair, the mountains tall, 
In Elder Days before the fall 
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond 
And Gondolin, who now beyond 
The Western Seas have passed away: 
The world was fair in Durin 's Day. 

A king he was on carven throne 
In many-pillared halls of stone 
With golden roof and silver floor, 

And runes of power upon the door. 

The light of sun and star and moon 
In shining lamps of crystal hewn 
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night 
There shone for ever fair and bright. 

There hammer on the anvil smote, 

There chisel clove, and graver wrote; 
There forged was blade, and bound was 
The delver mined, the mason built. 
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, 

And metal wrought like fishes' mail, 
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, 
And shining spears were laid in hoard. 

Unwearied then were Durin 's folk 
Beneath the mountains music woke: 




The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, 
And at the gates the trumpets rang. 



The world is grey, the mountains old, 

The forge's fire is ashen-cold 
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: 

The darkness dwells in Durin 's halls 
The shadow lies upon his tomb 
In Moria, in Khazad-dym. 

But still the sunken stars appear 
In dark and windless Mirrormere; 

There lies his crown in water deep, 

Till Durin wakes again from sleep. 

'I like that! ' said Sam. V I should like to learn it. In Moria, in 
Khazad-dym ! But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those 
lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still? ' 

Gimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more. 

'Piles of jewels? ' said Gandalf. 'No. The Ores have often plundered 
Moria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. And since the dwarves fled, 
no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they 
are drowned in water— or in a shadow of fear.' 

'Then what do the dwarves want to come back for? ’ asked Sam. 

’For mithrif answered Gandalf. 'The wealth of Moria was not in gold 
and jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things 
they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve 
for them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For 
here alone in the world was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have 
called it: mithril is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do 
not tell. Its worth was ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond price; 
for little is left above ground, and even the Ores dare not delve here for 
it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, and down to darkness. The 
Dwarves tell no tale; but even as mithril was the foundation of their 
wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too 
deep, and disturbed that from which they fled, Durin’s Bane. Of what they 
brought to light the Ores have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute 
to Sauron, who covets it. 

' Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and 




polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet 
harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver, 
but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim. The Elves dearly 
loved it, and among many uses they made of it ithildin , starmoon, which you 
saw upon the doors. Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave 
him. I wonder what has become of it? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving 
Mathom-house, I suppose.' 

'What? ' cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. 'A corslet of 
Moria- silver? That was a kingly gift! ’ 

'Yes,' said Gandalf. I never told him, but its worth was greater than 
the value of the whole Shire and everything in it.' 

Frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the 
rings of his mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking 
about with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt 
no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now 
his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to 
Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there. He wished 
with all his heart that he was back there, and in those days, mowing the 
lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of Moria, 
or mithril — or the Ring. 

A deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was on 
guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep 
places, dread came over him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He 
listened. All his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow 
hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall. 

His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the 
western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points of 
light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. 'I must 
have nearly fallen asleep on guard,' he thought. 'I was on the edge of a 
dream.' He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into 
the dark, until he was relieved by Legolas. 

When he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that 
the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light 
approaching, slowly. He woke and found that the others were speaking softly 
near him, and that a dim light was falling on his face. High up above the 
eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and 
across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and 




distantly. 

Frodo sat up. 'Good morning! 'said Gandalf: 'For morning it is again 
at last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the east side of Moria. 
Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of 
Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.' 

'I shall be glad,' said Gimli. 'I have looked on Moria, and it is very 
great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my 
kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.' 

After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. 'We 
are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,’ he said. 'I think 
that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria.’ 

'No indeed! ’ said Boromir. 'Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward 
arch? ’ 

’Maybe,’ said Gandalf. 'But I du not know yet exactly where we are. 
Unless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above and to the north of the 
Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The 
eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before 
we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light 
in the north door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that 
the light comes only down deep shafts.’ 

Following his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They 
found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the glimmer grew 
stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was 
high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing 
half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to 
their eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, 
and they blinked as they entered. 

Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among 
things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out. 
The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it 
slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be 
seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the 
room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a 
great slab of white stone. 

'It looks like a tomb,’ muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a 
curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. Gandalf came 
quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven: 




These are Daeron's Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,' said 
Gandalf. 'Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves: 
balin son of fundin 
lord of moria.' 

'He is dead then,' said Frodo. T feared it was so.' Gimli cast his 
hood over his face. 




Chapter 5 . The Bridge of Khazad-dym 



The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo 
thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and of Balin's 
visit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in the mountains it 
seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world. 

At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything 
that would give them tidings of Balin's fate, or show what had become of his 
folk. There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under 
the shaft. By both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying, 
and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and 
helms. Some of the swords were crooked: ore-scimitars with blackened blades. 

There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were 
large iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken and plundered; but 
beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. It had been 
slashed and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and 
other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. Gandalf 
lifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the 
slab. He pored over it for some time without speaking. Frodo and Gimli 
standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they 
were written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale, 
and here and there in Elvish script. 

At last Gandalf looked up. 'It seems to be a record of the fortunes of 
Balin's folk,' he said. V I guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill 
Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers referring to 
the years after their arrival. The top page is marked one — three, so at 
least two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this! 

'We drove out ores from the great gate and guard — I think; the next 
word is blurred and burned; probably room — we slew many in the bright — I 
think — sun in the dale. Flui was killed by an arrow. He slew the great. 

Then there is a blur followed by Flui under grass near Mirror mere. The next 
line or two I cannot read. Then comes We have taken the twentyfirst hall of 
North end to dwell in. There is I cannot read what. A shaft is mentioned. 

Then Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul.' 

'The Chamber of Records,' said Gimli. V I guess that is where we now 




stand.' 

'Well, I can read no more for a long way,' said Gandalf, ’except the 
word gold , and Darin 's Axe and something helm. Then Balin is now lord of 
Morici. That seems to end a chapter. After some stars another hand begins, 
and I can see we found truesilver, and later the word wellforged and then 
something, I have it! mithril; and the last two lines Uin to seek for the 
upper armouries of Third Deep, something go westwards, a blur, to Hollin 
gate' 

Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. 'There are several pages of 
the same sort, rather hastily written and much damaged, he said; 'but I can 
make little of them in this light. Now there must be a number of leaves 
missing, because they begin to be numbered five, the fifth year of the 
colony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut and stained; I cannot 
read them. We might do better in the sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a 
large bold hand using an Elvish script.’ 

’That would be Ori's hand,' said Gimli, looking over the wizard's arm. 

'He could write well and speedily, and often used the Elvish characters.’ 

'I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,' said Gandalf. 

'The first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it 
ends in estre. Yes, it must be yestre followed by day being the tenth of 
novembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone to look in 
Mirror mere, an ore shot him from behind a stone, we slew the ore, hut many 
more ...up from east up the Silverlode. The remainder of the page is so 
blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think I can read we have 
barred the gates, and then can hold them long if, and then perhaps horrible 
and suffer. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept the title that he took for 
less than five years. I wonder what happened afterwards; but there is no 
time to puzzle out the last few pages. Here is the last page of all.' He 
paused and sighed. 

'It is grim reading,' he said. 'I fear their end was cruel. Listen! We 
cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second 
hall. Frbr and Luni and Nbli fell there. Then there are four lines smeared 
so that I can only read went 5 days ago. The last lines run the pool is up 
to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took Uin. We cannot get 
out. The end comes, and then drums, drums in the deep. I wonder what that 
means. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf-letters: they 
are coming. There is nothing more.' Gandalf paused and stood in silent 




thought. 

A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company. ' We 
cannot get out,' muttered Gimli. 'It was well for us that the pool had sunk 
a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end.' 

Gandalf raised his head and looked round. 'They seem to have made a 
last stand by both doors,' he said; 'but there were not many left by that 
time. So ended the attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The 
time is not come yet. Now, I fear, we must say farewell to Balin son of 
Fundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. We will take this 
book, the Book of Mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. You had 
better keep it, Gimli, and take it back to Dbin, if you get a chance. It 
will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The 
morning is passing.' 

'Which way shall we go? ' asked Boromir. 

'Back to the hall,' answered Gandalf. 'But our visit to this room has 
not been in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the 
Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end. 
Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear right 
and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh 
Level, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall! 

f 

Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a 
rolling Boom that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in 
the stone at their feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm. Doom, doom 
it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria 
into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown 
in the hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off. 

There was a hurrying sound of many feet. 

'They are coming! ’ cried Legolas. 

'We cannot get out,' said Gimli. 

'Trapped! ' cried Gandalf. 'Why did I delay? Here we are, caught, just 
as they were before. But I was not here then. We will see what — ' 

Doom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook. 

'Slam the doors and wedge them! ' shouted Aragorn. 'And keep your packs 
on as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.' 

'No! ' said Gandalf. 'We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar! 

We will go that way, if we get a chance.' 




Another harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming 
down the corridor. There was a ring and clatter as the Company drew their 
swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, and Sting glinted at the edges. 
Boromir set his shoulder against the western door. 

'Wait a moment! Do not close it yet! ' said Gandalf. He sprang forward 
to Boromir's side and drew himself up to his full height. 

'Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria? ' he 
cried in a loud voice. 

There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding stones 
into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom, 
boom, 

doom went the drums in the deep. 

With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the 
door and thrust forward his staff: There was a dazzling flash that lit the 
chamber and the passage outside. For an instant the wizard looked out. 
Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back. 

'There are Ores, very many of them,' he said. 'And some are large and 
evil: black Uruks of Mordor. For the moment they are hanging back, but there 
is something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, or more than one. 

There is no hope of escape that way.' 

'And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,' said 
Boromir. 

'There is no sound outside here yet,' said Aragorn, who was standing by 
the eastern door listening. 'The passage on this side plunges straight down 
a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it is no good 
flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind. We cannot block the 
door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must 
do something to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of 
Mazarbul!’ he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword, And®ril. 

Heavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung himself against 
the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and 
splinters of wood. The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber. 
But they had no chance to fly yet. There was a blow on the door that made it 
quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A 
huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust 
through the widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced 
through below. There was a dead silence outside. 




Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his 
sword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his shaken hand. The blade was 
notched. 

Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in 
his heart. 'The Shire! ' he cried, and springing beside Boromir, he stooped, 
and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot 
jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo's arm. Black drops dripped 
from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir hurled himself against the 
door and slammed it again. 

'One for the Shire! ' cried Aragorn. 'The hobbit's bite is deep! You 
have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo ! ' 

There was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams and 
hammers were beating against it. It cracked and staggered back, and the 
opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, but struck the 
northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor. There was a horn-blast and 
a rush of feet, and ores one after another leaped into the chamber. 

How many there were the Company could not count. The affray was sharp, 
but the ores were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence. Legolas shot 
two through the throat. Gimli hewed the legs from under another that had 
sprung up on Balin' s tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When thirteen 
had 

fallen the rest fled shrieking, leaving the defenders unharmed, except for 
Sam who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he 
had felled his ore: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was 
smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step 
backwards, if he had seen it. 

'Now is the time! ' cried Gandalf. 'Let us go, before the troll 
returns!' 

But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the 
stair outside, a huge ore-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail 
from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers 
clustered in the doorway. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like 
coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust of 
his huge hide shield he turned Boromir's sword and bore him backwards, 
throwing him to the ground. Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a 
striking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with his spear 
straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was 




hurled against the wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the 
spear- shaft, and it broke. But even as the ore flung down the truncheon and 
swept out his scimitar, And®ril came down upon his helm. There was a flash 
like flame and the helm burst asunder. The ore fell with cloven head. His 
followers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them. 

Doom, doom went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled out 
again. 

'Now! ' shouted Gandalf. 'Now is the last chance. Run for it! ' 

Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the 
stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him. The others followed; but 
Gimli had to be dragged away by Legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered 
by Balin's tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled the eastern door to, 
grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on either side, but could 
not be fastened. 

'I am all right,' gasped Frodo. 'I can walk. Put me down! ' 

Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. 'I thought you were dead! 

' he cried. 

'Not yet! ' said Gandalf. 'But there is time for wonder. Off you go, 
all of you, down the stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if 
I do not come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose paths leading right and 
downwards.' 

'We cannot leave you to hold the door alone! ' said Aragorn. 

'Do as I say! ' said Gandalf fiercely. 'Swords are no more use here. 

Go!' 

The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their 
way down a long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they could see 
nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard's staff. He 
seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door. Frodo breathed 
heavily and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood 
peering up the stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought he could hear the 
voice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with 
a sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls seemed to be 
trembling. Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: doom, 
doom. 

Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. Then 
there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly: 




doom-boom, doom-boom, and then stopped. Gandalf came flying down the 
steps 

and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company. 

'Well, well! That's over! ' said the wizard struggling to his feet. 'I 
have done all that I could. But I have met my match, and have nearly been 
destroyed. But don't stand here! Go on! You will have to do without light 
for a while: I am rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where are you, Gimli? Come 
ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!' 

They stumbled after him wondering what had happened. Doom, doom 
went 

the drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were 
following. There was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor 
any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to 
be going in the direction that he desired. Every now and again it descended 
a flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. At the moment that was 
their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they 
came on it, and put their feet out into emptiness. Gandalf felt the ground 
with his staff like a blind man. 

At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and 
had descended many flights of stairs. There was still no sound of pursuit. 
Almost they began to hope that they would escape. At the bottom of the 
seventh flight Gandalf halted. 

'It is getting hot! ' he gasped. 'We ought to be down at least to the 
level of the Gates now. Soon I think we should look for a left-hand turn to 
take us east. I hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a 
moment, even if all the ores ever spawned are after us.' 

Gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. 'What 
happened away up there at the door? ’ he asked. 'Did you meet the beater of 
the drums? ’ 

’I do not know,' answered Gandalf. 'But I found myself suddenly faced 
by something that I have not met before. I could think of nothing to do but 
to try and put a shutting -spell on the door. I know many; but to do things 
of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by 
strength. 

'As I stood there I could hear ore- voices on the other side: at any 
moment I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what was said; 
they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was 




ghvsh; that is "fire". Then something came into the chamber — I felt it 
through the door, and the ores themselves were afraid and fell silent. It 
laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell. 

’What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge. 

The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door 
left my control and began to open ! I had to speak a word of Command. That 
proved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as a 
cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down 
the stairs. All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I 
think. 

'I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried 
there too. I cannot say. But at least the passage behind us was completely 
blocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is passing. And now what 
about you, Frodo? There was not time to say so, but I have never been more 
delighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that it was a brave but 
dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.’ 

'What about me? ' said Frodo. 'I am alive, and whole I think. I am 
bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.’ 

'Well,' said Aragorn, 'I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff 
so tough that I have never met the like of it. Had I known, I would have 
spoken softer in the Inn at Bree! That spear -thrust would have skewered a 
wild boar! ’ 

’Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,’ said Frodo; 'though I 
feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.’ He said no 
more. He found breathing painful. 

’You take after Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. 'There is more about you than 
meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.’ Frodo wondered if the remark 
meant more than it said. 

They now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen eyes in 
the dark. 'I think,’ he said, 'that there is a light ahead. But it is not 
daylight. It is red. What can it be? ’ 

' Ghvsh !' muttered Gandalf. 'I wonder if that is what they meant: that 
the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.’ 

Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It was 
flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them. They 
could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way 
ahead there stood a low archway; through it the glowing light came. The air 




became very hot. 

When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to 
wait. As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red 
glow. Quickly he stepped back. 

'There is some new devilry here,' he said, 'devised for our welcome no 
doubt. But I know now where we are: we have reached the First Deep, the 
level immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and 
the Gates are near: away beyond the eastern end, on the left, not more than 
a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road 
through the First Hall, and out! But come and look! ' 

They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier 
and far longer than the one in which they had slept. They were near its 
eastern end; westward it ran away into darkness. Down the centre stalked a 
double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees 
whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems 
were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides. 
Right across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great 
fissure had opened. Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again 
flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps 
of dark smoke wavered in the hot air. 

'If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should 
have been trapped here,' said Gandalf. 'Let us hope that the fire now lies 
between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.' 

Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, 
doom. Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came 
cries and horn-calls. Doom, doom : the pillars seemed to tremble and the 
flames to quiver. 

'Now for the last race! ’ said Gandalf. 'If the sun is shining outside 
we may still escape. After me! ' 

He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The 
distance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they heard the beat and 
echo of many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: they had been 
seen. There was a ring and clash of steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo's 
head. 

Boromir laughed. 'They did not expect this,’ he said. 'The fire has cut 
them off. We are on the wrong side! ’ 

'Look ahead! ' called Gandalf. 'The Bridge is near. It is dangerous and 




narrow.’ 

Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the 
floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The outer door could only be 
reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the 
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet. It was an ancient defence of 
the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the 
outer passages. They could only pass across it in single file. At the brink 
Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind. 

'Lead the way, Gimli! ' he said. 'Pippin and Merry next. Straight on 
and up the stair beyond the door! ' 

Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another 
pierced Gandalf s hat and stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked 
behind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be 
hundreds of ores. They brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as 
blood in the firelight. Doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and 
louder, doom, doom. 

Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long 
shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to 
the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two great trolls appeared; 
they bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways 
over the fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with 
terror. The ranks of the ores had opened, and they crowded away, as if they 
themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them. What it was 
could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a 
dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to 
be in it and to go before it. 

It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had 
bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames 
roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in 
the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand 
was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of 
many thongs. 

'Ai! ai! ' wailed Legolas. 'A Balrog! A Balrog is come! ' 

Gimli stared with wide eyes. 'Durin's Bane! ' he cried, and letting his 
axe fall he covered his face. 

'A Balrog,' muttered Gandalf. 'Now I understand.' He faltered and 
leaned heavily on his staff. 'What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.' 




The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The ores yelled 
and poured over the stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his horn and blew. 
Loud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under 
the cavernous roof. For a moment the ores quailed and the fiery shadow 
halted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark 
wind, and the enemy advanced again. 

'Over the bridge!' cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. "Fly ! This is 
a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly! ' Aragorn and 
Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side, 
behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The others halted just within 
the doorway at the hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to 
face the enemy alone. 

The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, 
leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring 
gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow 
about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs 
whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. 

'You cannot pass,' he said. The ores stood still, and a dead silence 
fell. V I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You 
cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udyn. Go back to the 
Shadow! You cannot pass.' 

The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the 
darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it 
drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to 
wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed 
small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the 
onset of a storm. 

From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming. 

Glamdring glittered white in answer. 

There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell 
back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the 
bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still. 

'You cannot pass! ' he said. 

With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled 
and hissed. 

'He cannot stand alone! ' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the 
bridge. 'Elendil!' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf! ' 




'Gondor! ' cried Boromir and leaped after him. 

At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the 
bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A 
blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the 
Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the 
gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock 
thrust out into emptiness. 

With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged 
down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs 
lashed and curled about the wizard’s knees, dragging him to the brink. He 
staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. 

’Fly, you fools! ' he cried, and was gone. 

The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted 
with horror staring into the pit. Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying 
back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. With a cry Aragorn roused 
them. 

’Come! I will lead you now ! ' he called. 'We must obey his last 
command. Follow me! ' 

They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door. Aragorn 
leading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide echoing passage. Along 
this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then he found that 
he himself was weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom the drum-beats rolled 
behind, mournful now and slow; doom! 

They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. 

They ran swifter. They passed into a hall, bright with daylight from its 
high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors 
they passed, and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an arch of 
blazing light. 

There was a guard of ores crouching in the shadows behind the great 
door posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast 
down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and 
the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and took 
no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and 
age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria. 

Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on 
their faces. 

They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls. 




Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it, 
but eastwards there was a golden light on the land. It was but one hour 
after noon. The sun was shining; the clouds were white and high. 

They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the 
mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats: 
doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the dale 
all around was empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly overcame them, and they 
wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. Doom, doom. 
The drum-beats faded. 




Chapter 6 . Lothlurien 



'Alas! I Fear we cannot stay here longer,' said Aragorn. He looked 
towards the mountains and held up his sword. 'Farewell, Gandalf ! ' he cried. 
'Did I not say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, bewarel Alas that I 
spoke true! What hope have we without you? ' 

He turned to the Company. 'We must do without hope,' he said. 'At least 
we may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep no more! Come! We 
have 

a long road, and much to do.' 

They rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen 
of shadows between two great arms of the mountains, above which three white 
peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras. the Mountains of Moria. 
At the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless 
ladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the 
mountains' feet. 

'Yonder is the Dimrill Stair,' said Aragorn, pointing to the falls. 

'Down the deep-cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have 
come, if fortune had been kinder.' 

'Or Caradhras less cruel,' said Gimli. 'There he stands smiling in the 
sun! ' He shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped peaks and turned 
away. 

To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, 
and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and vague. To the south 
the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than 
a mile away, and a little below them, for they still stood high up on the 
west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a 
great spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end 
was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a 
deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was 
still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides 
to its bare unbroken rim. 

'There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled-zvram! ' said Gimli sadly. 'I 
remember that he said: "May you have joy of the sight! But we cannot linger 
there." Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again. It is I that must 




hasten away, and he that must remain.' 

The Company now went down the road from the Gates. It was rough and 
broken, fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid 
the cracking stones. But still it could be seen that once long ago a great 
paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the Dwarf-kingdom. 

In 

places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green 
topped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. An eastward 
bend led them hard by the sward of Mirrormere, and there not far from the 
roadside stood a single column broken at the top. 

'That is Durin's Stone! ' cried Gimli. 'I cannot pass without turning 
aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale ! ' 

'Be swift then! ' said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates. 'The 
Sun sinks early. The Ores will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we 
must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, and it will be 
dark tonight.' 

'Come with me, Frodo! ' cried the dwarf, springing from the road. 'I 
would not have you go without seeing Kheled-zvram.' He ran down the long 
green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite 
of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind. 

Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It was cracked 
and weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. 'This 
pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere,' said the 
dwarf. 'Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!' 

They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then 
slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound 
blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there 
was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars, 
though sunlight was in the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow 
could be seen. 

'O Kheled-zvram fair and wonderful! ' said Gimli. 'There lies the Crown 
of Durin till he wakes. Farewell! ' He bowed, and turned away, and hastened 
back up the green-sward to the road again. 

'What did you see? ' said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in 
thought to answer. 

The road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from 
between the arms of the dale. Some way below the mere they came on a deep 




well of water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip 
and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel. 

'Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises.' said Gimli. 'Do 
not drink of it! It is icy cold.' 

'Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other 
mountain- streams,' said Aragorn. 'Our road leads beside it for many miles. 
For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to 
come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out 
yonder.' They looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the 
stream leaping down to the trough of the valley, and then running on and 
away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze. 

'There lie the woods of Lothlurien! ’ said Legolas. 'That is the 
fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees 
of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not 
till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the 
boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, 
and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the 
trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would 
be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime ! ’ 

'My heart will be glad, even in the winter,' said Aragorn. 'But it lies 
many miles away. Let us hasten! ' 

For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but 
Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged 
behind. They had eaten nothing since the early morning. Sam's cut was 
burning like fire, and his head felt light. In spite of the shining sun the 
wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt 
every step more painful and he gasped for breath. 

At last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to 
Aragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling to Boromir to come 
with him. 

'I am sorry, Frodo! ' he cried, full of concern. 'So much has happened 
this day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were 
hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease 
you, 

as we ought, though all the ores of Moria were after us. Come now! A little 
further on there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do 
what I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.' 




Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the 
west, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode. Together 
they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone, and foamed down into a dell. 
About it stood fir-trees, short and bent, and its sides were steep and 
clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle -berry. At the bottom there 
was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining 
pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly three hours after noon, and 
they had come only a few miles from the Gates. Already the sun was 
westering. 

While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and 
fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. Sam's wound was 
not 

deep, but it looked ugly, and Aragorn’s face was grave as he examined it. 
After a moment he looked up with relief. 

’Good luck, Sam! ’ he said. 'Many have received worse than this in 
payment for the slaying of their first ore. The cut is not poisoned, as the 
wounds of ore-blades too often are. It should heal well when I have tended 
it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water.' 

He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. 'They are dry 
and some of their virtue has one, he said, but here I have still some of the 
leaves of athelas that I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one in the water, 
and wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your turn. Frodo! ' 

'I am all right,' said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched. 

'All I needed was some food and a little rest.' 

'No! ' said Aragorn. 'We must have a look and see what the hammer and 
the anvil have done to you. I still marvel that you are alive at all.’ 

Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of 
wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like 
the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and 
the gems on it glittered like stars, and the sound of the shaken rings was 
like the tinkle of rain in a pool. 

'Look, my friends!’ he called. 'Here's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an 
el ven -princeling in! If it were known that hobbits had such hides, all the 
hunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the Shire.' 

'And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,' 
said Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. 'It is a mithril-coat. Mithril! I 
have never seen or heard tell of one so fair. Is this the coat that Gandalf 




spoke of? Then he undervalued it. But it was well given! ' 

'I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close in his 
little room,' said Merry. 'Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever. 

I hope we get a chance of telling him about it! ' 

There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast. 
Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings 
had been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo's left side also was scored 
and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall. While the others set 
the food ready. Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was 
steeped. The pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped 
over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the 
pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to 
the touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side. 

'The mail is marvellously light,' he said. 'Put it on again, if you can 
bear it. My heart is glad to know that you have such a coat. Do not lay it 
aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a 
while; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.’ 

When they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They put out the 
fire and hid all traces of it. Then climbing out of the dell they took to 
the road again. They had not gone far before the sun sank behind the 
westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain-sides. Dusk 
veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. Away in the east the 
evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood. Sam and 
Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair 
pace, and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly 
three more hours. 

It was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars, hut 
the fast- waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli and Frodo were at 
the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound upon the 
road behind. At length Gimli broke the silence. 

'Not a sound but the wind,' he said. 'There are no goblins near, or my 
ears are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the Ores will be content with 
driving us from Moria. And maybe that was all their purpose, and they had 
nothing else to do with us-with the Ring. Though Ores will often pursue foes 
for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.’ 

Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull. Yet 
he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon as the shadows had fallen 




about them and the road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter 
of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams 
of light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they 
slipped aside and vanished. 

'What is it? ' said the dwarf. 

'I don't know.' answered Frodo. 'I thought I heard feet, and I thought 
I saw a light-like eyes. I have thought so often, since we first entered 
Moria.' 

Gimli halted and stooped to the ground. 'I hear nothing but the 
night-speech of plant and stone,' he said. 'Come! Let us hurry! The others 
are out of sight.' 

The night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them a 
wide grey shadow loomed, and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like 
poplars in the breeze. 

'Lothlurien! ' cried Legolas. 'Lothlurien! We have come to the eaves of 
the Golden Wood. Alas that it is winter! ' 

Under the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road 
and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In the dim 
light of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint 
of fallow gold. 

'Lothlurien! ' said Aragorn. 'Glad I am to hear again the wind in the 
trees! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates, but we can 
go no further. Here let us hope that the virtue of the Elves will keep us 
tonight from the peril that comes behind.' 

'If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,' said Gimli. 

'It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land 
whence we wandered in ages long ago,' said Legolas, 'but we hear that Lurien 
is not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here that holds evil from 
the land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they dwell now 
deep in the woods and far from the northern border.' 

'Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, and sighed as if 
some memory stirred in him. 'We must fend for ourselves tonight. We will go 
forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn 
aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.' 

He stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow. 

'Is there no other way? ' he said. 

'What other fairer way would you desire? ’ said Aragorn. 




'A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,' said Boromir. 

'By strange paths has this Company been led, and so far to evil fortune. 
Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria, to our loss. And now we 
must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we have heard 
in Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few 
none have escaped unscathed.' 

'Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak 
the truth said Aragorn. But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of 
those who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlurien. Believe what you 
will, there is no other way for us — unless you would go back to 
Moria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or swim the Great River all 
alone.’ 

'Then lead on! ' said Boromir. 'But it is perilous.’ 

'Perilous indeed,' said Aragorn, 'fair and perilous; but only evil need 
fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow me! ' 

They had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came 
upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad slopes that 
climbed back westward towards the mountains. They heard it splashing over a 
fall away among the shadows on their right. Its dark hurrying waters ran 
across the path before them, and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim 
pools among the roots of trees. 

'Here is Nimrodel! ' said Legolas. 'Of this stream the Silvan Elves 
made many songs long ago, and still we sing them in the North, remembering 
the rainbow on its falls, and the golden flowers that floated in its foam. 

All is dark now and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my 
feet, for it is said that the water is healing to the weary.' He went 
forward and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream. 

'Follow me!’ he cried. 'The water is not deep. Let us wade across! On 
the further bank we can rest, and the sound of the falling water may bring 
us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.' 

One by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo 
stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet. It was cold 
but its touch was clean, and as he went on and it mounted to his knees, he 
felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs. 

When all the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little 
food; and Legolas told them tales of Lothlurien that the Elves of Mirkwood 
still kept in their hearts, of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by 




the Great River before the world was grey. 

At length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall 
running sweetly in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a 
voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water. 

'Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel? ' asked Legolas. 'I will sing you a 
song of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same name as the stream beside 
which she lived lung ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this 
is how it runs in the Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.' In 
a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he 
began: 

An Elven-maid there was of old, 

A shining star by day: 

Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, 

Her shoes of silver-grey. 

A star was bound upon her brows, 

A light was on her hair 
As sun upon the golden boughs 
In Lurien the fair. 

Her hair was long, her limbs were white, 

And fair she was and free; 

And in the wind she went as light 
As leaf of linden-tree. 

Beside the falls of Nimrodel, 

By water clear and cool, 

Her voice as falling silver fell 
Into the shining pool. 

Where now she wanders none can tell, 

In sunlight or in shade; 

For lost of yore was Nimrodel 
And in the mountains strayed. 

The elven-ship in haven grey 
Beneath the mountain-lee 




Awaited her for many a day 
Beside the roaring sea. 

A wind by night in Northern lands 
Arose, and loud it cried, 

And drove the ship from elven-strands 
Across the streaming tide. 

When dawn came dim the land was lost, 
The mountains sinking grey 
Beyond the heaving waves that tossed 
Their plumes of blinding spray. 

Amroth beheld the fading shore 
Now low beyond the swell, 

And cursed the faithless ship that bore 
Him far from Nimrodel. 

Of old he was an Elven-king, 

A lord of tree and glen, 

When golden were the boughs in spring 
In fair Lothlurien. 

From helm to sea they saw him leap, 

As arrow from the string, 

And dive into the water deep, 

As mew upon the wing. 

The wind was in his flowing hair, 

The foam about him shone; 

Afar they saw him strong and fair 
Go riding like a swan. 

But from the West has come no word, 
And on the Hither Shore 
No tidings Elven-folk have heard 
Of Amroth evermore. 




The voice of Legolas faltered, and the song ceased. 'I cannot sing any 
more,' he said. 'That is but a part, for I have forgotten much. It is long 
and sad, for it tells how sorrow came upon Lothlurien, Lurien of the 
Blossom, when the Dwarves awakened evil in the mountains.' 

'But the Dwarves did not make the evil,' said Gimli. 

'I said not so; yet evil came,' answered Legolas sadly. 'Then many of 
the Elves of Nimrodel's kindred left their dwellings and departed and she 
was lost far in the South, in the passes of the White Mountains; and she 
came not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited for her. But in the 
spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be 
heard by the falls that bear her name. And when the wind is in the South the 
voice of Amroth comes up from the sea; for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode, 
that Elves call Celebrant, and Celebrant into Anduin the Great, and Anduin 
flows into the Bay of B elf alas whence the Elves of Lurien set sail. But 
neither Nimrodel nor Amroth ever came back. 

'It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that 
grew near the falls; for that was the custom of the Elves of Lurien, to 
dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Therefore they were called the 
Galadhrim, the Tree -people. Deep in their forest the trees are very great. 

The people of the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves, nor build 
strong places of stone before the Shadow came.' 

'And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought 
safer than sitting on the ground,' said Gimli. He looked across the stream 
to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then up into the roof of dark 
boughs above. 

'Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,' said Aragorn. 'We cannot build 
a house, but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and seek refuge in the 
tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside the road already longer than 
was wise.’ 

The Company now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of 
the deeper woods, westward along the mountain-stream away from 
Silverlode. 

Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees, some of 
which overhung the stream. Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but 
their height could not be guessed. 

'I will climb up,’ said Legolas. 'I am at home among trees, by root or 
bough, though these trees are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in 




song. Mellyrn they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, 
but I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is their shape and way 
of growth.' 

'Whatever it may be,' said Pippin, 'they will be marvellous trees 
indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds. I cannot sleep 
on a perch ! ’ 

'Then dig a hole in the ground,' said Legolas, 'if that is more after 
the fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to 
hide from Ores.’ He sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch 
that grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for 
a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him. 

' Daro !' it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to earth 
in surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree. 

'Stand still! ' he whispered to the others. 'Do not move or speak! ’ 

There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another 
clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what 
was said, for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used 
among themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and 
answered 

in the same language.* 

'Who are they, and what do they say? ’ asked Merry. 

'They're Elves,' said Sam. 'Can't you hear their voices? ' 

'Yes, they are Elves,' said Legolas; 'and they say that you breathe so 
loud that they could shoot you in the dark.' Sam hastily put his hand over 
his mouth. 'But they say also that you need have no fear. They have been 
aware of us for a long while. They heard my voice across the Nimrodel, and 
knew that I was one of their Northern kindred, and therefore they did not 
hinder our crossing; and afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me 
climb up with Frodo; for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of 
our journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the 
foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.' 

Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, 
silver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender it 
proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo 
followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches 
of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept 
upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, 




and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or 
flet as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a talan. 

It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder 
passed. 

When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with 
three other Elves. They were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen 
among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of 
them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it 
up, looking at Frodo's face, and Sam's. Then he shut off the light again, 
and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in 
return. 

'Welcome!' the Elf then said again in the Common Fanguage, speaking 
slowly. 'We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart 
of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk. Even 
our own kindred in the North are sundered from us. But there are some of us 
still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our 
enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my 
name. My brothers, R®mil and Orophin, speak little of your tongue. 

'But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of Elrond 
passed by Furien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair. We had not heard of 
hobbits, or halflings, for many a long year, and did not know that any yet 
dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not look evil! And since you come with an Elf 
of our kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as Elrond asked; though it 
is not our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here 
tonight. How many are you? ’ 

'Eight,' said Legolas. 'Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom, 
Aragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.' 

'The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lurien,' said Haldir, 
'and he has the favour of the Lady. All then is well. But you have yet 
spoken only of seven.' 

'The eighth is a dwarf,' said Legolas. 

'A dwarf! ’ said Haldir. 'That is not well. We have not had dealings 
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I 
cannot allow him to pass.' 

'But he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of Dbin's trusty people, and 
friendly to Elrond,' said Frodo. 'Elrond himself chose him to be one of our 
companions, and he has been brave and faithful.' 




The Elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned Legolas in 
their own tongue. 'Very good,' said Haldir at last. 'We will do this, though 
it is against our liking. If Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer 
for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlurien. 

'But now we must debate no longer. Your folk must not remain on the 
ground. We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a great 
troop of Ores going north toward Moria, along the skirts of the mountains, 
many days ago. Wolves are howling on the wood's borders. If you have indeed 
come from Moria, the peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go 
on. 

'The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us- we do not fear 
them! There is another ta Ian in the next tree. There the others must take 
refuge. You, Legolas, must answer to us for them. Call us, if anything is 
amiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!' 

Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir's message; and soon 
afterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the high flet. They were out 
of breath and seemed rather scared. 

'There!' said Merry panting. 'We have lugged up your blankets as well 
as our own. Strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift 
of leaves.’ 

'You had no need of your burdens,' said Haldir. 'It is cold in the 
tree-tops in winter, though the wind tonight is in the South; but we have 
food and drink to give you that will drive away the night-chill, and we have 
skins and cloaks to spare.’ 

The hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly. 

Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the 
Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to go to sleep. But 
weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do. Hobbits do not like 
heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet 
was not at all to their liking as a bedroom. It had no walls, not even a 
rail; only on one side was there a light plaited screen, which could be 
moved and fixed in different places according to the wind. 

Pippin went on talking for a while. 'I hope, if I do go to sleep in 
this bed-loft, that I shan't roll off,' he said. 

'Once I do get to sleep,’ said Sam, ’i shall go on sleeping, whether I 
roll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my 
meaning.' 




Frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting 
through the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side long 
before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see the grey forms of two 
elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking in 
whispers. The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower 
branches. At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet 
murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with the song of 
Legolas running in his mind. 

Late in the night he awoke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves 
were gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind 
was 

still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on 
the ground below. There was a ring of metal. The sounds died slowly away, 
and seemed to go southward, on into the wood. 

A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in 
alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards the hobbits. 

'What is it? ' said Frodo. 

' Yrch !' said the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the 
rope-ladder rolled up. 

'Ores! ' said Frodo. 'What are they doing? ' But the Elf had gone. 

There were no more sounds. Even the leaves were silent, and the very 
falls seemed to be hushed. Frodo sat and shivered in his wraps. He was 
thankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the 
trees offered little protection, except concealment. Ores were as keen as 
hounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. He drew out 
Sting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded 
again and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of 
immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and 
crawled to the opening and peered down. He was almost certain that he could 
hear stealthy movements at the tree’s foot far below. 

Not Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their 
movements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed 
to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk. He stared down into the 
dark, holding his breath. 

Something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft 
hissing through closed teeth. Then coming up, close to the stem, Frodo saw 




two pale eyes. They stopped and gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they 
turned 

away, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished. 

Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the 
branches. 'There was something in this tree that I have never seen before,' 
he said. 'It was not an ore. It fled as soon as I touched the tree -stem. It 
seemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or I might have thought 
that it was one of you hobbits. 

I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk 
battle. A strong company of Ores has passed. They crossed the Nimrodel-curse 
their foul feet in its clean water! -and went on down the old road beside the 
river. They seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a 
while near the place where you halted. The three of us could not challenge a 
hundred, so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on 
into the wood. 

'Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our 
people. None of the Ores will ever return out of Lurien. And there will be 
many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls. But you 
must take the road south as soon as it is fully light.’ 

Day came pale from the East. As the light grew it filtered through the 
yellow leaves of the mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early 
sun of a cool summer's morning was shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among the 
moving branches. Looking through an opening on the south side of the flet 
Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold 
tossing gently in the breeze. 

The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again, 
guided now by Haldir and his brother R®mil. 'Farewell, sweet Nimrodel! ' 
cried Legolas. Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among 
the 

grey tree-stems. 'Farewell,' he said. It seemed to him that he would never 
hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable 
notes in an endless changeful music. 

They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of 
the Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward. There were the 
prints of ore-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees 
and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows. 

'There is one of my people yonder across the stream,' he said 'though 




you may not see him.' He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out 
of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood 
thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully 
cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end 
about a tree near the bank. 

'Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,' said Haldir 
'and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it 
so far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness we do not 
make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!' He made his end of the rope 
fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and 
back again, as if he were on a road. 

V I can walk this path,' said Legolas; 'but the others have not this 
skill. Must they swim?’ 

'No!' said Haldir. 'We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above 
the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and holding these the 
strangers should be able to cross with care.' 

When this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some 
cautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits Pippin proved the 
best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with 
one hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. Sam 
shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water 
as if it was a chasm in the mountains. 

He breathed with relief when he was safely across. 'Live and learn! as 
my gaffer used to say. Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting 
like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy 
ever did a trick like that! ’ 

When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the 
Silverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them. R®mil, who 
had remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it on his 
shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep 
watch. 

'Now, friends,' said Haldir, 'you have entered the Naith of Lurien or 
the Gore, as you would say, for it is the land that lies like a spear -head 
between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great. We allow no strangers 
to spy out the secrets of the Naith. Few indeed are permitted even to set 
foot there. 

'As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf. The 




other may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down 
in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters.' 

This was not at all to the liking of Gimli. 'The agreement was made 
without my consent,' he said. 'I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a 
prisoner. And I am no spy. My folk have never had dealings with any of the 
servants of the Enemy. Neither have we done harm to the Elves. I am no more 
likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.’ 

’I do not doubt you,’ said Haldir. 'Yet this is our law. I am not the 
master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have done much in letting you 
set foot over Celebrant.' 

Gimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his 
hand upon the haft of his axe. 'I will go forward free,' he said, 'or I will 
go back and seek my own land, where I am known to be true of word, though I 
perish alone in the wilderness.' 

'You cannot go back,' said Haldir sternly. 'Now you have come thus far, 
you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge you, to 
hold you or to give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross the rivers 
again, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. 

You would be slain before you saw them.' 

Gimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their 
bows. 'A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks! ' said Legolas. 

'Come!' said Aragorn. 'If I am still to lead this Company, you must do 
as I bid. It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out. We will all be 
blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it will make the journey 
slow and dull.' 

Gimli laughed suddenly. 'A merry troop of fools we shall look! Will 
Haldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But I 
will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.’ 

'I am an Elf and a kinsman here,’ said Legolas, becoming angry in his 
turn. 

'Now let us cry: "a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!"' said Aragorn. 

'But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir! ' 

'I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do 
not lead us well,’ said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes. 

'You will have no claim,' said Haldir. 'I shall lead you well, and the 
paths are smooth and straight.’ 

'Alas for the folly of these days! ’ said Legolas. 'Here all are 




enemies of the one Enemy, and yet I must walk blind, while the sun is merry 
in the woodland under leaves of gold! ' 

'Folly it may seem,' said Haldir. ’Indeed in nothing is the power of 
the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all 
those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in 
the world beyond Lothlurien, unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not by 
our own trust endanger our land. We live now upon an island amid many 
perils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp. 

'The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more for the 
Shadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak of departing, yet for 
that it already seems too late. The mountains to the west are growing evil; 
to the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauron’s creatures; and it is 
rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, and the 
mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come 
to 

the shores of the Sea, we should find no longer any shelter there. It is 
said that there are still havens of. the High Elves, but they are far north 
and west, beyond the land of the Halflings. But where that may be, though 
the Lord and Lady may know, I do not.’ 

'You ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,’ said Merry. 

'There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire where Hobbits live.’ 

'Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea! ’ said 
Haldir. ’It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still 
we remember it in song. Tell me of these havens as we walk.’ 

'I cannot,’ said Merry. 'I have never seen them. I have never been out 
of my own land before. And if I had known what the world outside was like. I 
don’t think I should have had the heart to leave it.’ 

'Not even to see fair Lothlurien? ’ said Haldir. ’The world is indeed 
full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much 
that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it 
grows perhaps the greater. 

'Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back and 
peace shall come again. Yet I do not believe that the world about us will 
ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime. 

For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass 
to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever. Alas for 
Lothlurien that I love! It would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn 




grew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond the Great Sea, none have 
reported it.' 

As they spoke thus, the Company filed slowly along the paths in the 
wood, led by Haldir, while the other Elf walked behind. They felt the ground 
beneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a while they walked more 
freely, without fear of hurt or fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo found 
his hearing and other senses sharpened. He could smell the trees and the 
trodden grass. He could hear many different notes in the rustle of the 
leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right, and the thin clear 
voices of birds in the sky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when 
they passed through an open glade. 

As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange 
feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith: 
it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of 
the Elder Days, and was -now walking in a world that was no more. In 
Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lurien the ancient things 
still lived on in the waking world. Evil had been seen and heard there, 
sorrow had been known; the Elves feared and distrusted the world outside: 
wolves were howling on the wood's borders: but on the land of Lurien no 
shadow lay. 

All that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool evening 
come and heard the early night- wind whispering among many leaves. Then 
they 

rested and slept without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not 
permit them to unbind their eyes, and they could not climb. In the morning 
they went on again, walking without haste. At noon they halted, and Frodo 
was aware that they had passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard 
the sound of many voices all around him. 

A marching host of Elves had come up silently: they were hastening 
toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria; and they 
brought news, some of which Haldir reported. The marauding ores had been 
waylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the 
mountains, and were being pursued. A strange creature also had been seen, 
running with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet 
notofbeast-shape.lt had eluded capture, and they had not shot it, not 
knowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished down the Silverlode 
southward. 




'Also,' said Haldir, "they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of 
the Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that 
the Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company. New 
messages 

have come from Rivendell perhaps.' 

He removed the bandage first from Gimli' s eyes. 'Your pardon! ' he 
said, bowing low. "Look on us now with friendly eyes! Look and be glad, for 
you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the Naith of Lurien since 
Durin's Day! ' 

When his eyes were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up and caught his 
breath. They were standing in an open space. To the left stood a great 
mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as Spring-time in the Elder 
Days. Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had 
bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely 
nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in 
pale gold. High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the 
centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the trees, and all 
about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers 
shaped like stars. Among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other 
flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue 
of the grass. Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed 
upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees. 

'Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,' said Haldir. "For this is the 
heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here is the mound of 
Amroth, where in happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom the 
winter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow elanor, and the pale 
niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the Galadhrim 
at dusk.' 

The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but Frodo 
stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped 
through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it 
for which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but the 
shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and 
drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for 
ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, 
but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first 




perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter here 
no 

heart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or 
deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of 
Lurien there was no stain. 

He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round 
with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that 
he was awake. 'It's sunlight and bright day, right enough,' he said. 'I 
thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than 
anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was inside a song, if you take 
my meaning.' 

Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both 
thought and word. He smiled. 'You feel the power of the Lady of the 
Galadhrim,' he said. 'Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth? 

f 

They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes. 
Though he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were 
stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in 
a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When 
he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer 
from the Shire would walk there, upon the grass among elanor and niphredil 
in fair Lothlurien. 

They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the South Wind 
blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches. Frodo stood still, 
hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, 
and sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth. 

Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. As Frodo 
prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: 
never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and 
texture of a tree's skin and of the life within it. He felt a delight in 
wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the 
delight of the living tree itself. 

As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand 
and turned him toward the South. 'Look this way first! ’ he said. 

Frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty 
trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it, 
it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in 




sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. Then 
he looked eastward and saw all the land of Lurien running down to the pale 
gleam of Anduin, the Great River. He lifted his eyes across the river and 
all the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew. Beyond 
the river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far 
away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. The sun that lay on 
Lothlurien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height. 

'There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,' said Haldir. 'It is 
clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and 
their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol 
Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is 
inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it 
of late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one 
to another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light 
perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been 
discovered. Not yet.' He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed 
him. 

At the hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a 
tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in 
his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he 
knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the 
grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in 
white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue 
to one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, nambril! he said, and then 
he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and 
smiled. 

'Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,' he said, 'and here my heart 
dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still 
must tread, you and I. Come with me! ' And taking Frodo's hand in his, he 
left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man. 




Chapter 7 . The Mirror of Galadriel 



The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were 
deepening in the woods, when they went on again. Their paths now went into 
thickets where the dusk had already gathered. Night came beneath the trees 
as they walked, and the Elves uncovered their silver lamps. 

Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a 
pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. There was a wide treeless 
space before them, running in a great circle and bending away on either 
hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its 
brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone. 
Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a 
green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in 
all the land. Their height could not be guessed, but they stood up in the 
twilight like living towers. In their, many -tiered branches and amid their 
ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and 
silver. Haldir turned towards the Company. 

'Welcome to Caras Galadhon! ' he said. 'Here is the city of the 
Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lurien. 
But we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look northward. We must go 
round to the southern side, and the way is not short, for the city is 
great.' 

There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of 
the fosse. Along this they went westward, with the city ever climbing up 
like a green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened more lights 
sprang forth, until all the hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last 
to a white bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they 
faced south-west, set between the ends of the encircling wall that here 
overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps. 

Haldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of 
guards Lrodo could see no sign. The travellers passed within, and the gates 
shut behind them. They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and 
passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could 
they see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices, 
about them, and in the air above. Ear away up on the hill they could hear 




the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves. 

They went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to 
the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering. 
It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell 
into a basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon the south 
side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great 
smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first 
branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves. 
Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were 
seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they 
were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white 
cloaks. 

'Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,' said Haldir. v It is their wish 
that you should ascend and speak with them.' 

One of the Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it 
was answered three times from far above. V I will go first,' said Haldir. 

'Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas. The others may follow as they 
wish. It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs, 
but you may rest upon the way.' 

As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some 
on another, and some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder 
passed through them. At a great height above the ground he came to a wide 
talan, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large that 
almost it would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth. He entered 
behind Haldir, and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the 
midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its 
crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth. 

The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and 
silver and its roof of gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs 
beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side 
by side, Celeborn and Galadriel. They stood up to greet their guests, after 
the manner of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall 
they were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and 
beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the Lady was of 
deep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright; 
but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their 
eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the 




wells of deep memory. 

Haldir led Frodo before them, and the Lord welcomed him in his own 
tongue. The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face. 

'Sit now beside my chair, Frodo of the Shire! ' said Celeborn. 'When 
all have come we will speak together.' 

Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered. 
'Welcome Aragorn son of Arathorn! ’ he said. 'It is eight and thirty years 
of the world outside since you came to this land; and those years lie heavy 
on you. But the end is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for 
a while ! ' 

'Welcome son of Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from 
the North.' 

'Welcome Gimli son of Gluin! It is long indeed since we saw one of 
Durin's folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our long law. May 
it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand, and 
that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.' Gimli bowed low. 

When all the guests were seated before his chair the Lord looked at 
them again. 'Here there are eight,' he said. 'Nine were to set out: so said 
the messages. But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have 
not heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this 
year the shadows have grown longer.’ 

'Nay, there was no change of counsel,' said the Lady Galadriel speaking 
for the first time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's 
wont. 'Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the 
borders of this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak 
with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the 
fences of Lothlurien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and 
of his mind are hidden from me.’ 

'Alas! ' said Aragorn. 'Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow. He remained 
in Moria and did not escape.' 

At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and 
amazement. 'These are evil tidings,' said Celeborn, 'the most evil that have 
been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.' He turned to Haldir. 
'Why has nothing of this been told to me before? ' he asked in the 
Elven-tongue. 

'We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our purpose,' said 
Legolas. 'At first we were weary and danger was too close behind and 




afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness 
on the fair paths of Lurien.' 

'Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,' said Frodo. 
’Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape 
seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.’ 

Tell us now the full tale! ' said Celeborn: 

Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of 
Caradhras, and in the days that followed; and he spoke of Balin and his 
book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow 
bridge, and the coming of the Terror. 'An evil of the Ancient World it 
seemed, such as I have never seen before,' said Aragorn. 'It was both a 
shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.' 

'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; 'of all elf-banes the most 
deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.’ 

'Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams 1 
saw Durin's Bane,' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes. 

'Alas! ' said Celeborn. 'We long have feared that under Caradhras a 
terror slept. But had I known that the Dwarves had stirred up this evil in 
Moria again, 1 would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders, you 
and all that went with you. And if it were possible, one would say that at 
the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net 
of Moria.' 

'He would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said Galadriel gravely. 
'Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him 
knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be 
with the guide, the followers are blameless. Do not repent of your welcome 
to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlurien, who 
of the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not 
wish 

to look upon their ancient home, though it had become an abode of dragons? 

'Dark is the water of Kheled-zvram, and cold are the springs of 
Kibil-nvla, and fair were the many -pillared halls of Khazad-dym in Elder 
Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone.' She looked upon 
Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the 
names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it 
seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw 
there love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then he smiled 




in answer. 

He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: 'Yet more fair is 
the living land of Lurien, and the Lady Galadriel is above all the jewels 
that lie beneath the earth! ' 

There was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. 'I did not know 
that your plight was so evil,’ he said. 'Let Gimli forget my harsh words: I 
spoke in the trouble of my heart. I will do what I can to aid you, each 
according to his wish and need, but especially that one of the little folk 
who bears the burden.' 

'Your quest is known to us,' said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. 'But we 
will not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, 
that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed. 
For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of 
Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt 
in the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years 
uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the 
mountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought the long 
defeat. 

’I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs had 
not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then 
mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I 
will not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that. For not in doing or 
contriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can I avail; 
but only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be. But 
this I will say to you: your Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray 
but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while 
all the Company is true.’ 

And with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked 
searchingly at each of them in turn. None save Legolas and Aragorn could 
long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed and hung his head. 

At length the Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes, and she 
smiled. 'Do not let your hearts be troubled,' she said. 'Tonight you shall 
sleep in peace.' Then they sighed and felt suddenly weary, as those who have 
been questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken openly. 

'Go now! ' said Celeborn. 'You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even 
if your Quest did not concern us closely, you should have refuge in this 
City, until you were healed and refreshed. Now you shall rest, and we will 




not speak of your further road for a while.' 

That night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction 
of the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near 
the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace 
with fair elvish voices they left them. For a little while the travellers 
talked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day's journey, 
and of the Lord and Lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further 
back. 

'What did you blush for, Sam? ’ said Pippin. 'You soon broke down. 
Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope it was nothing 
worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets.’ 

'I never thought no such thing,’ answered Sam, in no mood for jest. ’If 
you want to know, I felt as if I hadn’t got nothing on, and I didn't like 
it. She seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if she 
gave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hole 
with-with a bit of garden of my own.' 

'That's funny,' said Merry. 'Almost exactly what I felt myself; only, 
only well, I don't think I'll say any more,' he ended lamely. 

All of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was 
offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something 
that he greatly desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had 
only to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against 
Sauron to others. 

'And it seemed to me, too,' said Gimli, 'that my choice would remain 
secret and known only to myself.’ 

'To me it seemed exceedingly strange,' said Boromir. 'Maybe it was only 
a test, and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose; but 
almost I should have said that she was tempting us, and offering what she 
pretended to have the power to give. It need not be said that I refused to 
listen. The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word.’ But what he thought 
that the Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell. 

And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with 
questions. 'She held you long in her gaze, Ring -bearer,’ he said. 

'Yes,' said Frodo; 'but whatever came into my mind then I will keep 
there.' 

'Well, have a care! 'said Boromir. 'I do not feel too sure of this 
Elvish Lady and her purposes.’ 




'Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel! ' said Aragorn sternly. 'You know 
not what you say. There is in her and in this land no evil, unless a man 
bring it hither himself . Then let him beware ! But tonight I shall sleep 
without fear for the first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep 
deep, and forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in heart.' He 
cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep. 

The others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their 
slumber. When they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the 
lawn before the pavilion, and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the 
sun. 

They remained some days in Lothlurien, so far as they could tell or 
remember. All the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear, save for 
a gentle rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all things fresh 
and clean. The air was cool and soft, as if it were early spring, yet they 
felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter. It seemed to them 
that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees; 
and it was enough. 

They had not seen the Lord and Lady again, and they had little speech 
with the Elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue. 
Haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the 
North, where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the 
Company had brought. Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim, and 
after 

the first night he did not sleep with the other companions, though he 
returned to eat and talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he 
went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change. 

Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and 
all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds. As 
they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew 
more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they 
were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name 
among the sweet sad words that they could not understand. 

Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang the Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For so they 
loved to call him. But if Legolas was with the Company, he would not 
interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for 
him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song. 

It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words. 




He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Ri vendell he had 
listened 

and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that 
others had made before him. But now as he sat beside the fountain in Lurien 
and heard about him the voices of the Elves, his thought took shape in a 
song that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only 
snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered leaves. 

When evening in the Shire was grey 
his footsteps on the Hill were heard; 
before the dawn he went away 
on journey long without a word. 

From Wilderland to Western shore, 
from northern waste to southern hill, 
through dragon-lair and hidden door 
and darkling woods he walked at will. 

With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men, 
with mortal and immortal folk, 
with bird on bough and beast in den, 
in their own secret tongues he spoke. 

A deadly sword, a healing hand, 
a back that bent beneath its load; 
a trumpet-voice, a burning brand, 
a weary pilgrim on the road. 

A lord of wisdom throned he sat, 
swift in anger, quick to laugh; 
an old man in a battered hat 
who leaned upon a thorny staff. 

He stood upon the bridge alone 
and Fire and Shadow both defied; 
his staff was broken on the stone, 
in Khazad-dym his wisdom died. 

'Why, you'll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! ' said Sam. 




'No, I am afraid not,' said Frodo. 'But that is the best I can do yet.' 

'Well, Mr. Frodo, if you do have another go, I hope you'll say a word 
about his fireworks,' said Sam. 'Something like this: 

The finest rockets ever seen: 
they burst in stars of blue and green, 
or after thunder golden showers 
came falling like a rain of flowers. 

Though that doesn't do them justice by a long road.' 

'No, I'll leave that to you, Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But-well. I 
can't talk of it any more. I can't bear to think of bringing the news to 
him.' 

One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight. 
Both of them felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting 
had fallen: he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave 
Lothlurien. 

'What do you think of Elves now, Sam? ’ he said. 'I asked you the same 
question once before-it seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more 
of them since then.' 

'I have indeed! ' said Sam. 'And I reckon there's Elves and Elves. 

They're all elvish enough, but they're not all the same. Now these folk 
aren't wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they 
seem to belong here, more even than Flobbits do in the Shire. Whether they've 
made the land, or the land's made them, it's hard to say, if you take my 
meaning. It's wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems to be going on, and 
nobody seems to want it to. If there's any magic about, it's right down 
deep, where I can't lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.' 

'You can see and feel it everywhere,' said Frodo. 

'Well,' said Sam, 'you can't see nobody working it. No fireworks like 
poor Gandalf used to show. I wonder we don't see nothing of the Lord and 
Lady in all these days. I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things, 
if she had a mind. I'd dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo! ' 

'I wouldn't,' said Frodo. 'I am content. And I don't miss Gandalf's 
fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.' 

'You're right,' said Sam. 'And don't think I'm finding fault. I've 
often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but 
I've never heard of a better land than this. It's like being at home and on 
a holiday at the same time, if you understand me. I don't want to leave. All 




the same, I'm beginning to feel that if we’ve got to go on, then we'd best 
get it over. 

'It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish, as my 
old gaffer used to say. And I don't reckon that these folk can do much more 
to help us, magic or no. It's when we leave this land that we shall miss 
Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.' 

'I am afraid that's only too true, Sam,' said Frodo. 'Yet I hope very 
much that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the Elves again.' 

Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words, 
the Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall and white and fair she walked beneath 
the trees. She spoke no word, but beckoned to them. 

Turning aside, she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of 
Caras Galadhon, and passing through a high green hedge they came into an 
enclosed garden. No trees grew there, and it lay open to the sky. The 
evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western 
woods. Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into a deep green hollow, 
through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain 
on the hill. At the bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching 
tree, stood a basin of silver, wide and shallow, and beside it stood a 
silver ewer. 

With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and 
breathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke. 'Here is the 
Mirror of Galadriel,’ she said. ’I have brought you here so that you may 
look in it, if you will.' 

The air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the Elf-lady beside 
him was tall and pale. 'What shall we look for, and what shall we see? ' 
asked Frodo, filled with awe. 

'Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,' she answered, 'and to 
some I can show what they desire to see. But the Mirror will also show 
things unbidden, and those are often stranger and more profitable than 
things which we wish to behold. What you will see, if you leave the Mirror 
free to work, I cannot tell. For it shows things that were, and things that 
are, things that yet may be. But which it is that he sees, even the wisest 
cannot always tell. Do you wish to look? ' 

Frodo did not answer. 

'And you? ’ she said, turning to Sam. 'For this is what your folk would 
call magic. I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; 




and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But 
this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you 
wished to see Elf-magic? ' 

'I did,' said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity. Til 
have a peep, Lady, if you're willing.’ 

'And I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home,' he said in an 
aside to Frodo. 'It seems a terrible long time that I've been away. But 
there, like as not I'll only see the stars, or something that I won't 
understand.' 

'Like as not,' said the Lady with a gentle laugh. 'But come, you shall 
look and see what you may. Do not touch the water! ’ 

Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. 

The water looked hard and dark. Stars were reflected in it. 

'There's only stars, as I thought,' he said. Then he gave a low gasp, 
for the stars went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the Mirror 
grew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the branches of trees 
were waving and tossing in the wind. But before Sam could make up his mind 
what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo 
with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed 
to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding 
stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, 
but what it was he did not know. Like a dream the vision shifted and went 
back, and he saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and 
he could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were 
falling, crashing to the ground. 

'Hi!' cried Sam in an outraged voice. 'There's that Ted Sandyman 
a-cutting down trees as he shouldn't. They didn't ought to be felled: it's 
that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater. I wish I could 
get at Ted, and I'd fell himV 

But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished, and a large 
red-brick building was being put up where it had stood. Lots of folk were 
busily at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed to 
cloud the surface of the Mirror. 

'There's some devilry at work in the Shire,' he said. 'Elrond knew what 
he was about when he wanted to send Mr. Merry back.' Then suddenly Sam 
gave 

a cry and sprang away. 'I can't stay here,' he said wildly. 'I must go home. 




They’ve dug up Bagshot Row, and there's the poor old gaffer going down the 
Hill with his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home! ’ 

’You cannot go home alone,’ said the Lady. ’You did not wish to go home 
without your master before you looked in the Mirror, and yet you knew that 
evil things might well be happening in the Shire. Remember that the Mirror 
shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be, 
unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent 
them. The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.’ 

Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. 'I wish I had 
never come here, and I don’t want to see no more magic,’ he said and fell 
silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. 

'No, I’ll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo, or not at all,’ he said. 

'But I hope I do get back some day. If what I’ve seen turns out true, 
somebody’s going to catch it hot! ’ 

'Do you now wish to look, Frodo? ’ said the Lady Galadriel. 'You did 
not wish to see Elf-magic and were content.’ 

'Do you advise me to look? ’ asked Frodo. 

’No,’ she said. 'I do not counsel you one way or the other. I am not a 
counsellor. You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or 
evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not. Seeing is both good and 
perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for 
the venture, or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will! ’ 

'I will look,’ said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over 
the dark water. At once the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land. 
Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A long grey road 
wound back out of sight. Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint 
and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached. 
Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf. He almost called 
aloud the wizard’s name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in 
grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its 
hand there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see no 
face, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and 
went out of the Mirror's view. Doubt came into Frodo's mind: was this a 
vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it 
Saruman? 

The vision now changed. Brief and small but very vivid he caught a 
glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered 




with disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows. 

Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that 
Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become 
involved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before 
but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose and raged in a great 
storm. Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of 
clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of 
the West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous city. Then a white 
fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but now 
it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing 
the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke as of fire and battle 
arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey 
mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It 
vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away. 

But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had 
opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black 
abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly 
all the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry 
out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself 
glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its 
pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing. 

Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew 
with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he 
himself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him-not yet, not 
unless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew 
heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. The 
Mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the 
water. He was slipping forward. 

'Do not touch the water!' said the Lady Galadriel softly. The vision 
faded, and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in 
the silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady. 

V I know what it was that you last saw,' she said; 'for that is also in 
my mind. Do not be afraid! But do not think that only by singing amid the 
trees, nor even by the slender arrows of elven-bows, is this land of 
Lothlurien maintained and defended against its Enemy. I say to you, Frodo, 
that even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or 
all of his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my 




thought. But still the door is closed! ' 

She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East 
in a gesture of rejection and denial. Edrendil, the Evening Star, most 
beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of 
the Elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring 
about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver 
light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Even-star had come down to 
rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed 
to him that he understood. 

'Yes,' she said, divining his thought, 'it is not permitted to speak of 
it, and Elrond could not do so. But it cannot be hidden from the 
Ring -bearer, and one who has seen the Eye. Verily it is in the land of 
Lurien upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the Three remains. This is 
Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper. 

'He suspects, but he does not know — not yet. Do you not see now 
wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom? For if you fail, 
then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is 
diminished, and Lothlurien will fade, and the tides of Time will sweep it 
away. We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and 
cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.' 

Frodo bent his head. 'And what do you wish? ' he said at last. 

'That what should be shall be,’ she answered. 'The love of the Elves 
for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and 
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will 
cast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him now. For the 
fate of Lothlurien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own 
task. Yet I could wish, were it of any avail, that the One Ring had never 
been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.’ 

'You are wise and fearless and fair, Lady Galadriel,' said Frodo. 'I 
will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it. It is too great a matter for 
me.’ 

Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. 'Wise the Lady Galadriel 
may be,' she said, 'yet here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently are 
you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to 
see with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask 
what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should 
the Great Ring come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my 




grasp. The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways, whether 
Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set 
to the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest? 

'And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place 
of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but 
beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the 
Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the 
Lightning ! 

Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair! ' 

She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a 
great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark. She stood 
before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond 
enduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light 
faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender 
elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad. 

'I pass the test,' she said. 'I will diminish, and go into the West and 
remain Galadriel.' 

They stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again. 

'Let us return! ' she said. 'In the morning you must depart for now we have 
chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.' 

'I would ask one thing before we go,' said Frodo, 'a thing which I 
often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am permitted to wear the One 
Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that 
wear them? ’ 

'You have not tried,’ she said. 'Only thrice have you set the Ring upon 
your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy 
you. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the 
measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need 
to 

become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet 
even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that 
which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought 
more clearly than many that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that 
holds the Seven and the Nine. And did you not see and recognize the ring 
upon my finger? Did you see my ring? ’ she asked turning again to Sam. 

'No, Lady,' he answered. 'To tell you the truth, I wondered what you 
were talking about. I saw a star through your finger. But if you'll pardon 




my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you'd take his Ring. 
You'd put things to rights. You'd stop them digging up the gaffer and 
turning him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.' 

'I would,' she said. 'That is how it would begin. But it would not stop 
with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!' 




Chapter 8 . Farewell to Lurien 



That night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn, 
and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn 
spoke of their departure. 

'Now is the time,' he said, 'when those who wish to continue the Quest 
must harden their hearts to leave this land. Those who no longer wish to go 
forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, none can 
be sure of peace. For we are come now to the edge of doom. Here those who 
wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world 
lie open again, or we summon them to the last need of Lurien. Then they may 
return to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in 
battle.’ 

There was a silence. 'They all resolved to go forward,’ said Galadriel 
looking in their eyes. 

'As for me,’ said Boromir, 'my way home lies onward and not back.’ 

'That is true,’ said Celeborn, 'but is all this Company going with you 
to Minas Tirith? ’ 

'We have not decided our course,’ said Aragorn. ’Beyond Lothlurien I do 
not know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had 
any clear purpose.’ 

'Maybe not,’ said Celeborn, 'yet when you leave this land, you can no 
longer forget the Great River. As some of you know well, it cannot be 
crossed by travellers with baggage between Lurien and Gondor, save by boat. 
And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held 
now by the Enemy? 

'On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this 
side, upon the west; but the straight road of the Quest lies east of the 
River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take? ’ 

'If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to 
Minas Tirith,’ answered Boromir. 'But I am not the leader of the Company.’ 
The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled. 

'I see that you do not yet know what to do,’ said Celeborn. 'It is not 
my part to choose for you; but I will help you as I may. There are some 




among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know the swift Forest 
River; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.' 

'And one Hobbit! ' cried Merry. 'Not all of us look on boats as wild 
horses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.' 

'That is well,’ said Celeborn. 'Then I will furnish your Company with 
boats. They must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are 
places where you will be forced to carry them. You will come to the rapids 
of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the 
River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils. Boats may 
make your journey less toilsome for awhile. Yet they will not give you 
counsel: in the end you must leave them and the River, and turn west-or 
east.’ 

Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats comforted him 
much, not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for 
some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, 
it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to 
plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still 
thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that 
he had survived made him think better of them. 

'All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon 
tomorrow,' said Celeborn. 'I will send my people to you in the morning to 
help you make ready for the journey. Now we will wish you all a fair night 
and untroubled sleep.' 

'Good night, my friends! ' said Galadriel. 'Sleep in peace! Do not 
trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight. Maybe the 
paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though 
you do not see them. Good night! ' 

The Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion. 
Legolas went with them, for this was to be their last night in Lothlurien, 
and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together. 

For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be 
best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring: but they came 
to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas 
Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy. 

They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the 
shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in 
his mind. 




His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with 
Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the 
message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last 
when 

the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the 
mastery. But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he 
knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to 
go with Boromir. And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to 
Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness? 

'I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said 
Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes 
fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling’s thoughts. At 
length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. 'If you 
wish only to destroy the Ring,’ he said, "then there is little use in war 
and weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish to 
destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is folly to go without 
force into his domain; and folly to throw away.' He paused suddenly, as if 
he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. 'It would be 
folly to throw lives away, I mean,' he ended. 'It is a choice between 
defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death. At 
least, that is how I see it.' 

Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir's glance, and he 
looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final 
words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said 
something like this at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction 
of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought 
and made no sign that he had heeded Boromir's words. And so their debate 
ended. Merry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The 
night 

was growing old. 

In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, 

Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts 
of food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly in the form of 
very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, 
and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and 
looked at it with a doubtful eye. 

'Cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and 




nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of 
the cake with relish. 

'No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing. 'You have eaten enough 
already for a long day’s march.’ 

'I thought it was only a kind of cram , such as the Dale-men make for 
journeys in the wild,’ said the Dwarf. 

'So it is,’ they answered. 'But we call it lembas or waybread, and it 
is more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant 
than cram, by all accounts.’ 

'Indeed it is,’ said Gimli. ’Why it is better than the honey-cakes of 
the Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings are the best 
bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes 
to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts! ’ 

’All the same, we bid you spare the food,’ they said. ’Eat little at a 
time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all 
else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are 
unbroken and left in their leaf- wrappings, as we have brought them. One will 
keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of 
the tall Men of Minas Tirith.’ 

The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes 
they had brought. For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made 
according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim 
wove. It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of 
twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or 
set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow 
fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars. Each cloak was 
fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver. 

'Are these magic cloaks? ’ asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder. 

'I do not know what you mean by that,’ answered the leader of the 
Elves. 'They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this 
land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and 
branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things 
under the twilight of Lurien that we love; for we put the thought of all 
that we love into all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and 
they will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are 
light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you will find 
them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you 




walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the 
Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have 
we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.' 

After their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the 
fountain. Their hearts were heavy; for it was a fair place, and it had 
become like home to them, though they could not count the days and nights 
that they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at the white 
water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass 
of the glade. Frodo greeted him with delight. 

'I have returned from the Northern Fences,' said the Elf, 'and I am 
sent now to be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and 
clouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled. There are noises in the 
deeps of the earth. If any of you had thought of returning northwards to 
your homes, you would not have been able to pass that way. But come! Your 
path now goes south.' 

As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in 
the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing. They 
themselves 

went silently. At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the 
hill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the 
white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves. Then 
they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a 
deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding through rolling 
woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and 
eastwards, towards the shores of the River. 

They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a 
high green wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the 
trees. Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden 
elanor that glinted in the sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue 
between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed 
glittering; on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters, 
deep and dark. On the further shores the woodlands still marched on 
southwards as far as the eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and 
bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lurien. 

On the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of 
the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white wood. By it were 
moored many boats and barges. Some were brightly painted, and shone with 




silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey. Three small 
grey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves 
stowed their goods. And they added also coils of rope, three to each boat. 
Slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the 
elven-cloaks. 

'What are these? ' asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the 
greensward. 

'Ropes indeed! ' answered an Elf from the boats. 'Never travel far 
without a rope! And one that is long and strong and light. Such are these. 
They may be a help in many needs.' 

'You don't need to tell me that! ' said Sam. I came without any and 
I've been worried ever since. But I was wondering what these were made of, 
knowing a bit about rope -making: it's in the family as you might say.' 

'They are made of hithlain,' said the Elf, 'but there is no time now to 
instruct you in the art of their making. Had we known that this craft 
delighted you, we could have taught you much. But now alas! unless you 
should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May it 
serve you well ! ' 

'Come! ' said Haldir. 'All is now ready for you. Enter the boats! But 
take care at first! ’ 

'Heed the words! ' said the other Elves. 'These boats are light-built, 
and they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink, 
lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise 
if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a 
landing-place, before you set off downstream.' 

The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in 
one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were 
Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In this last boat most 
of the goods and packs were stowed. The boats were moved and steered with 
short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready 
Aragorn led them on a trial up the Silverlode. The current was swift and 
they went forward slowly. Sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and 
looking back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on the water 
dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue, the 
trees drew down to the river's brink. Here and there golden leaves tossed 
and floated on the rippling stream. The air was very bright and still, and 
there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks. 




They turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly down 
the stream toward them, they saw a swan of great size. The water rippled on 
either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone 
like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its 
huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew 
nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved 
with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two elves clad in white steered 
it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind 
him stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her 
hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang. Sad and sweet was the 
sound of her voice in the cool clear air: 

I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew: 

Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew. 

Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea, 

And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree. 

Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone, 

In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion. 

There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years, 

While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears. 

O Lurien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day; 

The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away. 

O Lurien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore 
And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor. 

But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me, 

What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea? 

Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended 
her song and greeted them. 'We have come to bid you our last farewell,' she 
said, 'and to speed you with blessings from our land.’ 

'Though you have been our guests,’ said Celeborn, 'you have not yet 
eaten with us, and we bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between 
the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lurien.' 

The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and 
followed it. There in the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the 
parting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank little, heeding only the 
beauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible, 
nor filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later 
days Elves still at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision 




of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of 
Time. 

After they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke 
to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the 
woods beyond the Tongue. 

'As you go down the water,' he said, 'you will find that the trees will 
fail, and you will come to a barren country. There the River flows in stony 
vale amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall 
island of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its arms 
about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and 
smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it 
is called in your tongue. That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the 
stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by 
many 

mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this 
side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills 
of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over 
the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of 
Mordor. 

'Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well 
to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds 
the marshes. Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk 
becoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is 
now little known. But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this 
warning.' 

'Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,' said Boromir. 'But 
what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives' tales, such as we 
tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away 
that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of 
our realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it, to 
prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years. 

'I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed it 
northwards. When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by 
the skirts of the White Mountains, and crossed the Isen and the Grey flood 
into Northerland. A long and wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I 
reckoned it, and it took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at 
the fording of the Greyflood. After that journey, and the road I have 




trodden with this Company, I do not much doubt that I shall find a way 
through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.' 

'Then I need say no more,' said Celeborn. 'But do not despise the lore 
that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives 
keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.' 

Now Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her 
maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn. 

'Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,' she said. 'Drink, Lord 
of the Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad though night must follow 
noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.’ 

Then she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink 
and farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the 
grass, and chairs were set for her and for Celeborn. Her maidens stood 
silent about her, and a while she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke 
again. 

'We have drunk the cup of parting,' she said, 'and the shadows fall 
between us. But before you go, I have brought in my ship gifts which the 
Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlurien.' 

Then 

she called to each in turn. 

'Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your 
Company,' she said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made 
to fit his sword. It was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves 
wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven runes formed of many 
gems the name And®ril and the lineage of the sword. 

'The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or 
broken even in defeat,' she said. 'But is there aught else that you desire 
of me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, and it may be that 
we shall not meet again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no 
returning.’ 

And Aragorn answered: 'Lady, you know all my desire, and long held in 
keeping the only treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even 
if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.' 

'Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,' said Galadriel; 'for it was 
left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.’ Then 
she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a silver 
brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings; 




and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the 
leaves of spring. 'This stone I gave to Celebrnan my daughter, and she to 
hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. In this hour take the name 
that was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the house of Elendil! ’ 

Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and 
those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and 
kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen 
from his shoulders. 'For the gifts that you have given me I thank you,’ he 
said, 'O Lady of Lurien of whom were sprung Celebrnan and Arwen 
Evenstar. 

What praise could I say more? ' 

The Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boromir, and to him she 
gave a belt of gold; and to Merry and Pippin she gave small silver belts, 
each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas she gave a bow 
such as the Galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood, 
and strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows. 

'For you little gardener and lover of trees,' she said to Sam, 'I have 
only a small gift.’ She put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood, 
unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid. 'Here is set G for 
Galadriel,' she said; 'but also it may stand for garden in your tongue. In 
this box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as Galadriel has 
still to bestow is upon it. It will not keep you on your road, nor defend 
you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last, 
then perhaps it may reward you. Though you should find all barren and laid 
waste, there will be few gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your 
garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel, 
and catch a glimpse far off of Lurien, that you have seen only in our 
winter. For our spring and our summer are gone by, and they will never be 
seen on earth again save in memory.' 

Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he 
clutched the box and bowed as well as he could. 

'And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves? ' said Galadriel turning 
to Gimli. 

'None, Lady,’ answered Gimli. 'It is enough for me to have seen the 
Lady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.' 

'Hear all ye Elves! ’ she cried to those about her. 'Let none say again 
that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son of Gluin, 




you desire something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be 
the only guest without a gift.' 

'There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,' said Gimli, bowing low and 
stammering. 'Nothing, unless it might be-unless it is permitted to ask. nay, 
to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth 
as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But 
you commanded me to name my desire.’ 

The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at 
the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. ’It is said that the skill of the 
Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues ’ she said; 'yet that 
is not true of Gimli. For none have ever made to me a request so bold and 
yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak? 
But tell me, what would you do with such a gift? ’ 

'Treasure it, Lady,’ he answered, 'in memory of your words to me at our 
first meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be 
set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of 
good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.’ 

Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three 
golden hairs, and laid them in Gimli’s hand. 'These words shall go with the 
gift,’ she said. 'I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the 
one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. But if hope should not 
fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Gluin, that your hands shall flow with 
gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion. 

'And you, Ring-bearer,’ she said, turning to Frodo. 'I come to you last 
who are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared this.’ She held up 
a small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light 
sprang from her hand. ’In this phial,’ she said, 'is caught the light of 
Edrendil’s star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still 
brighter when night is about you. May it be a light to you in dark places, 
when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel and her Mirror! ’ 

Frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw 
her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer 
terrible. He bowed, but found no words to say. 

Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe. A yellow 
noon lay on the green land of the Tongue, and the water glittered with 
silver. All at last was made ready. The Company took their places in the 
boats as before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lurien with long grey poles 




thrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters bore them 
slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving or speaking. On the 
green bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood 
alone and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her 
slowly floating away from them. For so it seemed to them: Lurien was 
slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing 
on to forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey 
and leafless world. 

Even as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the 
Great River, and their boats turned and began to speed southwards. Soon the 
white form of the Lady was small and distant. She shone like a window of 
glass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a 
mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then it seemed to Frodo 
that she lifted her arms in a final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on 
the following wind came the sound of her voice singing. But now she sang in 
the ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea, and he did not understand 
the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him. 

Yet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained graven in his memory, 
and long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could: the language 
was that of Elven-song and spoke of things little known on Middle-earth.

Nambril! Nai hiruvalyl Valimar. 

Nai elyl hiruva. Nambril! 

'Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as 
the wings of trees ! The long years have passed like swift draughts of the 
sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West, beneath the blue vaults of Varda 
wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice, holy and queenly. Who 
now shall refill the cup for me? For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of 
the Stars, from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all 
paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country darkness lies on 
the foaming waves between us, and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for 
ever. Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou 
shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell! ' Varda is the 
name of that Fady whom the Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth. 

Suddenly the River swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon either 
side, and the light of Furien was hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came 
again. 

The travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was 
before them, and their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. 

Gimli wept openly. 

'I have looked the last upon that which was fairest,' he said to 
Fegolas his companion. 'Henceforward I will call nothing fair, unless it be 
her gift.' He put his hand to his breast. 

'Tell me, Fegolas, why did I come on this Quest? Tittle did I know 
where the chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not 
foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger 
that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I 
known the danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this 
parting, even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Ford. Alas for 
Gimli son of Gluin! ’ 

'Nay! ’ said Fegolas. 'Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world 
in these after-days. For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it 
seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed, 
Gimli son of Gluin: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you 
might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions, 
and 

the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Fothlurien shall 
remain ever clear and unstained in your heart, and shall neither fade nor 




grow stale.' 

'Maybe,' said Gimli; 'and I thank you for your words. True words 
doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart 
desires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheled-zvram. Or so says the 
heart of Gimli the Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I have 
heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream. 
Not so for Dwarves. 

'But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in the 
water with all this baggage, and the Great River is swift. I do not wish to 
drown my grief in cold water.' He took up a paddle, and steered towards the 
western bank, following Aragorn's boat ahead, which had already moved out of 
the middle stream. 

So the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters, 
borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could 
not see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze died away and the River 
flowed without a sound. No voice of bird broke the silence. The sun grew 
misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white 
pearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came early, followed by a grey 
and starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding 
their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods. Great trees 
passed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the 
mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and listened to 
the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the tree-roots and 
driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy 
sleep. 




Chapter 9 . The Great River 



Frodo was roused by Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped, 
under tall grey -skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west 
bank of the Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night away, and the grey 
of morning was dim among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire 
near at hand. 

They started again before the day was broad. Not that most of the 
Company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision, 
which they must make at latest when they came to Rauros and the Tindrock 
Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the River bear them on at its 
own pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond, 
whichever course they took in the end. Aragorn let them drift with the 
stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness to come. 
But he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey 
on far into the evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, 
and he feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in 
Lurien. 

Nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day, nor the next. The 
dull grey hours passed without event. As the third day of their voyage wore 
on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether. 

On the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching 
up and away toward the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had 
passed over them, leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste 
without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness. They 
had come to the Brown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern 
Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence or war or evil deed 
of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell. 

Upon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was 
flat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass. On this side of 
the River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all 
view to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along their 
fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light 
cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and there through openings Frodo 
could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far beyond them hills in 




the sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where marched the 
southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains. 

There was no sign of living moving things, save birds. Of these there 
were many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds, but they were 
seldom seen. Once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of 
swan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky. 
'Swans! ' said Sam. 'And mighty big ones too! ’ 

'Yes,' said Aragorn, ’and they are black swans.' 

'How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks! ’ said Frodo. 

'I always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier, 
until winter was left behind for ever.’ 

’But we have not journeyed far south yet,’ answered Aragorn. 'It is 
still winter, and we are far from the sea. Here the world is cold until the 
sudden spring, and we may yet have snow again. Far away down in the Bay of 
Belfalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but 
for the Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, I guess, south of 
the Southfarthing away in your Shire, hundreds of long miles yonder. You are 
looking now south-west across the north plains of the Riddermark, Rohan the 
land of the Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight 
that runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River. That is the north 
boundary of Rohan; and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White 
Mountains belonged to the Rohirrim. It is a rich and pleasant land, and its 
grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or 
ride often to its shores. Anduin is wide, yet the ores can shoot their 
arrows far across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have dared to 
cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan.’ 

Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile 
before, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished 
that the trees were still there. He felt that the Company was too naked, 
afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, and on a 
river that was the frontier of war. 

In the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, 
this feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company. For a whole day they 
took to their paddles and hastened forward. The banks slid by. Soon the 
River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east, 
and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was 
needed. The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air 




from the East. On the other side the meads had become rolling downs of 
withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of 
the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlurien. There 
was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats. Each member of the 
Company was busy with his own thoughts. 

The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in 
some northern glade amid the beech- woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his 
mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the 
Lady's gift. Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for 
Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some 
restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving 
the boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking 
back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. 
Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as 
dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more 
uncomfortable than even he had imagined. Fie was cramped and miserable, 
having nothing to do but stare at the winter -lands crawling by and the grey 
water on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in use they did not 
trust Sam with one. 

As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed 
heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and 
longed 

for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his 
sight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his 
eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more. 

That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank. Sam 
lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo. V I had a funny dream an hour or two 
before we stopped, Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'Or maybe it wasn't a dream. Funny 
it was anyway.' 

'Well, what was it? ' said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle 
down until he had told his tale, whatever it was. 'I haven't seen or thought 
of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlurien.' 

'It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if it 
wasn't a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with 
eyes! ' 

'The log's all right,' said Frodo. 'There are many in the River. But 
leave out the eyes ! ’ 




'That I won't,' said Sam. ' 'Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to 
speak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind 
Gimli's boat; but I didn't give much heed to it. Then it seemed as if the 
log was slowly catching us up. And that was peculiar, as you might say, 
seeing as we were all floating on the stream together. Just then I saw the 
eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny -like, on a hump at the near end of the 
log. What's more, it wasn't a log, for it had paddle-feet, like a swan's 
almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water. 

'That's when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a 
shout, if it was still there when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head. 

For the whatever -it-was was coming along fast now and getting close behind 
Gimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or whether 
I came to my senses, I don't know. When I looked again, it wasn't there. Yet 
I think I caught a glimpse with the tail of-my eye, as the saying is, of 
something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank. I couldn't see no more 
eyes though. 

'I said to myself: "dreaming again, Sam Gamgee," I said: and I said no 
more just then. But I've been thinking since, and now I'm not so sure. What 
do you make of it, Mr. Frodo? ' 

'I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your 
eyes Sam, said Frodo, if this was the first time that those eyes had been 
seen. But it isn't. I saw them away back north before we reached Lurien. And 
I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night. Haldir 
saw it too. And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after the 
ore-band? ' 

'Ah,' said Sam. 'I do; and I remember more too. I don't like my 
thoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and Mr. Bilbo's stories and 
all, I fancy I could put a name on the creature, at a guess. A nasty name. 
Gollum, maybe? ' 

'Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,' said Frodo. 'Ever 
since the night on the flet. I suppose he was lurking in Moria, and picked 
up our trail then; but I hoped that our stay in Lurien would throw him off 
the scent again. The miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods 
by the Silverlode, watching us start off! ’ 

'That's about it,' said Sam. 'And we'd better be a bit more watchful 
ourselves, or we'll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these 
nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. And that's what I was leading 




up to. No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight. I'll keep watch. I 
can sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.' 

V I might,' said Frodo, 'and I might say "luggage with eyes". You shall 
watch; but only if you promise to wake me halfway towards morning, if 
nothing happens before then.' 

In the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam 
shaking him. 'It's a shame to wake you,' whispered Sam, 'but that's what you 
said. There's nothing to tell, or not much. I thought I heard some soft 
plashing and a sniffing noise, a while back; but you hear a lot of such 
queer sounds by a river at night.' 

He lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off 
his sleep. Minutes or hours passed slowly, and nothing happened. Frodo was 
just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly 
visible, floated close to one of the moored boats. A long whitish hand could 
be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes 
shone coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at 
Frodo on the eyot. They were not more than a yard or two away, and Frodo 
heard the soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its 
sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut off. There was 
another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream into 
the night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up' 

'What is it? ' he whispered, springing up and coming to Frodo. 'I felt 
something in my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword? ' 

'Gollum,' answered Frodo. 'Or at least, so I guess.' 

'Ah! ' said Aragorn. 'So you know about our little footpad, do you? He 
padded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel. Since we took 
to boats, he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet. I 
have tried to catch him once or twice at night; but he is slier than a fox, 
and as slippery as a fish. I hoped the river-voyage would beat him, but he 
is too clever a waterman. 

'We shall have to try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now, and I 
will keep watch for what is left of the night. I wish I could lay my hands 
on the wretch. We might make him useful. But if I cannot, we shall have to 
try and lose him. He is very dangerous. Quite apart from murder by night on 
his own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track.' 

The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again. 
After that the Company kept a sharp look-out, but they saw no more of Gollum 




while the voyage lasted. If he was still following, he was very wary and 
cunning. At Aragorn’s bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the 
banks went swiftly by. But they saw little of the country, for they 
journeyed mostly by night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden 
as the land allowed. In this way the time passed without event until the 
seventh day. 

The weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the East, but 
as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint 
light, yellow and pale green, opened under the grey shores of cloud. There 
the white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes. 
Sam looked at it and puckered his brows. 

The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly. The 
banks began to rise and grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly 
rocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes 
of thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers. Behind them stood low 
crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and 
beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. 
They were drawing near to the grey hill -country of the Emyn Muil, the 
southern march of Wilderland. 

There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and all 
day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling, black against the 
pale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights 
doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news 
of 

their voyage was now moving in the wilderness. Later as the sun was setting, 
and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a 
dark spot against the fading light: a great bird high and far off, now 
wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards. 

’What is that, Legolas? ' he asked, pointing to the northern sky. 'Is 
it, as I think, an eagle? ' 

’Yes.' said Legolas. 'It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what 
that forebodes. It is far from the mountains.' 

'We will not start until it is fully dark,' said Aragorn. 

The eighth night of their journey came. It was silent and windless; the 
grey east wind had passed away. The thin crescent of the Moon had fallen 
early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away 
in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly, in 




the West stars glinted bright. 

'Come! ' said Aragorn. 'We will venture one more journey by night. We 
are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well: for I have never 
journeyed by water in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of 
Sarn Gebir. But if I am right in my reckoning, those are still many miles 
ahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and 
stony eyots in the stream. We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle 
swiftly.’ 

To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman. He lay 
forward peering into the gloom. The night grew dark, but the stars above 
were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer On the face of the River. It 
was close on midnight, and they had been drifting for some while, hardly 
using the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out. Only a few yards ahead dark 
shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water. There 
was a swift current which swung left, towards the eastern shore where the 
channel was clear. As they were swept aside the travellers could see, now 
very close, the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were 
thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth. The boats were all 
huddled together. 

'Hoy there, Aragorn! ’ shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped into the 
leader. 'This is madness! We cannot dare the Rapids by night! But no boat 
can live in Sarn Gebir, be it night or day.’ 

'Back, back! ’ cried Aragorn. Turn! Turn if you can! ’ He drove his 
paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring it round. 

’I am out of my reckoning,’ he said to Frodo. ’I did not know that we 
had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought. Sarn Gebir must be 
close at hand already.’ 

With great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them 
about; but at first they could make only small headway against the current, 
and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank. 

Now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night. 

’All together, paddle! ’ shouted Boromir. ’Paddle! Or we shall be 
driven on the shoals.’ Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath him 
grate upon stone. 

At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled 
over them, and some fell among them. One smote Frodo between the 
shoulders 




and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell 
back, foiled by his hidden coat of mail. Another passed through Aragorn's 
hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat, close by 
Merry's hand. Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro 
upon the long shingle -banks that lay under the eastern shore. They seemed 
very near. 

' Yrch !' said Legolas, falling into his own tongue. 

'Ores! ' cried Gimli. 

'Gollum's doing, I'll be bound.' said Sam to Frodo. 'And a nice place 
to choose, too. The River seems set on taking us right into their arms! ' 

They all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a hand. 
Every moment they expected to feel the bite of black -feathered arrows. Many 
whined overhead or struck the water nearby; but there were no more hits. It 
was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of Ores, and in the 
star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless it 
was that the grey cloaks Of Lurien and the grey timber of the elf- wrought 
boats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor. 

Stroke by stroke they laboured on. In the darkness it was hard to be 
sure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water 
grew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night. At 
last, as far as they could judge, they had reached the middle of the stream 
again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks. 
Then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the 
western shore. Under the shadow Of bushes leaning out over the water they 
halted and drew breath. 

Legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought 
from Lurien. Then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank. 
Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over the 
River into the darkness. Across the water there were shrill cries, but 
nothing could be seen. 

Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into 
the night, seeking a mark to shoot at. His head was dark, crowned with sharp 
white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind. But now 
rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced, sending out 
dark outriders into the starry fields. A sudden dread fell on the Company. 

' Elbereth Gilthoniel!' sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he did 
so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more 




swiftly, came out of the blackness in the South, and sped towards the 
Company, blotting out all light as it approached. Soon it appeared as a 
great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. Fierce voices 
rose up to greet it from across the water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running 
through him and clutching at his heart; there was a deadly cold, like the 
memory of an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if to hide. 

Suddenly the great bow of Lurien sang. Shrill went the arrow from the 
elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost above him the winged shape swerved. 
There was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down 
into the gloom of the eastern shore. The sky was clean again. There was a 
tumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness, and 
then silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night. 

After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They felt their way 
along the water’s edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow 
bay. A few low trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a 
steep rocky bank. Here the Company decided to stay and await the dawn: it 
was useless to attempt to move further by night. They made no camp and lit 
no fire, but lay huddled in the boats, moored close together. 

’Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas ! ’ 
said Gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas. 'That was a mighty shot in the 
dark, my friend!' 

'But who can say what it hit?' said Legolas. 

'I cannot,' said Gimli. 'But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer. 

I liked it not at all. Too much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria — the 
shadow of the Balrog,' he ended in a whisper. 

'It was not a Balrog,' said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that 
had come upon him. 'It was something colder. I think it was — ' Then he 
paused and fell silent. 

'What do you think? ' asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as 
if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo's face. 

'I think — No, I will not say,' answered Frodo. 'Whatever it was, its 
fall has dismayed our enemies.' 

'So it seems,' said Aragorn. 'Yet where they are, and how many, and 
what they will do next, we do not know. This night we must all be sleepless! 
Dark hides us now. But what the day will show who can tell? Have your 
weapons close to hand! ' 

Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his 




fingers, and looking up at the sky. "It's very strange,' he murmured. 'The 
Moon's the same in the Shire and in Wilderland, or it ought to be. But 
either it's out of its running, or I'm all wrong in my reckoning. You'll 
remember, Mr. Frodo, the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that 
tree: a week from the full, I reckon. And we'd been a week on the way last 
night, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail-paring, as if we had never 
stayed no time in the Elvish country. 

'Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, and I seem to 
remember several more, but I would take my oath it was never a whole month. 
Anyone would think that time did not count in there! ’ 

'And perhaps that was the way of it,’ said Frodo. 'In that land, maybe, 
we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by. It was not, I think, 
until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned to the time that 
flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea. And I don't remember any moon, 
either new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.' 

Legolas stirred in his boat. 'Nay, time does not tarry ever,' he said; 

'but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the Elves 
the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because 
they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to 
them. Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves. 
The passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream. 

Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last.’ 

'But the wearing is slow in Lurien,' said Frodo. 'The power of the Lady 
is on it. Rich are the hours, though short they seem, in Caras Galadhon, 
where Galadriel wields the Elven-ring.’ 

'That should not have been said outside Lurien, not even to me,' said 
Aragorn. 'Speak no more of it! But so it is, Sam: in that land you lost your 
count. There time flowed swiftly by us, as for the Elves. The old moon 
passed, and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside, while we 
tarried there. And yestereve a new moon came again. Winter is nearly gone. 
Time flows on to a spring of little hope.’ 

The night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again across the 
water. The travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the 
weather. The air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that 
had floated up from the South and the distant seas. The rushing of the River 
over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer. The twigs of 
the trees above them began to drip. 




When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and 
sad. Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light, diffused and shadowless. There 
was mist on the River, and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could 
not be seen. 

'I can't abide fog,' said Sam; 'but this seems to be a lucky one. Now 
perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us.' 

'Perhaps so,' said Aragorn. 'But it will be hard to find the path 
unless the fog lifts a little later on. And we must find the path, if we are 
to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.' 

'I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any 
further,' said Boromir. 'If the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon 
these cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward, until we come to the 
Entwash and cross into my own land.’ 

'We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, 'but that is 
not yet agreed. And such a course may be more perilous than it sounds. The 
vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those 
on foot and laden. I would not abandon our boats until we must. The River is 
at least a path that cannot be missed.' 

'But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,' objected Boromir. 'And even if 
you pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested to the Tindrock, what 
will you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes? ’ 

'No! ' answered Aragorn. 'Say rather that we will bear our boats by the 
ancient way to Rauros-foot, and there take to the water again. Do you not 
know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North Stair, and the high seat 
upon Amon Hen, that were made in the days of the great kings? I at least 
have a mind to stand in that high place again, before I decide my further 
course. There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.' 

Boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain 
that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in. 'It is not 
the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their friends at need,' he 
said, 'and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock. 

To the tall isle I will go, but no further. There I shall turn to my home, 
alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship.’ 

The day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. It was 
decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the shore, 
while the others remained by the boats. Aragorn hoped to find some way by 
which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother 




water beyond the Rapids. 

'Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,’ he said, 'but that does not 
say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive. None have ever done so 
yet. No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region, for even in their 
great days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil; but 
there is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore, if I can find it. It 
cannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland 
down to Osgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the Ores of 
Mordor began to multiply.’ 

’Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North, and the Ores 
prowl on the east-shore,’ said Boromir. 'If you go forward, peril will grow 
with every mile, even if you find a path.’ 

'Peril lies ahead on every southward road,’ answered Aragorn. 'Wait for 
us one day. If we do not return in that time, you will know that evil has 
indeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader and follow him as best 
you can.’ 

It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the 
steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless. Only 
two or three hours had passed, and it was barely mid-day, when the shadowy 
shapes of the explorers appeared again. 

'All is well,’ said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. ’There is a 
track, and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable. The 
distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us, 
and they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them the stream 
becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. Our hardest task 
will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage- way. We have found 
it, but it lies well back from the water-side here, and runs under the lee 
of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the 
northward landing lies. If it still remains, we must have passed it 
yesterday night. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog. I 
fear we must leave the River now, and make for the portage-way as best we 
can from here.’ 

'That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,’ said Boromir. 

'Yet such as we are we will try it,’ said Aragorn. 

’Aye, we will,’ said Gimli. 'The legs of Men will lag on a rough road, 
while a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir! ’ 

The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were 




taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a 
level space. Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. They 
were far less heavy than any had expected. Of what tree growing in the 
elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was 
tough 

and yet strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with 
ease along the flat. Nonetheless it needed the strength of the two Men to 
lift and haul them over the ground that the Company now had to cross. It 
sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders, 
with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were thickets 
of brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters 
trickling from the terraces further inland. 

One by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats, while the others 
toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage. At last all was removed 
and laid on the portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from 
sprawling briars and many fallen stones, they moved forward all together. 
Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist 
shrouded the River: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp 
shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not see it. Twice they 
made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing. 

There the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down 
to the shallow edge of a little pool. It seemed to have been scooped in the 
river-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling down from Sarn Gebir 
against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond 
it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff, and there was no further passage 
for those on foot. 

Already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing 
in. They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the 
Rapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were 
as gloomy as the dying day. 

'Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,' said Boromir. 

'We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath 
by night, we are all too tired-except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.' 

Gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat. 

'Let us rest as much as we can now,' said Aragorn. 'Tomorrow we must 
journey by day again. Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we 
shall have a good chance of slipping through, unseen by any eyes on the 




eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off 
and one on guard.' 

Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour 
before dawn. As soon as it was fully light they started. Already the fog was 
thinning. They kept as close as they could to the western side, and they 
could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls 
with their feet in the hurrying river. In the mid-morning the clouds drew 
down lower, and it began to rain heavily. They drew the skin -covers over 
their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on: little could 
be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains. 

The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew 
lighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled fringes 
trailed away northward up the River. The fogs and mists were gone. Before 
the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which clung, 
upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew 
narrower and the River swifter. Now they were speeding along with little 
hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a 
lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed River, and before 
them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no 
opening could be seen. 

Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching: 
like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed. Tall and sheer and 
ominous they stood upon either side of the stream. A narrow gap appeared 
between them, and the River swept the boats towards it. 

'Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings! ' cried Aragorn. 'We 
shall pass them soon. Keep the boats in line, and as far apart as you can! 

Hold the middle of the stream! ’ 

As Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to 
meet him. Giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures silent but 
threatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned: the 
craft and power of old had wrought upon them, and still they preserved 
through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which 
they had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood 
two great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they 
frowned upon the North. The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in 
gesture of warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head 
there was a crumbling helm and crown. Great power and majesty they still 




wore, the silent wardens of a long -vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon 
Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as 
the boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by. 
frail and fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring shadow of the 
sentinels of N®menor. So they passed into the dark chasm of the Gates. 

Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side. Far 
off was the dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed 
over them. Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering and 
groaning: 'What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me get out of this 
boat, and I'll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river! ' 

'Fear not!' said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned and saw 
Strider, and yet not Strider; for the weatherworn Ranger was no longer 
there. In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud and erect, guiding 
the boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, and his dark hair was 
blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes: a king returning from exile to 
his own land. 

’Fear not! ' he said. 'Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses 
of Isildur and Anbrion, my sires of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the 
Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildur’s son heir of 
Elendil, has nought to dread! ’ 

Then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: 'Would that 
Gandalf were here! How my heart yearns for Minas Anor and the walls of my 
own city! But whither now shall I go? ’ 

The chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind and 
rushing water and echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards the west so that 
at first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before 
him, ever growing. Swiftly it drew near, and suddenly the boats shot 
through, out into a wide clear light. 

The sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. 

The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced 
by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were 
bare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight. At the far southern end rose three 
peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered 
from 

them, an island in the waters, about which the flowing River flung pale 
shimmering arms. Distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound 
like the roll of thunder heard far away. 




'Behold Tol Brandir! ' said Aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak. 

'Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of 
Hearing and of Sight. In the days of the great kings there were high seats 
upon them, and watch was kept there. But it is said that no foot of man or 
beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere the shade of night falls we 
shall come to them. I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling.' 

The Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current that 
flowed through the middle of the lake. They ate some food, and then they 
took to their paddles and hastened on their way. The sides of the westward 
hills fell into shadow, and the Sun grew round and red. Here and there a 
misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling in the 
twilight. Rauros was roaring with a great voice. Already night was laid on 
the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the 
hills. 

The tenth day of their journey was over. Wilderland was behind them. 
They could go no further without choice between the east-way and the west. 
The last stage of the Quest was before them. 




Chapter 10. The Breaking of the Fellowship 



Aragorn led them to the right arm of the River. Here upon its western 
side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from 
the feet of Amon Hen. Behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill 
clad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of 
the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass. 

'Here we will rest tonight,' said Aragorn. 'This is the lawn of Parth 
Galen: a fair place in the summer days of old. Let us hope that no evil has 
yet come here.' 

They drew up their boats on the green banks, and beside them they made 
their camp. They set a watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies. 

If Gollum had contrived to follow them, he remained unseen and unheard. 
Nonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in his 
sleep and waking. In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn 
it was to watch. 

'Why are you waking? ' asked Frodo. 'It is not your watch.' 

'I do not know,’ answered Aragorn; 'but a shadow and a threat has been 
growing in my sleep. It would be well to draw your sword.' 

'Why? ’ said Frodo. 'Are enemies at hand? ’ 

'Let us see what Sting may show,' answered Aragorn. 

Frodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges 
gleamed dimly in the night. 'Ores! ’ he said. 'Not very near, and yet too 
near, it seems.’ 

'I feared as much,' said Aragorn. 'But maybe they are not on this side 
of the River. The light of Sting is faint, and it may point to no more than 
spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw. I have never heard 
before of Ores upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows what may happen in these 
evil 

days, now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of Anduin. 
We must go warily tomorrow.’ 

The day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars 
of cloud like the fumes of a great burning. The rising sun lit them from 
beneath with flames of murky red; but soon it climbed above them into a 
clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold. Frodo looked out 




eastward and gazed at the tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out of the 
running water. High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which 
trees climbed, mounting one head above another; and above them again were 
grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of stone. Many 
birds were circling about it, but no sign of other living things could be 
seen. 

When they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. 'The day has 
come at last,' he said: 'the day of choice which we have long delayed. What 
shall now become of our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship? 
Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor; or turn east 
to the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and 
that as each may choose? Whatever we do must be done soon. We cannot 
long 

halt here. The enemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but I fear that the 
Ores may already be on this side of the water.' 

There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved. 

'Well, Frodo,' said Aragorn at last. 'I fear that the burden is laid 
upon you. You are the Bearer appointed by the Council. Your own way you 
alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, and 
though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he 
had for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most likely it seems that if he 
were here now the choice would still wait on you. Such is your fate.' 

Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. 'I know that haste 
is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden is heavy. Give me an hour longer, 
and I will speak. Let me be alone! ’ 

Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. 'Very well, Frodo son of 
Drogo,' he said. 'You shall have an hour, and you shall be alone. We will 
stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.’ 

Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been watching 
his master with great concern, shook his head and muttered: 'Plain as a 
pikestaff it is, but it's no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.' 

Presently Frodo got up and walked away; and Sam saw that while the 
others restrained themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes of Boromir 
followed Frodo intently, until he passed out of sight in the trees at the 
foot of Amon Hen. 

Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his feet 




were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the 
dwindling ruins of a road of long ago. In steep places stairs of stone had 
been hewn, but now they were cracked and worn, and split by the roots of 
trees. For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he 
came to a grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about it, and in the midst was a 
wide flat stone. The little upland lawn was open upon the East and was 
filled now with the early sunlight. Frodo halted and looked out over the 
River, far below him, to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great 
gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle. The voice of Rauros was a 
mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom. 

He sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands, staring 
eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo 
left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered 
everything that he could remember of Gandalf s words. Time went on, and 
still he was no nearer to a choice. 

Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that 
something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him. He sprang up 
and turned; but all that he saw to his surprise was Boromir, and his face 
was smiling and kind. 

'I was afraid for you, Frodo,' he said, coming forward. 'If Aragorn is 
right and Ores are near, then none of us should wander alone, and you least 
of all: so much depends on you. And my heart too is heavy. May I stay now 
and talk for a while, since I have found you? It would comfort me. Where 
there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together 
may perhaps find wisdom.' 

'You are kind,' answered Frodo. 'But I do not think that any speech 
will help me. For I know what I should do, but I am afraid of doing it, 
Boromir: afraid.' 

Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in 
the branches of the trees. Frodo shivered. 

Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. 'Are you sure that you do not 
suffer needlessly? ’ he said. 'I wish to help you. You need counsel in your 
hard choice. Will you not take mine? ’ 

’I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,' said 
Frodo. 'And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.' 

'Warning? Warning against what? ' said Boromir sharply. 

'Against delay. Against the way that seems easier. Against refusal of 




the burden that is laid on me. Against -well, if it must be said, against 
trust in the strength and truth of Men.' 

'Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little 
country, though you knew it not.' 

'I do not doubt the valour of your people. But the world is changing. 

The walls of Minas Tirith may be strong, but they are not strong enough. If 
they fail, what then? ' 

'We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they 
will not fail.' 

'No hope while the Ring lasts,' said Frodo. 

'Ah! The Ring! ' said Boromir, his eyes lighting. 'The Ring! Is it not 
a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a 
thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an instant in the House 
of Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again? ' 

Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the strange 
gleam in Boromir's eyes, yet his face was still kind and friendly. 'It is 
best that it should lie hidden,' he answered. 

'As you wish. I care not,' said Boromir. 'Yet may I not even speak of 
it? For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy: 
of its evil uses not of its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas 
Tirith will fall, if the Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if the Ring were 
with the Enemy. But why, if it were with us? ' 

'Were you not at the Council? ' answered Frodo. 'Because we cannot use 
it, and what is done with it turns to evil.’ 

Boromir got up and walked about impatiently. 'So you go on,' he cried. 
'Gandalf, Elrond — all these folk have taught you to say so. For themselves 
they may be right. These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come 
to grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. 

But each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We 
of Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial. We do not 
desire the power of wizard-lords, only strength to defend ourselves, 
strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the 
-Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad 
not to use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the 
ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior do in 
this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why 




not Boromir? The Ring would give me power of Command. How I would 
drive the 

hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!' 

Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed 
to have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the 
mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious 
victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty king, 
benevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms. 

'And they tell us to throw it away!' he cried. 'I do not say destroy 
it. That might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so. It does 
not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk 
blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for 
himself. Folly! 

'Surely you see it, my friend?' he said, turning now suddenly to Frodo 
again. 'You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should pardon 
you. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?' 

'No, I am afraid,' said Frodo. 'Simply afraid. But I am glad to have 
heard you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.' 

'Then you will come to Minas Tirith? ' cried Boromir. His eyes were 
shining and his face eager. 

'You misunderstand me,’ said Frodo. 

'But you will come, at least for a while? ' Boromir persisted. 'My city 
is not far now; and it is little further from there to Mordor than from 
here. We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the 
Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,' he said. 
'You 

need rest before your venture, if go you must.’ He laid his hand on the 
hobbit's shoulder in friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling 
with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the 
tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength. 

'Why are you so unfriendly? ’ said Boromir. 'I am a true man, neither 
thief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now; but I give you my 
word that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not at least let me make 
trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring! ’ 

'No! no! ' cried Frodo. 'The Council laid it upon me to bear it.' 

'It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us,’ cried Boromir. 

'How it angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully to death and 




mining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the Ring, it is the men of 
N®menor, and not Halflings. It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It might 
have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me ! ' 

Frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood 
between them. 'Come, come, my friend! ' said Boromir in a softer voice. 'Why 
not get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the 
blame on me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong and took it by 
force. For I am too strong for you, halfling,' he cried; and suddenly he 
sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was 
hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes. 

Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only 
one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and 
quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The 
Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking 
here and there among the rocks and trees. 

'Miserable trickster!' he shouted. 'Let me get my hands on you! Now I 
see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all. You have 
only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse you and all 
halflings to death and darkness ! ' Then, catching his foot on a stone, he 
fell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his 
own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept. 

He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. 

'What have I said? ' he cried. 'What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! ' he called. 
'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back! ' 

There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already 
far away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror and grief 
shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir, and his 
burning eyes. 

Soon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted, gasping 
for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty 
flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set 
upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. 

Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that 
had clambered upon the throne of mountain -kings. 

At first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in 
which there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here and there 
the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were 




under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright 
living images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was 
sitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men 
of N®menor. Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, 
and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay like a 
ribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken 
teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, 
the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below 
his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over 
the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the 
fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of 
sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green 
and silver sea, rippling in endless lines. 

But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains 
were crawling like anthills: ores were issuing out of a thousand holes. 

Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and 
fell beasts. The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; 
smoke rose on the borders of Lurien. 

Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from 
Isengard. From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of 
the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon 
horses, 

chariots of chieftains and laden wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was 
in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it 
seemed, and beautiful: white-walled, many -towered, proud and fair upon its 
mountain- seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were 
bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith 
was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward, 
unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the 
grinning gates of Minas Morgul. and the haunted Mountains, and it looked 
upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor. Darkness lay 
there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, 
and 

a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, 
battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, 
gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dyr, Fortress of Sauron. 

All hope left him. 




And suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that 
did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager 
will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, 
searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where 
he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself 
from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood. 

He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I come, I 
come to you ? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of 
power there came to his mind another thought: Take it off! Take it off! 

Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring! 

The two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between 
their piercing points, he writhed, tormented. Suddenly he was aware of 
himself again. Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and 
with one remaining instant in which to do so. He took the Ring off his 
finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat. A black 
shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him; it missed Amon Hen and 
groped 

out west, and faded. Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in 
every tree. 

Frodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him, but his will was 
firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. T will do now what I 
must,' he said. This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at 
work even in the Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more 
harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust are too 
dear to me: poor old Sam, and Merry and Pippin. Strider, too: his heart 
yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen 
into evil. I will go alone. At once.' 

He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir 
had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries and 
calls from the woods near the shore below. 

'They'll be hunting for me,' he said. T wonder how long I have been 
away. Hours, I should think.' He hesitated. 'What can I do? ' he muttered. 

'I must go now or I shall never go. I shan't get a chance again. I hate 
leaving them, and like this without any explanation. But surely they will 
understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?' 

Slowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He vanished and 
passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind. 




The others remained long by the river -side. For some time they had been 
silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and 
they were talking. Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other 
things, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn 
concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of 
its great works that could still be seen in this strange border -land of the 
Emyn Muil: the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great 
Stair beside the falls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words 
strayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do? Why 
was 

he hesitating? 

'He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,’ said 
Aragorn. 'And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company 
to go east, since we have been tracked by Gollum, and must fear that the 
secret of our journey is already betrayed. But Minas Tirith is no nearer to 
the Fire and the destruction of the Burden. 

'We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord 
Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond 
his power: either to keep the Burden secret, or to hold off the full might 
of the Enemy when he comes to take it. Which way would any of us choose in 
Frodo’s place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.’ 

’Grievous is our loss,’ said Legolas. ’Yet we must needs make up our 
minds without his aid. Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call 
him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.’ 

'And so should I,’ said Gimli. ’We, of course, were only sent to help 
the Bearer along the road, to go no further than we wished; and none of us 
is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom. Hard was my parting 
from 

Lothlurien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached the 
last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose 
Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.’ 

'And I too will go with him,’ said Legolas. 'It would be faithless now 
to say farewell.’ 

’It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,’ said Aragorn. ’But 
if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all 
should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, 
or one alone. If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three 




companions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself. 
Boromir will return to his own city, where his father and his people need 
him; and with him the others should go, or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin, 
if Legolas is not willing to leave us.' 

'That won’t do at all! ' cried Merry. 'We can't leave Frodo! Pippin and 
I always intended to go wherever he went, and we still do. But we did not 
realize what that would mean. It seemed different so far away, in the Shire 
or in Ri vendell. It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor. Why 
can't we stop him?' 

'We must stop him,' said Pippin. 'And that is what he is worrying 
about, I am sure. He knows we shan't agree to his going east. And he doesn't 
like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to 
Mordor alone! ' Pippin shuddered. 'But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought 
to know that he hasn't got to ask. He ought to know that if we can't stop 
him, we shan't leave him.' 

'Begging your pardon,' said Sam. 'I don't think you understand my 
master at all. He isn't hesitating about which way to go. Of course not! 
What's the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your 
pardon, 

Master Boromir,' he added, and turned. It was then that they discovered that 
Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle, 
was no longer there. 

'Now where's he got to? ' cried Sam, looking worried. 'He's been a bit 
queer lately, to my mind. But anyway he's not in this business. He's off to 
his home, as he always said; and no blame to him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows 
he's got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can. But he's afraid. Now it's 
come to the point, he's just plain terrified. That's what his trouble is. Of 
course he's had a bit of schooling, so to speak-we all have-since we left 
home, or he'd be so terrified he'd just fling the Ring in the River and 
bolt. But he's still too frightened to start. And he isn't worrying about us 
either: whether we'll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That's 
another thing that's bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he'll 
want to go alone. Mark my words! We're going to have trouble when he 
comes 

back. For he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's Baggins.' 

'I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,' said Aragorn. 
'And what shall we do, if you prove right? ’ 




'Stop him! Don't let him go! ' cried Pippin. 

'I wonder? ' said Aragorn. 'He is the Bearer, and the fate of the 
Burden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or 
the other. Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried. There are 
other powers at work far stronger.' 

'Well, I wish Frodo would "screw himself up" and come back, and let us 
get it over,' said Pippin. 'This waiting is horrible! Surely the time is up? 

f 

'Yes,' said Aragorn. 'The hour is long passed. The morning is wearing 
away. We must call for him.' 

At that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from the trees and 
walked towards them without speaking. His face looked grim and sad. He 
paused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with 
his eyes on the ground. 

'Where have you been, Boromir? ’ asked Aragorn. 'Have you seen Frodo? ’ 

Boromir hesitated for a second. 'Yes, and no,’ he answered slowly. 

'Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke to him. I urged him to 
come to Minas Tirith and not to go east. I grew angry and he left me. He 
vanished. I have never seen such a thing happen before, though I have heard 
of it in tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not find him again. I 
thought he would return to you.' 

'Is that all that you have to say? ' said Aragorn, looking hard and not 
too kindly at Boromir. 

'Yes,' he answered. 'I will say no more yet.’ 

'This is bad!' cried Sam, jumping up. 'I don't know what this Man has 
been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on? He didn't ought to have; 
and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!' 

'But he wouldn't keep it on' 1 said Merry. 'Not when he had escaped the 
unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.' 

'But where did he go? Where is he? ' cried Pippin. 'He's been away ages 
now.' 

'How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? ' asked Aragorn. 

'Half an hour, maybe,' he answered. 'Or it might be an hour. I have 
wandered for some time since. I do not know! I do not know! ' He put his 
head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief. 

'An hour since he vanished! ' shouted Sam. 'We must try and find him at 
once. Come on! ’ 




'Wait a moment! ' cried Aragorn. 'We must divide up into pairs, and 
arrange-here, hold on! Wait! ' 

It was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed off first. 
Merry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into 
the trees by the shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo ! in their clear, high 
hobbit- voices. Legolas and Gimli were running. A sudden panic or madness 
seemed to have fallen on the Company. 

'We shall all be scattered and lost,’ groaned Aragorn. 'Boromir! I do 
not know what part you have played in this mischief, but help now! Go after 
those two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot 
find Frodo. Come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I 
shall return soon.' 

Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam. Just as he 
reached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him, toiling uphill, 
panting and calling, Frodo! 

'Come with me, Sam! ’ he said. 'None of us should be alone. There is 
mischief about. I feel it. I am going to the top, to the Seat of Amon Hen, 
to see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went 
this way. Follow me, and keep your eyes open! ' He sped up the path. 

Sam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and 
soon fell behind. He had not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead. 
Sam stopped and puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head. 

'Whoa, Sam Gamgee! ’ he said aloud. 'Your legs are too short, so use 
your head! Let me see now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not his way; but he 
hasn't told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed 
himself up to the point, sudden. He made up his mind at last to go. Where 
to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That's hard, cruel 
hard.' 

Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. 'Steady, 
Gamgee! ' he said. 'Think, if you can! He can't fly across rivers, and he 
can't jump waterfalls. He's got no gear. So he's got to get back to the 
boats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning! ' 

Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up 
he got and ran on. He came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the 
shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the water. No one was there. 
There seemed to be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He 
stood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the 




bank all by itself. With a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat 
slipped into the wat 



128d 



er. 

'Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming! ' called Sam, and flung himself from the 
bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a yard. With a cry 
and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went 
under, and the River closed over his curly head. 

An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and 
the boat put about. Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he 
came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes. 

'Up you come, Sam my lad! ’ said Frodo. 'Now take my hand! ' 

'Save me, Mr. Frodo! ’ gasped Sam. 'I'm drownded. I can’t see your 
hand.’ 

'Here it is. Don't pinch, lad! I won’t let you go. Tread water and 
don’t flounder, or you'll upset the boat. There now, get hold of the side, 
and let me use the paddle! ' 

With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank, and Sam was 
able to scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off the Ring and 
stepped ashore again. 

'Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam! ’ he said. 

’Oh, Mr. Frodo, that’s hard! ’ said Sam shivering. 'That’s hard, trying 
to go without me and all. If I hadn’t a guessed right, where would you be 
now? ’ 

'Safely on my way.’ 

'Safely! ’ said Sam. 'All alone and without me to help you? I couldn’t 
have a borne it, it’d have been the death of me.’ 

’It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,’ said Frodo and I 
could not have borne that.’ 

'Not as certain as being left behind,’ said Sam. 

'But I am going to Mordor.’ 

'I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I’m coming 
with you.’ 

'Now, Sam,’ said Frodo, 'don’t hinder me! The others will be coming 
back at any minute. If they catch me here. I shall have to argue and 




explain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off. But I 
must go at once. It's the only way.’ 

'Of course it is,' answered Sam. 'But not alone. I'm coming too, or 
neither of us isn’t going. I'll knock holes in all the boats first.' 

Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. 
'Leave one! 'he said. 'We'll need it. But you can't come like this without 
your gear or food or anything.' 

'Just hold on a moment, and I'll get my stuff!' cried Sam eagerly. 

'It's all ready. I thought we should be off today.' He rushed to the camping 
place, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he 
emptied the boat of his companions' goods grabbed a spare blanket, and some 
extra packages of food, and ran back. 

'So all my plan is spoilt! ’ said Frodo. 'It is no good trying to 
escape you. But I’m glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is 
plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find 
a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we shall see them 
again.' 

'Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,' said Sam. 

So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo 
paddled away from the shore, and the River bore them swiftly away, down the 
western arm, and past the frowning cliffs of Tol Brandir. The roar of the 
great falls drew nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, it was hard 
work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive 
the boat eastward towards the far shore. 

At length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon 
Lhaw. There they found a shelving shore, and they drew the boat out, high 
above the water, and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder. 

Then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would 
bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and down into the Land of 
Shadow. 




Here ends the first part of the history of the War of the Ring. 

The second part is called THE TWO TOWERS, since the events recounted 
in it are dominated by ORTHANC, the citadel of Saruman, and the fortress 
o/MINAS MORGUL that guards the secret entrance to Mordor; it tells of 
the deeds and perils of all the members of the now sundered fellowship, until 
the coming of the Great Darkness. 

The third part tells of the last defence against the Shadow, and the 
end of the mission of the Ring-bearer in THE RETURN OF THE KING.

* BOOK III * 



Chapter 1 . The Departure of Boromir 

Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. 
Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to 
read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet 
earth he saw what he was seeking. 

'I read the signs aright,' he said to himself. 'Frodo ran to the 
hill-top. I wonder what he saw there? But he returned by the same way, and 
went down the hill again.' 

Aragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to 
see there something that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was 
pressing. Suddenly he leaped forward, and ran to the summit, across the 
great flag-stones, and up the steps. Then sitting in the high seat he looked 
out. But the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. He turned 
from the North back again to North, and saw nothing save the distant hills, 
unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle 
high in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth. 

Even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, 
on the west side of the River. He stiffened. There were cries, and among 
them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of Ores. Then 
suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it 
smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above 
the roaring of the falls. 

'The horn of Boromir!' he cried. 'He is in need!' He sprang down the 
steps and away, leaping down the path. 'Alas ! An ill fate is on me this day, 
and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?' 

As he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the 
horn was blowing. Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Ores, and suddenly 
the horn-calls ceased. Aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he 
could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the 
left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them 
no more. Drawing his bright sword and crying Elendil! Elendil! he crashed 
through the trees. 




A mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake 
he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was 
resting. But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered 
arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; 
his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Ores lay slain, piled all about 
him and at his feet. 

Aragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. 

At last slow words came. 'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo ' he said. 'I 
am sorry. I have paid.' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at 
least lay there. 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Ores have taken them. I 
think they are not dead. Ores bound them.' He paused and his eyes closed 
wearily. After a moment he spoke again. 

’Farewell, Aragorn! Goto Minas Tirith and save my people! I have 
failed.' 

'No!' said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. 'You have 
conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall 
not fall!' 

Boromir smiled. 

'Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?' said Aragorn. 

But Boromir did not speak again. 

'Alas!' said Aragorn. 'Thus passes the heir of Denethor, Lord of the 
Tower of Guard! This is a bitter end. Now the Company is all in ruin. It is 
I that have failed. Vain was Gandalfs trust in me. What shall I do now? 
Boromir has laid it on me to go to Minas Tirith, and my heart desires it; 
but where are the Ring and the Bearer? How shall I find them and save the 
Quest from disaster?' 

He knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir's hand. 

So it was that Legolas and Gimli found him. They came from the western 
slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were 
hunting. Gimli had his axe in hand, and Legolas his long knife: all his 
arrows were spent. When they came into the glade they halted in amazement; 
and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to 
them plain what had happened. 

'Alas!' said Legolas, coming to Aragorn's side. 'We have hunted and 
slain many Ores in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. We 
came when we heard the horn-but too late, it seems. I fear you have taken 
deadly hurt.' 




'Boromir is dead,' said Aragorn. 'I am unscathed, for I was not here 
with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill.' 

'The hobbits!' cried Gimli 'Where are they then? Where is Frodo?' 

'I do not know,' answered Aragorn wearily. 'Before he died Boromir told 
me that the Ores had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. I 
sent him to follow Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam 
were with him: not until it was too late. All that I have done today has 
gone amiss. What is to be done now?' 

'First we must tend the fallen,' said Legolas. 'We cannot leave him 
lying like carrion among these foul Ores.' 

'But we must be swift,' said Gimli. 'He would not wish us to linger. We 
must follow the Ores, if there is hope that any of our Company are living 
prisoners.' 

'But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them or not ' said 
Aragorn. 'Are we to abandon him? Must we not seek him first? An evil choice 
is now before us!' 

'Then let us do first what we must do,' said Legolas. 'We have not the 
time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A 
cairn we might build.' 

'The labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could 
use nearer than the water -side,' said Gimli. 

'Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his 
vanquished foes,' said Aragorn. 'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and 
give him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil 
creature dishonours his bones.' 

Quickly they searched the bodies of the Ores, gathering their swords 
and cloven helms and shields into a heap. 'See!' cried Aragorn. 'Here we 
find tokens!' He picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, 
leaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also 
the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. 'No ore-tools these!' he said. 

'They were borne by the hobbits. Doubtless the Ores despoiled them, but 
feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of 
Westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor. Well, now, if 
they still live, our friends are weaponless. I will take these things, 
hoping against hope, to give them back.' 

'And I,' said Legolas, 'will take all the arrows that I can find, for 
my quiver is empty.' He searched in the pile and on the ground about and 




found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows 
as the Ores were accustomed to use. He looked at them closely. 

And Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'Here lie many that are 
not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty Mountains, if I 
know anything of Ores and their kinds. And here are others strange to me. 
Their gear is not after the manner of Ores at all!' 

There were four goblin- soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, 
with thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short broad-bladed 
swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with Ores: and they had bows of 
yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men. Upon their shields they bore 
a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the 
front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal. 

'I have not seen these tokens before,' said Aragorn. ’What do they 
mean?' 

'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. That is easy to read.' 

'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.' 

'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or 
spoken,' said Aragorn. 'And he does not use white. The Ores in the service 
of Barad-dyr use the sign of the Red Eye.' He stood for a moment in thought. 
'S is for Saruman, I guess,' he said at length. 'There is evil afoot in 
Isengard, and the West is no longer safe. It is as Gandalf feared: by some 
means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. It is likely too that 
he knows of Gandalf s fall. Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the 
vigilance of Lurien, or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard 
by other paths. Ores travel fast. But Saruman has many ways of learning 
news. Do you remember the birds?' 

'Well, we have no time to ponder riddles,' said Gimli. 'Let us bear 
Boromir away!' 

'But after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our 
course rightly,' answered Aragorn. 

'Maybe there is no right choice,' said Gimli. 

Taking his axe the Dwarf now cut several branches. These they lashed 
together with bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. Upon this 
rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore, together 
with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. 

It was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for Boromir was a 
man both tall and strong. 




At the water-side Aragorn remained, watching the bier, while Legolas 
and Gimli hastened back on foot to Parth Galen. It was a mile or more, and 
it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the 
shore. 

There is a strange tale to tell!' said Legolas. 'There are only two 
boats upon the bank. We could find no trace of the other.' 

'Have Ores been there?' asked Aragorn. 

'We saw no signs of them,' answered Gimli. 'And Ores would have taken 
or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.' 

'I will look at the ground when we come there,' said Aragorn. 

Now they laid Boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him 
away. The grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. 
They combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. The golden 
belt of Lurien gleamed about his waist. His helm they set beside him, and 
across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards of his 
sword; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies. Then fastening 
the prow to the stern of the other boat, they drew him out into the water. 

They rowed sadly along the shore, and turning into the swift-running channel 
they passed the green sward of Parth Galen. The steep sides of Tol Brandir 
were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon. As they went south the fume of 
Rauros rose and shimmered before them, a haze of gold. The rush and thunder 
of the falls shook the windless air. 

Sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there Boromir lay, 
restful, peaceful, gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water. The stream 
took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles. He floated 
by them, and slowly his boat departed, waning to a dark spot against the 
golden light; and then suddenly it vanished. Rauros roared on unchanging. 
The River had taken Boromir son of Denethor, and he was not seen again in 
Minas Tirith, standing as he used to stand upon the White Tower in the 
morning. But in Gondor in after-days it long was said that the elven-boat 
rode the falls and the foaming pool, and bore him down through Osgiliath, 
and past the many mouths of Anduin, out into the Great Sea at night under 
the stars. 

For a while the three companions remained silent, gazing after him. 

Then Aragorn spoke. 'They will look for him from the White Tower,' he said, 
'but he will not return from mountain or from sea.' Then slowly he began to 
sing: 




Through Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows 
The West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes. 

'What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight? 

Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?' 

7 saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey; 

I saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away 
Into the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more. 

The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor. ' 

'O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar, 

But you came not from the empty lands where no men are. ' 

Then Legolas sang: 

From the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones; 
The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans. 

'What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve? 

Where now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve. ' 

'Ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie 
On the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky; 

So many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing Sea. 

Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!' 

'O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south, 

But you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea's mouth. ' 

Then Aragorn sang again: 

From the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides, and past the roaring falls; 

And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls. 

'What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me today? 

What news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away. ' 

'Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought. 

His cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought. 

His head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest; 

And Rauros, golden Rauros-faUs, bore him upon its breast. ' 

'O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze 
To Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days. ' 

So they ended. Then they turned their boat and drove it with all the 
speed they could against the stream back to Parth Galen. 

'You left the East Wind to me,' said Gimli, 'but I will say naught of 
it.’ 

’That is as it should be,' said Aragorn. 'In Minas Tirith they endure 
the East Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. But now Boromir has taken 




his road, and we must make haste to choose our own.' 

He surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping often to 
the earth. The Ores have been on this ground,' he said. 'Otherwise nothing 
can be made out for certain. All our footprints are here, crossing and 
re-crossing. I cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since 
the search for Frodo began.' He returned to the bank, close to where the 
rill from the spring trickled out into the River. 'There are some clear 
prints here,' he said. 'A hobbit waded out into the water and back; but I 
cannot say how long ago.' 

'How then do you read this riddle?' asked Gimli. 

Aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and 
looked at the baggage. 'Two packs are missing.' he said, 'and one is 
certainly Sam's: it was rather large and heavy. This then is the answer: 
Frodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with him. Frodo must have 
returned while we were all away. I met Sam going up the hill and told him to 
follow me; but plainly he did not do so. He guessed his master s mind and 
came back here before Frodo had gone. He did not find it easy to leave Sam 
behind!' 

'But why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said Gimli. 
'That was a strange deed!' 

'And a brave deed,' said Aragorn. 'Sam was right, I think. Frodo did 
not wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he knew that he 
must go himself. Something happened after he left us that overcame his fear 
and doubt.' 

'Maybe hunting Ores came on him and he fled,' said Legolas. 

'He fled, certainly,' said Aragorn, 'but not, I think, from Ores.' What 
he thought was the cause of Frodo's sudden resolve and flight Aragorn did 
not say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret. 

'Well, so much at least is now clear,' said Legolas: 'Frodo is no 
longer on this side of the River: only he can have taken the boat. And Sam 
is with him; only he would have taken his pack.' 

'Our choice then,' said Gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat 
and follow Frodo, or else to follow the Ores on foot. There is little hope 
either way. We have already lost precious hours.' 

'Let me think!' said Aragorn. 'And now may I make a right choice and 
change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' He stood silent for a moment. 'I 
will follow the Ores,' he said at last. 'I would have guided Frodo to Mordor 




and gone with him to the end; but if I seek him now in the wilderness, I 
must abandon the captives to torment and death. My heart speaks clearly at 
last: the fate of the Bearer is in my hands no longer. The Company has 
played its part. Yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we 
have strength left. Come! We will go now. Leave all that can be spared 
behind! We will press on by day and dark!' 

They drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees. They laid 
beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry 
away. Then they left Parth Galen. The afternoon was fading as they came back 
to the glade where Boromir had fallen. There they picked up the trail of the 
Ores. It needed little skill to find. 

'No other folk make such a trampling,' said Legolas. 'It seems their 
delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their 
way.' 

'But they go with a great speed for all that,' said Aragorn, 'and they 
do not tire. And later we may have to search for our path in hard bare 
lands.' 

'Well, after them!' said Gimli. 'Dwarves too can go swiftly, and they 
do not tire sooner than Ores. But it will be a long chase: they have a long 
start.' 

'Yes,' said Aragorn, 'we shall all need the endurance of Dwarves. But 
come! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. And 
woe to them, if we prove the swifter! We will make such a chase as shall be 
accounted a marvel among the Three Kindreds p Elves. Dwarves, and Men. 
Forth 

the Three Hunters!' 

Like a deer he sprang away. Through the trees he sped. On and on he led 
them, tireless and swift, now that his mind was at last made up. The woods 
about the lake they left behind. Long slopes they climbed, dark, hard-edged 
against the sky already red with sunset. Dusk came. They passed away, grey 
shadows in a stony land. 




Chapter 2 . The Riders of Rohan 



Dusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and brooded 
on the pale margins of the Anduin, but the sky was clear. Stars came out. 

The waxing moon was riding in the West, and the shadows of the rocks were 
black. They had come to the feet of stony hills, and their pace was slower, 
for the trail was no longer easy to follow. Here the highlands of the Emyn 
Muil ran from North to South in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of 
each ridge was steep and difficult, but the eastward slopes were gentler, 
furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines. All night the three 
companions scrambled in this bony land, climbing to the crest of the first 
and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley 
on the other side. 

There in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. 

The moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the 
first light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind. For the 
moment Aragorn was at a loss: the ore -trail had descended into the valley, 
but there it had vanished. 

’Which way would they turn, do you think?' said Legolas. 'Northward to 
take a straighter road to Isengard, or Fangorn, if that is their aim as you 
guess? Or southward to strike the Entwash?' 

'They will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at" said 
Aragorn. 'And unless there is much amiss in Rohan and the power of Saruman 
is greatly increased; they will take the shortest way that they can find 
over the fields of the Rohirrim. Fet us search northwards!' 

The dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a 
trickling stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom. A cliff frowned 
upon their right; to their left rose grey slopes, dim and shadowy in the 
late night. They went on for a mile or more northwards. Aragorn was 
searching, bent towards the ground, among the folds and gullies leading up 
into the western ridge. Fegolas was some way ahead. Suddenly the Elf gave a 
cry and the others came running towards him. 

'We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' he said. 
'Eook!' He pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken to be 
boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. Five dead Ores 




lay there. They had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been 
beheaded. The ground was wet with their dark blood. 

'Here is another riddle!' said Gimli. 'But it needs the light of day 
and for that we cannot wait.' 

'Yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,' said Legolas. 

'Enemies of the Ores are likely to be our friends. Do any folk dwell in 
these hills?' 

'No,' said Aragorn. 'The Rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far from 
Minas Tirith. It might be that some company of Men were hunting here for 
reasons that we do not know. Yet I think not.' 

'What do you think?' said Gimli. 

'I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' answered 
Aragorn. 'These are Northern Ores from far away. Among the slain are none of 
the great Ores with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is 
no uncommon thing with these foul folk. Maybe there was some dispute about 
the road.' 

'Or about the captives,' said Gimli. 'Let us hope that they, too, did 
not meet their end here.' 

Aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of 
the fight could be found. They went on. Already the eastward sky was turning 
pale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly growing. A little 
further north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream, falling and 
winding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. In it some bushes grew, 
and there were patches of grass upon its sides. 

'At last!' said Aragorn. 'Here are the tracks that we seek! Up this 
water -channel: this is the way that the Ores went after their debate.' 

Swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path. As if fresh 
from a night's rest they sprang from stone to stone. At last they reached 
the crest of the grey hill, and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and 
stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn. 

Turning back they saw across the River the far hills kindled. Day 
leaped into the sky. The red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the 
dark land. Before them in the West the world lay still, formless and grey; 
but even as they looked, the shadows of night melted, the colours of the 
waking earth returned: green flowed over the wide meads of Rohan; the white 
mists shimmered in the watervales; and far off to the left, thirty leagues 
or more, blue and purple stood the White Mountains, rising into peaks of 




jet, tipped with glimmering snows, flushed with the rose of morning. 

'Gondor! Gondor!' cried Aragorn. 'Would that I looked on you again in 
happier hour! Not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams. 

Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea! 

West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree 

Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old. 

O proud walls! White towers! O winged crown and throne of gold! 

O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, 

Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea? 

Now let us go!' he said, drawing his eyes away from the South, and 
looking out west and north to the way that he must tread. 

The ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before 
their feet. Below it twenty fathoms or more, there was a wide and rugged 
shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the East Wall of 
Rohan. So ended the Emyn Muil, and the green plains of the Rohirrim 
stretched away before them to the edge of sight. 

'Look!' cried Legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. 'There 
is the eagle again! Ele is very high. He seems to be flying now away, from 
this land back to the North. He is going with great speed. Look!' 

'No, not even my eyes can see him, my good Legolas,' said Aragorn. 'He 
must be far aloft indeed. I wonder what is his errand, if he is the same 
bird that I have seen before. But look! I can see something nearer at hand 
and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!' 

'Many things,' said Legolas. 'It is a great company on foot; but I 
cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. They are many 
leagues away: twelve, I guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to 
measure.' 

'I think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us 
which way to go,' said Gimli. 'Let us find a path down to the fields as 
quick as may be.' 

'I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the Ores 
chose,' said Aragorn. 

They followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. It seemed 
that the Ores had pressed on with all possible speed. Every now and again 
the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the 
rinds and crusts of hard grey bread, a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed 
shoe broken on the stones. The trail led them north along the top of the 




escarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a 
stream that splashed noisily down. In the narrow ravine a rough path 
descended like a steep stair into the plain. 

At the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of 
Rohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The 
falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants, and 
they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle slopes 
towards the fens of Entwash Vale far away. They seemed to have left winter 
clinging to the hills behind. Elere the air was softer and warmer, and 
faintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing 
again in herb and leaf. Legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a 
great draught after long thirst in barren places. 

'Ah! the green smell!' he said. 'It is better than much sleep. Let us 
run!' 

'Light feet may run swiftly here,' said Aragorn. 'More swiftly, maybe, 
than iron-shod Ores. Now we have a chance to lessen their lead!' 

They went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an 
eager light was in their eyes. Nearly due west the broad swath of the 
marching Ores tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass of Rohan had been 
bruised and blackened as they passed. Presently Aragorn gave a cry and 
turned aside. 'Stay!' he shouted. 'Do not follow me yet!' He ran quickly to 
the right, away from the main trail; for he had seen footprints that went 
that way, branching off from the others, the marks of small unshod feet. 
These, however, did not go far before they were crossed by ore-prints, also 
coming out from the main trail behind and in front, and then they curved 
sharply back again and were lost in the trampling. At the furthest point 
Aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back. 

'Yes,' he said, 'they are quite plain: a hobbit's footprints. Pippin's 
I think. He is smaller than the other. And look at this ! He held up a thing 
that glittered in the sunlight. It looked like the new-opened leaf of a 
beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain. 

'The brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried Legolas and Gimli together. 

'Not idly do the leaves of Lurien fall,' said Aragorn. 'This did not 
drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. I 
think Pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.' 

'Then he at least was alive,' said Gimli. 'And he had the use of his 
wits, and of his legs too. That is heartening. We do not pursue in vain.' 




’Let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,' said 
Legolas. 'Come! Let us go on! The thought of those merry young folk driven 
like cattle burns my heart.' 

The sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky. Light 
clouds came up out of the sea in the distant South and were blown away upon 
the breeze. The sun sank. Shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from 
the East. Still the hunters held on. One day now had passed since Boromir 
fell, and the Ores were yet far ahead. No longer could any sight of them be 
seen in the level plains. 

As nightshade was closing about them Aragorn halted. Only twice in the 
day's march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay 
between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn. 

'We have come at last to a hard choice,' he said. 'Shall we rest by 
night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?' 

'Unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we 
stay to sleep.' said Legolas. 'Surely even Ores must pause on the march?' 
said Gimli. 'Seldom will Ores journey in the open under the sun. yet these 
have done so,' said Legolas. 'Certainly they will not rest by night.' 

'But if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' said Gimli. 

'The trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my 
eyes can see,' said Legolas. 

'Maybe, I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the 
line,' said Aragorn; 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when 
light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.' 

'And there is this also,' said Gimli: 'only by day can we see if any 
tracks lead away. If a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried 
off, eastward, say, to the Great River, towards Mordor, we might pass the 
signs and never know it.' 

'That is true,' said Aragorn. 'But if I read the signs back yonder 
rightly, the Ores of the White Hand prevailed, and the whole company is now 
bound for Isengard. Their present course bears me out.' 

'Yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,' said Gimli. 'And 
what of escape? In the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to 
the brooch.' 

'The Ores will be doubly on their guard since then, and the prisoners 
even wearier,' said Legolas. 'There will be no escape again, if we do not 
contrive it. How that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must 




overtake them.' 

'And yet even I, Dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my 
folk, cannot run all the way to Isengard without any pause ' said Gimli. 'My 
heart burns me too, and I would have started sooner but now I must rest a 
little to run the better. And if we rest, then the blind night is the time 
to do so.' 

'I said that it was a hard choice,' said Aragorn. 'How shall we end 
this debate?' 

'You are our guide,' said Gimli, 'and you are skilled in the chase. You 
shall choose.' 

'My heart bids me go on,' said Legolas. 'But we must hold together. I 
will follow your counsel.' 

'You give the choice to an ill chooser,' said Aragorn. 'Since we passed 
through the Argonath my choices have gone amiss.' He fell silent gazing 
north and west into the gathering night for a long while. 

'We will not walk in the dark,' he said at length. 'The peril of 
missing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the 
greater. If the Moon gave enough light, we would use it, but alas ! he sets 
early and is yet young and pale.' 

'And tonight he is shrouded anyway,' Gimli murmured. 'Would that the 
Lady had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to Frodo!' 

'It will be more needed where it is bestowed,' said Aragorn. 'With him 
lies the true Quest. Ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this 
time. A vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can 
mar or mend. Well, I have chosen. So let us use the time as best we may!' 

He cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he had 
not slept since their night under the shadow of Tol Brandir. Before dawn was 
in the sky he woke and rose. Gimli was still deep in slumber, but Legolas 
was standing, gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as 
a young tree in a windless night. 

'They are far far away,' he said sadly, turning to Aragorn. 'I know in 
my heart that they have not rested this night. Only an eagle could overtake 
them now.' 

'Nonetheless we will still follow as we may,' said Aragorn. Stooping he 
roused the Dwarf. 'Come! We must go,' he said. 'The scent is growing cold.' 

'But it is still dark,' said Gimli. 'Even Legolas on a hill-top could 
not see them till the Sun is up.' 




'I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon 
or sun,' said Legolas. 

'Where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,' said Aragorn. 'The 
land must groan under their hated feet.' He stretched himself upon the 
ground with his ear pressed against the turf. He lay there motionless, for 
so long a time that Gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again. 
Dawn came glimmering, and slowly a grey light grew about them. At last he 
rose, and now his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his 
look was troubled. 

'The rumour of the earth is dim and confused,' he said. 'Nothing walks 
upon it for many miles about us. Faint and far are the feet of our enemies. 

But loud are the hoofs of the horses. It comes to my mind that I heard them, 
even as I lay on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams: horses 
galloping, passing in the West. But now they are drawing ever further from 
us, riding northward. I wonder what is happening in this land!' 

'Let us go!' said Legolas. 

So the third day of their pursuit began. During all its long hours of 
cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no 
weariness could quench the fire that burned them. They seldom spoke. Over 
the wide solitude they passed and their elven-cloaks faded against the 
background of the grey -green fields; even in the cool sunlight of mid-day 
few but elvish eyes would have marked them, until they were close at hand. 
Often in their hearts they thanked the Lady of Lurien for the gift of 
lembas, for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran. 

All day the track of their enemies led straight on, going north-west 
without a break or turn. As once again the day wore to its end they came to 
long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low 
humpbacked downs ahead. The ore-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards 
them, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter. Far away to the 
left the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. No moving 
thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast 
or man. The dwellings of the Rohirrim were for the most part many leagues 
away to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now 
hidden 

in mist and cloud; yet the Horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and 
studs in the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the 
herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. 




But now all the land was empty, and there was silence that did not seem to 
be the quiet of peace. 

At dusk they halted again. Now twice twelve leagues they had passed 
over the plains of Rohan and the wall of the Emyn Muil was lost in the 
shadows of the East. The young moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it 
gave small light, and the stars were veiled. 

'Now do I most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said 
Legolas. 'The Ores have run before us, as if the very whips of Sauron were 
behind them. I fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, 
and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.' 

Gimli ground his teeth. 'This is a bitter end to our hope and to all 
our toil!' he said. 

'To hope, maybe, but not to toil,' said Aragorn. 'We shall not turn 
back here. Yet I am weary.' He gazed back along the way that they had come 
towards the night gathering in the East. 'There is something strange at work 
in this land. I distrust the silence. I distrust even the pale Moon. The 
stars are faint; and I am weary as I have seldom been before, weary as no 
Ranger should be with a clear trail to follow. There is some will that lends 
speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is 
in the heart more than in the limb.' 

'Truly!' said Legolas. 'That I have known since first we came down from 
the Emyn Muil. For the will is not behind us but before us.' He pointed away 
over the land of Rohan into the darkling West under the sickle moon. 
'Saruman!' muttered Aragorn. 'But he shall not turn us back! Halt we must 
once more; for, see! even the Moon is falling into gathering cloud. But 
north lies our road between down and fen when day returns.' 

As before Legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. 'Awake! 
Awake!' he cried. 'It is a red dawn. Strange things await us by the eaves of 
the forest. Good or evil, I do not know; but we are called. Awake!' 

The others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the 
downs drew near. It was still an hour before noon when they reached them: 
green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in a line straight towards the 
North. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long strip 
of sunken land, some ten miles wide, lay between them and the river 
wandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. Just to the West of the 
southernmost slope there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and 
beaten by many trampling feet. From it the ore-trail ran out again, turning 




north along the dry skirts of the hills. Aragorn halted and examined the 
tracks closely. 

They rested here a while,' he said, 'but even the outward trail is 
already old. I fear that your heart spoke truly, Legolas: it is thrice 
twelve hours, I guess, since the Ores stood where we now stand. If they held 
to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of 
Fangorn.' 

'I can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' 
said Gimli. 'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?' 

'It is still far away,' said Aragorn. 'If I remember rightly, these 
downs run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the 
issuing of the Entwash there lies still a wide land, another fifteen leagues 
it may be.' 

'Well, let us go on,' said Gimli. 'My legs must forget the miles. They 
would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.' 

The sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line 
of downs. For many hours they had marched without rest. They were going 
slowly now, and Gimli' s back was bent. Stone-hard are the Dwarves in labour 
or journey, but this endless chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed 
in his heart. Aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping now and 
again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped 
as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass, leaving no 
footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found all the 
sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called 
by Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams, even as he 
walked open-eyed in the light of this world. 

'Let us go up on to this green hill!' he said. Wearily they followed 
him, climbing the long slope, until they came out upon the top. It was a 
round hill smooth and bare, standing by itself, the most northerly of the 
downs. The sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain. They 
were alone in a grey formless world without mark or measure. Only far away 
north-west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light: the 
Mountains of Mist and the forest at their feet. 

'Nothing can we see to guide us here,' said Gimli. 'Well, now we must 
halt again and wear the night away. It is growing cold!' 

'The wind is north from the snows,' said Aragorn. 

'And ere morning it will be in the East,' said Legolas. 'But rest if 




you must. Yet do not cast all hope away. Tomorrow is unknown. Rede oft is 
found at the rising of the Sun.' 

'Three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel ' 
said Gimli. 

The night grew ever colder. Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and 
whenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to 
and 

fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white 
stars opened in the hard black vault above. So the night passed. Together 
they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless, until 
at last the sunrise came. It was pale and clear. The wind was in the East 
and all the mists had rolled away; wide lands lay bleak about them in the 
bitter light. 

Ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that 
they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North- 
westward 

stalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy 
eaves, and its further slopes faded into the distant blue. Beyond there 
glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall 
Methedras, the last peak of the Misty Mountains. Out of the forest the 
Entwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks 
deep-cloven. The ore-trail turned from the downs towards it. 

Following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river 
back towards the forest, Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark 
swift-moving blur. He cast himself upon the ground and listened again 
intently. But Legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with 
his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small 
figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of 
their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal 
sight. Far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads. 

There was a silence in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air 
moving in the grass. 

'Riders!' cried Aragorn, springing to his feet. 'Many riders on swift 
steeds are coming towards us!' 

'Yes,' said Legolas, 'there are one hundred and five. Yellow is their 
hair, and bright are their spears. Their leader is very tall.' 

Aragorn smiled. 'Keen are the eyes of the Elves,' he said. 




'Nay! The riders are little more than five leagues distant,' said 
Legolas. 

'Five leagues or one,' said Gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare 
land. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?' 

'We will wait,' said Aragorn. 'I am weary, and our hunt has failed. Or 
at least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the 
ore -trail. We may get new s from them.' 

'Or spears,' said Gimli. 

'There are three empty saddles, but I see no hobbits,' said Legolas. 

'I did not say that we should hear good news,' said Aragorn. 'But evil 
or good we will await it here.' 

The three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy 
mark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope. 
A little above the hill's foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about 
them, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass. The time passed slowly 
and heavily. The wind was thin and searching. Gimli was uneasy. 

'What do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?' he said. 'Do we sit here 
waiting for sudden death?' 

'I have been among them,' answered Aragorn. 'They are proud and wilful, 
but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; 
wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the 
manner of the children of Men before the Dark Years. But I do not know what 
has happened here of late, nor in what mind the Rohirrim may now be between 
the traitor Saruman and the threat of Sauron. They have long been the 
friends of the people of Gondor, though they are not akin to them. It was in 
forgotten years long ago that Eorl the Young brought them out of the North, 
and their kinship is rather with the Bardings of Dale, and with the 
Beornings of the Wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and 
fair, 

as are the Riders of Rohan. At least they will not love the Ores.' 

'But Gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor ' said 
Gimli. 

'I believe it no more than did Boromir,' answered Aragorn. 

'You will soon learn the truth,' said Legolas. 'Already they approach.' 

At length even Gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. 

The horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and were 
drawing near the downs. They were riding like the wind. 




Now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. 
Suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman 
swerved, passing by the foot of the hill, and leading the host back 
southward along the western skirts of the downs. After him they rode: a long 
line of mail-clad men. swift, shining, fell and fair to look upon. 

Their horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed; their grey 
coats glistened, their long tails flowed in the wind, their manes were 
braided on their proud necks. The Men that rode them matched them well: tall 
and long-limbed; their hair, flaxen-pale, flowed under their light helms, 
and streamed in long braids behind them; their faces were stern and keen. In 
their hands were tall spears of ash, painted shields were slung at their 
backs, long swords were at their belts, their burnished skirts of mail hung 
down upon their knees. 

In pairs they galloped by, and though every now and then one rose in 
his stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side, they appeared not to 
perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them. The host 
had almost passed when suddenly Aragorn stood up, and called in a loud 
voice: 

'What news from the North, Riders of Rohan?' 

With astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, 
and came charging round. Soon the three companions found themselves in a 
ring of horsemen moving in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them 
and down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. Aragorn stood 
silent, and the other two sat without moving, wondering what way things 
would turn. 

Without a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears 
were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had bows in 
hand, and their arrows were already fitted to the string. Then one rode 
forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a 
white horsetail flowed. He advanced until the point of his spear was within 
a foot of Aragorn's breast. Aragorn did not stir. 

'Who are you, and what are you doing in this land?' said the Rider, 
using the Common Speech of the West, in manner and tone like to the speech 
of Boromir, Man of Gondor. 

'I am called Strider,' answered Aragorn. 'I came out of the North. I am 
hunting Ores.' 

The Rider leaped from his horse. Giving his spear to another who rode 




up and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with 
Aragorn, surveying him keenly, and not without wonder. At length he spoke 
again. 

'At first I thought that you yourselves were Ores,' he said; 'but now I 
see that it is not so. Indeed you know little of Ores, if you go hunting 
them in this fashion. They were swift and well-armed, and they were many. 
You would have changed from hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them. 
But there is something strange about you, Strider.' He bent his clear bright 
eyes again upon the Ranger. 'That is no name for a Man that you give. And 
strange too is your raiment. Have you sprung out of the grass? How did you 
escape our sight? Are you elvish folk?' 

'No,' said Aragorn. 'One only of us is an Elf, Legolas from the 
Woodland Realm in distant Mirkwood. But we have passed through 
Lothlurien, 

and the gifts and favour of the Lady go with us.' 

The Rider looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes hardened. 
'Then there is a Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales tell!' he said. 'Lew 
escape her nets, they say. These are strange days ! But if you have her 
favour, then you also are net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.' He turned a 
cold glance suddenly upon Legolas and Gimli. 'Why do you not speak, silent 
ones?' he demanded. 

Gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand gripped the 
handle of his axe, and his dark eyes flashed. 'Give me your name, 
horse-master, and I will give you mine, and more besides,' he said. 

'As for that,' said the Rider, staring down at the Dwarf, 'the stranger 
should declare himself first. Yet I am named Jomer son of Jomund, and am 
called the Third Marshal of Riddermark.' 

'Then Jomer son of Jomund, Third Marshal of Riddermark, let Gimli the 
Dwarf Gluin's son warn you against foolish words. You speak evil of that 
which is fair beyond the reach of your thought, and only little wit can 
excuse you.' 

Jomer's eyes blazed, and the Men of Rohan murmured angrily, and closed 
in, advancing their spears. 'I would cut off your head, beard and all, 

Master Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground ' said Jomer. 

'He stands not alone,' said Legolas, bending his bow and fitting an 
arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight. 'You would die before your 
stroke fell.' 




Jomer raised his sword, and things might have gone ill, but Aragorn 
sprang between them, and raised his hand. 'Your pardon, Jomer!' he cried. 
'When you know more you will understand why you have angered my 
companions. 

We intend no evil to Rohan, nor to any of its folk, neither to man nor to 
horse. Will you not hear our tale before you strike?' 

'I will,' said Jomer lowering his blade. 'But wanderers in the 
Riddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt. First 
tell me your right name.' 

'First tell me whom you serve,' said Aragorn. 'Are you friend or foe of 
Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor?' 

'I serve only the Lord of the Mark, Thjoden King son of Thengel,' 
answered Jomer. 'We do not serve the Power of the Black Land far away, but 
neither are we yet at open war with him; and if you are fleeing from him, 
then you had best leave this land. There is trouble now on all our borders, 
and we are threatened; but we desire only to be free, and to live as we have 
lived, keeping our own, and serving no foreign lord, good or evil. We 
welcomed guests kindly in the better days, but in these times the unbidden 
stranger finds us swift and hard. Come! Who are you? Whom do you serve? 
At 

whose command do you hunt Ores in our land?' 

'I serve no man,' said Aragorn; 'but the servants of Sauron I pursue 
into whatever land they may go. There are few among mortal Men who know 
more 

of Ores; and I do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. The Ores whom 
we pursued took captive two of my friends. In such need a man that has no 
horse will go on foot, and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail. 

Nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword. I am not 
weaponless.' 

Aragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped 
it, and the bright blade of And®ril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it 
out. 'Elendil!' he cried. 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn and am called 
Elessar, the Elfstone, D®nadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor. 
Here is the Sword that was Broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or 
thwart me? Choose swiftly!' 

Gimli and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had 
not seen him in this mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while 




Jomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the 
power and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes 
of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a 
shining crown. 

Jomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down his 
proud eyes. These are indeed strange days,' he muttered. 'Dreams and 
legends spring to life out of the grass. 

Tell me, lord,' he said, 'what brings you here? And what was the 
meaning of the dark words? Long has Boromir son of Denethor been gone 
seeking an answer, and the horse that we lent him came back riderless. What 
doom do you bring out of the North?' 

'The doom of choice,' said Aragorn. 'You may say this to Thjoden son of 
Thengel: open war lies before him, with Sauron or against him. None may live 
now as they have lived, and few shall keep what they call their own. But of 
these great matters we will speak later. If chance allows, I will come 
myself to the king. Now I am in great need, and I ask for help, or at least 
for tidings. You heard that we are pursuing an ore-host that carried off our 
friends. What can you tell us?' 

'That you need not pursue them further,' said Jomer. 'The Ores are 
destroyed.' 

'And our friends?' 

'We found none but Ores.' 

'But that is strange indeed,' said Aragorn. 'Did you search the slain? 

Were there no bodies other than those of ore -kind? They would be small. Only 
children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.' 

'There were no dwarves nor children,' said Jomer. 'We counted all the 
slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as 
is our custom. The ashes are smoking still.' 

'We do not speak of dwarves or children,' said Gimli. 'Our friends were 
hobbits.' 

'Hobbits?' said Jomer. 'And what may they be? It is a strange name.' 

'A strange name for a strange folk,' said Gimli. 'But these were very 
dear to us. It seems that you have heard in Rohan of the words that troubled 
Minas Tirith. They spoke of the Halfling. These hobbits are Halflings.' 

'Halflings!' laughed the Rider that stood beside Jomer. 'Halflings! But 
they are only a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the 
North. Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?' 




'A man may do both,' said Aragorn. ’For not we but those who come after 
will make the legends of our time. The green earth, say you? That is a 
mighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!' 

Time is pressing,’ said the Rider, not heeding Aragorn. 'We must 
hasten south, lord. Let us leave these wild folk to their fancies. Or let us 
bind them and take them to the king.' 

'Peace, Jothain!' said Jomer in his own tongue. 'Leave me a while. Tell 
the jored to assemble on the path' and make ready to ride to the Entwade.' 

Muttering Jothain retired, and spoke to the others. Soon they drew off 
and left Jomer alone with the three companions. 

'All that you say is strange, Aragorn.' he said. 'Yet you speak the 
truth, that is plain: the Men of the Mark do not lie, and therefore they are 
not easily deceived. But you have not told all. Will you not now speak more 
fully of your errand, so that I may judge what to do?' 

'I set out from Imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,' 
answered Aragorn. 'With me went Boromir of Minas Tirith. My errand was to 
go 

to that city with the son of Denethor, to aid his folk in their war against 
Sauron. But the Company that I journeyed with had other business. Of that I 
cannot speak now. Gandalf the Grey was our leader.' 

'Gandalf !' Jomer exclaimed. 'Gandalf Greyhame is known in the Mark: but 
his name, I warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour. He has 
been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, 
after a season, or after many years. He is ever the herald of strange 
events: a bringer of evil, some now say. 

'Indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss. 

At that time our trouble with Saruman began. Until then we counted Saruman 
our friend, hut Gandalf came then and warned us that sudden war was 
preparing in Isengard. He said that he himself had been a prisoner in 
Orthanc and had hardly escaped, and he begged for help. But Thjoden would 
not listen to him, and he went away. Speak not the name of Gandalf loudly in 
Thj oden's ears! He is wroth. For Gandalf took the horse that is called 
Shadowfax, the most precious of all the king's steeds, chief of the Mearas, 
which only the Lord of the Mark may ride. For the sire of their race was the 
great horse of Eorl that knew the speech of Men. Seven nights ago Shadowfax 
returned; but the king's anger is not less, for now the horse is wild and 
will let no man handle him.' 




’Then Shadowfax has found his way alone from the far North,' said 
Aragorn; 'for it was there that he and Gandalf parted. But alas! Gandalf 
will ride no longer. He fell into darkness in the Mines of Moria and comes 
not again.' 

'That is heavy tidings,' said Jomer. 'At least to me, and to many; 
though not to all, as you may find, if you come to the king.' 

'It is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand, 
though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older,' said Aragorn. 
'But when the great fall, the less must lead. My part it has been to guide 
our Company on the long road from Moria. Through Lurien we came — of 
which 

it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again — 
and thence down the leagues of the Great River to the falls of Rauros. There 
Boromir was slain by the same Ores whom you destroyed.' 

'Your news is all of woe!' cried Jomer in dismay. 'Great harm is this 
death to Minas Tirith, and to us all. That was a worthy man! All spoke his 
praise. He came seldom to the Mark, for he was ever in the wars on the 
East -borders; but I have seen him. More like to the swift sons of Eorl than 
to the grave Men of Gondor he seemed to me, and likely to prove a great 
captain of his people when his time came. But we have had no word of this 
grief out of Gondor. When did he fall?' 

'It is now the fourth day since he was slain,' answered Aragorn, 'and 
since the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of Tol 
Brandir.' 

'On foot?' cried Jomer. 

'Yes, even as you see us.' 

Wide wonder came into Jomer's eyes. 'Strider is too poor a name, son of 
Arathorn,' he said. 'Wingfoot I name you. This deed of the three friends 
should be sung in many a hall. Forty leagues and five you have measured ere 
the fourth day is ended! Hardy is the race of Elendil! 

'But now, lord, what would you have me do! I must return in haste to 
Thjoden. I spoke warily before my men. It is true that we are not yet at 
open war with the Black Land, and there are some, close to the king's ear, 
that speak craven counsels; but war is coming. We shall not forsake our old 
alliance with Gondor, and while they fight we shall aid them: so say I and 
all who hold with me. The East-mark is my charge, the ward of the Third 
Marshal, and I have removed all our herds and herdfolk, withdrawing them 




beyond Entwash, and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts.' 

Then you do not pay tribute to Sauron?' said Gimli. 

'We do not and we never have.' said Jomer with a flash of his eyes; 
'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. Some years ago the 
Lord of the Black Land wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but 
we refused him. for he puts beasts to evil use. Then he sent plundering 
Ores, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black horses: 
few of these are now left. Lor that reason our feud with the Ores is bitter. 

'But at this time our chief concern is with Saruman. He has claimed 
lordship over all this land, and there has been war between us for many 
months. He has taken Ores into his service, and Wolf-riders, and evil Men, 
and he has closed the Gap against us, so that we are likely to be beset both 
east and west. 

'It is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and 
dwimmer -crafty, having many guises. He walks here and there, they say, as an 
old man hooded and cloaked, very like to Gandalf, as many now recall. His 
spies slip through every net, and his birds of ill omen are abroad in the 
sky. I do not know how it will all end, and my heart misgives me; for it 
seems to me that his friends do not all dwell in Isengard. But if you come 
to the king's house, you shall see for yourself. Will you not come? Do I 
hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need?' 

'I will come when I may,' said Aragorn. 

'Come now!' said Jomer. 'The Heir of Elendil would be a strength indeed 
to the Sons of Eorl in this evil tide. There is battle even now upon the 
Westemnet, and I fear that it may go ill for us. 

'Indeed in this riding north I went without the king's leave, for in my 
absence his house is left with little guard. But scouts warned me of the 
ore-host coming down out of the East Wall three nights ago, and among them 
they reported that some bore the white badges of Saruman. So suspecting what 
I most fear, a league between Orthanc and the Dark Tower, I led forth my 
jored , men of my own household; and we overtook the Ores at nightfall two 
days ago, near to the borders of the Entwood. There we surrounded them, and 
gave battle yesterday at dawn. Fifteen of my men I lost, and twelve horses 
alas! For the Ores were greater in number than we counted on. Others joined 
them, coming out of the East across the Great River: their trail is plain to 
see a little north of this spot. And others, too, came out of the forest. 

Great Ores, who also bore the White Hand of Isengard: that kind is stronger 




and more fell than all others. 

'Nonetheless we put an end to them. But we have been too long away. We 
are needed south and west. Will you not come? There are spare horses as you 
see. There is work for the Sword to do. Yes, and we could find a use for 
Gimli’s axe and the bow of Legolas, if they will pardon my rash words 
concerning the Lady of the Wood. I spoke only as do all men in my land, and 
I would gladly learn better.' 

'I thank you for your fair words,' said Aragorn, 'and my heart desires 
to come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains.' 

'Hope does not remain,' said Jomer. 'You will not find your friends on 
the North-borders.' 

'Yet my friends are not behind. We found a clear token not far from the 
East Wall that one at least of them was still alive there. But between the 
wall and the downs we have found no other trace of them, and no trail has 
turned aside, this way or that, unless my skill has wholly left me.' 

'Then what do you think has become of them?' 

'I do not know. They may have been slain and burned among the Ores; but 
that you will say cannot be, and I do not fear it. I can only think that 
they were carried off into the forest before the battle, even before you 
encircled your foes, maybe. Can you swear that none escaped your net in such 
a way?' 

'I would swear that no Ore escaped after we sighted them,' said Jomer. 

'We reached the forest-eaves before them, and if after that any living thing 
broke through our ring, then it was no Ore and had some elvish power.' 

'Our friends were attired even as we are,' said Aragorn; 'and you 
passed us by under the full light of day.' 

'I had forgotten that,' said Jomer. 'It is hard to be sure of anything 
among so many marvels. The world is all grown strange. Elf and Dwarf in 
company walk in our daily fields; and folk speak with the Lady of the Wood 
and yet live; and the Sword comes back to war that was broken in the long 
ages ere the fathers of our fathers rode into the Mark! How shall a man 
judge what to do in such times?' 

'As he ever has judged,' said Aragorn. 'Good and ill have not changed 
since yesteryear; nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves p and 
another among Men. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden 
Wood as in his own house.' 

'True indeed,' said Jomer. 'But I do not doubt you, nor the deed which 




my heart would do. Yet I am not free to do all as I would. It is against our 
law to let strangers wander at will in our land, until the king himself 
shall give them leave, and more strict is the command in these days of 
peril. I have begged you to come back willingly with me, and you will not. 
Loth am I to begin a battle of one hundred against three.' 

’I do not think your law was made for such a chance,’ said Aragorn. 

'Nor indeed am I a stranger; for I have been in this land before, more than 
once, and ridden with the host of the Rohirrim, though under other name and 
in other guise. You I have not seen before, for you are young, but I have 
spoken with Jomund your father, and with Thjoden son of Thengel. Never in 
former days would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to 
abandon such a quest as mine. My duty at least is clear, to go on. Come now, 
son of Jomund, the choice must be made at last. Aid us, or at the worst let 
us go free. Or seek to carry out your law. If you do so there will be fewer 
to return to your war or to your king.' 

Jomer was silent for a moment, then he spoke. 'We both have need of 
haste,' he said. 'My company chafes to be away, and every hour lessens your 
hope. This is my choice. You may go; and what is more, I will lend you 
horses. This only I ask: when your quest is achieved, or is proved vain, 
return with the horses over the Entwade to Meduseld, the high house in 
Edoras where Thjoden now sits. Thus you shall prove to him that I have not 
misjudged. In this I place myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of 
your good faith. Do not fail.' 

'I will not,' said Aragorn. 

There was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his 
men, when Jomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the 
strangers; but only Jothain dared to speak openly. 

'It may be well enough for this lord of the race of Gondor, as he 
claims,' he said, 'but who has heard of a horse of the Mark being given to a 
Dwarf?' 

'No one,' said Gimli. 'And do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it. 

I would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or 
begrudged.' 

'But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said Aragorn. 

'Come, you shall sit behind me, friend Gimli, said Legolas. Then all 
will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.' 

A great dark-grey horse was brought to Aragorn, and he mounted it. 




'Hasufel is his name,' said Jomer. 'May he bear you well and to better 
fortune than Gbrulf, his late master!' 

A smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to 
Legolas. Arod was his name. But Legolas asked them to take off saddle and 
rein. 'I need them not,' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder 
Arod was tame and willing beneath him, moving here and there with but a 
spoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts. Gimli was lifted 
up behind his friend, and he clung to him, not much more at ease than Sam 
Gamgee in a boat. 

'Farewell, and may you find what you seek!' cried Jomer. 'Return with 
what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!' 

'I will come,' said Aragorn. 

'And I will come, too,' said Gimli. 'The matter of the Lady Galadriel 
lies still between us. I have yet to teach you gentle speech. ' 

'We shall see,' said Jomer. 'So many strange things have chanced that 
to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a Dwarfs axe 
will seem no great wonder. Farewell!' 

With that they parted. Very swift were the horses of Rohan. When after 
a little Gimli looked back, the company of Jomer were already small and far 
away. Aragorn did not look back: he was watching the trail as they sped on 
their way, bending low with his head beside the neck of Hasufel. Before long 
they came to the borders of the Entwash, and there they met the other trail 
of which Jomer had spoken, coming down from the East out of the Wold. 

Aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back into the 
saddle, he rode away for some distance eastward, keeping to one side and 
taking care not to override the footprints. Then he again dismounted and 
examined the ground, going backwards and forwards on foot. 

'There is little to discover,' he said when he returned. 'The main 
trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back; 
their outward course must have lain nearer the river. But this eastward 
trail is fresh and clear. There is no sign there of any feet going the other 
way, back towards Anduin. Now we must ride slower, and make sure that no 
trace or footstep branches off on either side. The Ores must have been aware 
from this point that they were pursued; they may have made some attempt to 
get their captives away before they were overtaken.' 

As they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over 
the Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of 




Fangorn loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of 
any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single Ores, 
fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey -feathered arrows sticking in 
back or throat. 

At last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the 
forest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of 
the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. Beside it was a 
great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords, bows and 
darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a great 
goblin head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. 
Further away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the 
edge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was 
covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears. 

Aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of 
battle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. By 
nightfall they had discovered no trace of Merry and Pippin. 

'We can do no more,' said Gimli sadly. 'We have been set many riddles 
since we came to Tol Brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. I would 
guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the Ores'. 

It will be hard news for Frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the 
old hobbit who waits in Rivendell. Elrond was against their coming.' 

'But Gandalf was not,' said Legolas. 

'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' 
answered Gimli. 'His foresight failed him.' 

'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for 
himself or for others,' said Aragorn. 'There are some things that it is 
better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark. But I shall 
not depart from this place yet. In any case we must here await the 
morning -light.' 

A little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a 
spreading tree: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad 
brown leaves of a former year, like dry hands with long splayed fingers; 
they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze. 

Gimli shivered. They had brought only one blanket apiece. 'Let us light 
a fire,' he said. 'I care no longer for the danger. Let the Ores come as 
thick as summer-moths round a candle!' 

'If those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them 




hither,' said Legolas. 

'And it might draw other things, neither Ore nor Hobbit,' said Aragorn. 

'We are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor Saruman. Also we are on 
the very edge of Fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that 
wood, it is said.' 

'But the Rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,' said Gimli, 

'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. Yet they passed the 
night after safely here, when their labour was ended.' 

'They were many,' said Aragorn, 'and they do not heed the wrath of 
Fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the trees. But 
our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. So have a care! 

Cut no living wood!' 

'There is no need,' said Gimli. 'The Riders have left chip and bough 
enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.' He went off to gather fuel, 
and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but Aragorn sat silent 
with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and Legolas stood alone in 
the open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, 
as one who listens to voices calling from a distance. 

When the Dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions 
drew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with their hooded 
forms. Legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them. 

'Look!' he said. 'The tree is glad of the fire!' 

It may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes, but 
certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this 
way and that so as to come above the flames, while the upper branches were 
stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff, and rubbed together 
like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth. 

There was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near 
at hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of secret 
purpose. After a while Legolas spoke again. 

'Celeborn warned us not to go far into Fangorn,' he said. 'Do you know 
why, Aragorn? What are the fables of the forest that Boromir had heard?' 

'I have heard many tales in Gondor and elsewhere,' said Aragorn, 'but 
if it were not for the words of Celeborn I should deem them only fables that 
Men have made as true knowledge fades. I had thought of asking you what 
was 

the truth of the matter. And if an Elf of the Wood does not know, how shall 




a Man answer?' 

’You have journeyed further than I,' said Legolas. 'I have heard 
nothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell how the Onodrim, 
that Men call Ents, dwelt there long ago; for Fangorn is old, old even as 
the Elves would reckon it.' 

'Yes, it is old,' said Aragorn, 'as old as the forest by the 
Barrow-downs, and it is far greater. Elrond says that the two are akin, the 
last strongholds of the mighty woods of the Elder Days, in which the 
Firstborn roamed while Men still slept. Yet Fangorn holds some secret of its 
own. What it is I do not know.' 

'And I do not wish to know,' said Gimli. 'Let nothing that dwells in 
Fangorn be troubled on my account!' 

They now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch 
fell to Gimli. The others lay down. Almost at once sleep laid hold on them. 
'Gimli!' said Aragorn drowsily. 'Remember, it is perilous to cut bough or 
twig from a living tree in Fangorn. But do not stray far in search of dead 
wood. Let the fire die rather! Call me at need!' 

With that he fell asleep. Legolas already lay motionless, his fair 
hands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and 
deep dream, as is the way with Elves. Gimli sat hunched by the fire, running 
his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. The tree rustled. There 
was no other sound. 

Suddenly Gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light 
stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his 
wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes. Gimli sprang up, too 
amazed 

for the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind 
that Saruman had caught them. Both Aragorn and Legolas, roused by his 
sudden 

movement, sat up and stared. The old man did not speak or make, sign. 

'Well, father, what can we do for you?' said Aragorn, leaping to his 
feet. 'Come and be warm, if you are cold!' He strode forward, but the old 
man was gone. There was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they 
did not dare to wander far. The moon had set and the night was very dark. 

Suddenly Legolas gave a cry. 'The horses! The horses!' 

The horses were gone. They had dragged their pickets and disappeared. 
For me time the three companions stood still and silent, troubled by this 




new stroke of ill fortune. They were under the eaves of Fangorn, and endless 
leagues lay between them and the Men of Rohan, their only friends in this 
wide and dangerous land. As they stood, it seemed to them that they heard, 
far off in the night, the sound of horses whinnying and neighing. Then all 
was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind. 

'Well, they are gone,' said Aragorn at last. 'We cannot find them or 
catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do 
without. We started on our feet, and we have those still.' 

'Feet!' said Gimli. 'But we cannot eat them as well as walk on them ' 

Fie threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it. 

'Only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of Rohan,' 
laughed Legolas. 'You will make a rider yet.' 

'It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance,' said Gimli. 

'If you wish to know what I think,' he began again after a while 'I 
think it was Saruman. Who else? Remember the words of Jomer: he walks 
about 

like an old man hooded and cloaked. Those were the words. He has gone off 
with our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. There is more trouble 
coming to us, mark my words!' 

'I mark them,' said Aragorn. 'But I marked also that this old man had a 
hat not a hood. Still I do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are 
in peril here, by night or day. Yet in the meantime there is nothing that we 
can do but rest, while we may. I will watch for a while now, Gimli. I have 
more need of thought than of sleep.' 

The night passed slowly. Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli followed 
Legolas, and their watches wore away. But nothing happened. The old man did 
not appear again, and the horses did not return. 




Chapter 3 . The Uruk-Hai 



Pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear 
his own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling Frodo, Frodo ! But 
instead of Frodo hundreds of hideous ore-faces grinned at him out of the 
shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side. Where 
was 
Merry? 

He woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back. Evening 
was coming and the sky above was growing dim. He turned and found that the 
dream was little worse than the waking. His wrists, legs, and ankles were 
tied with cords. Beside him Merry lay, white-faced, with a dirty rag bound 
across his brows. All about them sat or stood a great company of Ores. 

Slowly in Pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became 
separated from dream-shadows. Of course: he and Merry had run off into the 
woods. What had come over them? Why had they dashed off like that, taking 
no 

notice of old Strider? They had run a long way shouting— he could not 
remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right into 
a group of Ores: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to 
see Merry and Pippin until they were almost in their arms. Then they yelled 
and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. Merry and he had 
drawn their swords, but the Ores did not wish to fight, and had tried only 
to lay hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several of their arms and 
hands. Good old Merry! 

Then Boromir had come leaping through the trees. He had made them 
fight. He slew many of them and the rest fled. But they had not gone far on 
the way back when they were attacked again, by a hundred Ores at least, some 
of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at Boromir. 
Boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at first the Ores 
had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes 
came, they had attacked more fierce than ever. Pippin did not remember much 
more. His last memo was of Boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an 
arrow; then darkness fell suddenly. 

'I suppose I was knocked on the head,' he said to himself. 'I wonder if 




poor Merry is much hurt. What has happened to Boromir? Why didn’t the 
Ores 

kill us? Where are we, and where are we going?' 

He could not answer the questions. He felt cold and sick. 'I wish 
Gandalf had never persuaded Elrond to let us come,' he thought. ’What good 
have I been? Just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. And now I 
have been stolen and I am just a piece of luggage for the Ores. I hope 
Strider or someone will come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won't 
that throw out all the plans? I wish I could get free!' 

He struggled a little, quite uselessly. One of the Ores sitting near 
laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue. 'Rest 
while you can, little fool!' he said then to Pippin, in the Common Speech, 
which he made almost as hideous as his own language. 'Rest while you can! 
We'll find a use for your legs before long. You'll wish you had got none 
before we get home.' 

'If I had my way, you'd wish you were dead now,' said the other. 'I'd 
make you squeak, you miserable rat.' He stooped over Pippin bringing his 
yellow fangs close to his face. He had a black knife with a long jagged 
blade in his hand. 'Lie quiet, or I'll tickle you with this,' he hissed. 

'Don't draw attention to yourself, or I may forget my orders. Curse the 
Isengarders! Ugl®k u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob b®bhosh skai' 
he 

passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into 
muttering and snarling. 

Terrified Pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and ankles 
was growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. To take 
his mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear. There 
were many voices round about, and though ore-speech sounded at all times 
full of hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had 
begun, and was getting hotter. 

To Pippin's surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible 
many of the Ores were using ordinary language. Apparently the members of 
two 

or three quite different tribes were present, and they could not understand 
one another's ore-speech. There was an angry debate concerning what they 
were to do now: which way they were to take and what should be done with the 
prisoners. 




'There's no time to kill them properly,' said one. 'No time for play on 
this trip.' 

'That can't be helped,' said another. 'But why not kill them quick, 
kill them now? They're a cursed nuisance, and we're in a hurry. Evening's 
coming on, and we ought to get a move on.' 

'Orders.' said a third voice in a deep growl. 'Kill all but NOT the 
Halfings; they are to be brought back ALIVE as quickly as possible. That's 
my orders.' 

'What are they wanted for?' asked several voices. 'Why alive? Do they 
give good sport?' 

'No! I heard that one of them has got something, something that's 
wanted for the War, some elvish plot or other. Anyway they'll both be 
questioned.' 

'Is that all you know? Why don't we search them and find out? We might 
find something that we could use ourselves.' 

'That is a very interesting remark,' sneered a voice, softer than the 
others but more evil. 'I may have to report that. The prisoners are NOT to 
be searched or plundered: those are my orders.' 

'And mine too,' said the deep voice. 'Alive and as captured; no 
spoiling. That's my orders.' 

'Not our orders!' said one of the earlier voices. 'We have come all the 
way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go 
back north.' 

'Then you can wish again,' said the growling voice. 'I am Ugl®k. I 
command. I return to Isengard by the shortest road.' 

'Is Saruman the master or the Great Eye?' said the evil voice. 'We 
should go back at once to Lugb®rz.' 

'If we could cross the Great River, we might,' said another voice. 'But 
there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges.' 

'I came across,' said the evil voice. 'A winged Nazgyl awaits us 
northward on the east -bank.' 

'Maybe, maybe! Then you'll fly off with our prisoners, and get all the 
pay and praise in Lugb®rz, and leave us to foot it as best we can through 
the Horse-country. No, we must stick together. These lands are dangerous: 
full of foul rebels and brigands.' 

'Aye, we must stick together,' growled Ugl®k. 'I don't trust you little 
swine. You've no guts outside your own sties. But for us you'd all have run 




away. We are the fighting Uruk-hai! We slew the great warrior. We took the 
prisoners. We are the servants of Saruman the Wise, the White Hand: the Hand 
that gives us man’s-flesh to eat. We came out of Isengard, and led you here, 
and we shall lead you back by the way we choose. I am UgKDk. I have spoken.' 

'You have spoken more than enough, UgKDk,' sneered the evil voice. 'I 
wonder how they would like it in Lugb(Drz. They might think that Ugl®k's 
shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head. They might ask where his 
strange ideas came from. Did they come from Saruman, perhaps? Who does 
he 

think he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white badges? They might 
agree with me, with Grishnbkh their trusted messenger; and I Grishnbkh say 
this: Saruman is a fool, and a dirty treacherous fool. But the Great Eye is 
on him. 

'Swine is it? How do you folk like being called swine by the 
muck-rakers of a dirty little wizard? It's ore-flesh they eat, I'll 
warrant.' 

Many loud yells in ore-speech answered him, and the ringing clash of 
weapons being drawn. Cautiously Pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would 
happen. His guards had gone to join in the fray. In the twilight he saw a 
large black Ore, probably Ugl®k, standing facing Grishnbkh, a short 
crook -legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the 
ground. Round them were many smaller goblins. Pippin supposed that these 
were the ones from the North. They had drawn their knives and swords, but 
hesitated to attack Ugl®k. 

Ugl®k shouted, and a number of other Ores of nearly his own size ran 
up. Then suddenly, without warning, Ugl®k sprang forwards, and with two 
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents. Grishnbkh stepped 
aside and vanished into the shadows. The others gave way, and one stepped 
backwards and fell over Merry's prostrate form with a curse. Yet that 
probably saved his life, for Ugl®k's followers leaped over him and cut down 
another with their broad-bladed swords. It was the yellow-fanged guard. His 
body fell right on top of Pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife. 

'Put up your weapons!' shouted Ugl®k. 'And let's have no more nonsense! 
We go straight west from here, and down the stair. From there straight to 
the downs, then along the river to the forest. And we march day and night. 
That clear?' 

'Now,' thought Pippin, 'if only it takes that ugly fellow a little 




while to get his troop under control, I've got a chance.’ A gleam of hope 
had come to him. The edge of the black knife had snicked his arm, and then 
slid down to his wrist. He felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he 
also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin. 

The Ores were getting ready to march again, but some of the Northerners 
were still unwilling, and the Isengarders slew two more before the rest were 
cowed. There was much cursing and confusion. For the moment Pippin was 
unwatched. His legs were securely bound, but his arms were only tied about 
the wrists, and his hands were in front of him. He could move them both 
together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead Ore to one 
side, then hardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up 
and down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held 
it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers and knotted 
it again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands. 

Then he lay very still. 

'Pick up those prisoners!' shouted Ugl®k. 'Don't play any tricks with 
them! If they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.' 

An Ore seized Pippin like a sack, put its head between his tied hands, 
grabbed his arms and dragged them down, until Pippin's face was crushed 
against its neck; then it jolted off with him. Another treated Merry in the 
same way. The Ore's clawlike hand gripped Pippin's arms like iron; the nails 
bit into him. He shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams. 

Suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was early night, 
but the slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the edge of a 
cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. There was a sound of 
water falling nearby. 

'The scouts have come back at last,' said an Ore close at hand. 

'Well, what did you discover?' growled the voice of Ugl®k. 

'Only a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All's clear now.' 

'Now, I daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have shot him. 
He'll raise the alarm. The cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning. 
Now we'll have to leg it double quick.' 

A shadow bent over Pippin. It was Ugl®k. 'Sit up!' said the Ore. 'My 
lads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down and you must 
use your legs. Be helpful now. No crying out, no trying to escape. We have 
ways of paying for tricks that you won't like, though they won't spoil your 
usefulness for the Master.' 




He cut the thongs round Pippin's legs and ankles, picked him up by his 
hair and stood him on his feet. Pippin fell down, and UgKDk dragged him up 
by his hair again. Several Ores laughed. UgKDk thrust a flask between his 
teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt a hot fierce 
glow flow through him. The pain in his legs and ankles vanished. He could 
stand. 

'Now for the other!' said UgKDk. Pippin saw him go to Merry, who was 
lying close by, and kick him. Merry groaned. Seizing him roughly UgKDk 
pulled him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. Then 
he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box. Merry 
cried out and struggled wildly. 

The Ores clapped and hooted. 'Can't take his medicine,' they jeered. 
'Doesn't know what's good for him. Ai! We shall have some fun later.' 

But at the moment UgKDk was not engaged in sport. He needed speed and 
had to humour unwilling followers. He was healing Merry in ore-fashion; and 
his treatment worked swiftly. When he had forced a drink from his flask down 
the hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to his feet, Merry 
stood up, looking pale but grim and defiant, and very much alive. The gash 
in his forehead gave him no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the 
end of his days. 

'Hullo, Pippin!' he said. 'So you've come on this little expedition, 
too? Where do we get bed and breakfast?' 

'Now then!' said UgKDk. 'None of that! Hold your tongues. No talk to 
one another. Any trouble will be reported at the other end, and He'll know 
how to pay you. You'll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can 
stomach.' 

The ore -band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the 
misty plain below. Merry and Pippin, separated by a dozen Ores or more, 
climbed down with them. At the bottom they stepped on to grass, and the 
hearts of the hobbits rose. 

'Now straight on!' shouted UgKDk. 'West and a little north. Follow 
Lugdush.' 

'But what are we going to do at sunrise?' said some of the Northerners. 

'Go on running,' said UgKDk. 'What do you think? Sit on the grass and 
wait for the Whiteskins to join the picnic?' 

'But we can't run in the sunlight.' 

'You'll run with me behind you,' said UgKDk. 'Run! Or you'll never see 




your beloved holes again. By the White Hand! What's the use of sending out 
mountain-maggots on a trip, only half trained. Run, curse you! Run while 
night lasts!' 

Then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of 
Ores. They kept no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed 
was very great. Each hobbit had a guard of three. Pippin was far back in the 
line. He wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had 
had no food since the morning. One of his guards had a whip. But at present 
the ore-liquor was still hot in him. His wits, too, were wide-awake. 

Every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the 
keen face of Strider bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind. 

But what could even a Ranger see except a confused trail of ore-feet? His 
own little prints and Merry's were overwhelmed by the trampling of the 
iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them. 

They had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped 
down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. Mist 
lay there, pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon. The dark 
shapes of the Ores in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up. 

'Ai! Steady now!' shouted UgKDk from the rear. 

A sudden thought leaped into Pippin's mind, and he acted on it at once. 

He swerved aside to the right, and dived out of the reach of his clutching 
guard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on the grass. 

'Halt!' yelled UgKDk. 

There was for a moment turmoil and confusion. Pippin sprang up and ran. 
But the Ores were after him. Some suddenly loomed up right in front of him. 

'No hope of escape!' thought Pippin. 'But there is a hope that I have 
left some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground.' He groped with his 
two tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the brooch of his cloak. Just as 
long arms and hard claws seized him. he let it fall. 'There I suppose it 
will lie until the end of time,' he thought. 'I don't know why I did it. If 
the others have escaped, they've probably all gone with Frodo.' 

A whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry. 

'Enough!' shouted UgKDk running up. 'He's still got to run a long way 
yet. Make 'em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.' 

'But that's not all,' he snarled, turning to Pippin. 'I shan't forget. 

Payment is only put off. Leg it!' 

Neither Pippin nor Merry remembered much of the later part of the 




journey. Evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of 
misery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. They ran, and they ran, 
striving to keep up the pace set by the Ores, licked every now and again 
with a cruel thong cunningly handled. If they halted or stumbled, they were 
seized and dragged for some distance. 

The warmth of the ore-draught had gone. Pippin felt cold and sick 
again. Suddenly he fell face downward on the turf. Hard hands with rending 
nails gripped and lifted him. He was carried like a sack once more, and 
darkness grew about him: whether the darkness of another night, or a 
blindness of his eyes, he could not tell. 

Dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that many of the 
Ores were demanding a halt. UgKDk was shouting. He felt himself flung to the 
ground, and he lay as he fell, till black dreams took him. But he did not 
long escape from pain; soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him 
again. For a long time he was tossed and shaken, and then slowly the 
darkness gave way, and he came back to the waking world and found that it 
was morning. Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass. 

There he lay for a while, fighting with despair. His head swam, but 
from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught. 
An Ore stooped over him, and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried 
flesh. He ate the stale grey bread hungrily, but not the meat. He was 
famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an Ore, the 
flesh of he dared not guess what creature. 

He sat up and looked about. Merry was not far away. They were by the 
banks of a swift narrow river. Ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was 
catching the first rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on the lower 
slopes before them. 

There was much shouting and debating among the Ores; a quarrel seemed 
on the point of breaking out again between the Northerners and the 
Isengarders. Some were pointing back away south, and some were pointing 
eastward. 

'Very well,' said UgKDk. 'Leave them to me then! No killing, as I've 
told you before; but if you want to throw away what we’ve come all the way 
to get, throw it away ! I'll look after it. Let the fighting Uruk-hai do the 
work, as usual. If you're afraid of the Whiteskins, run! Run! There's the 
forest,' he shouted, pointing ahead. 'Get to it! It's your best hope. Off 
you go ! And quick, before I knock a few more heads off, to put some sense 




into the others.' 

There was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the Northerners 
broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running wildly along the 
river towards the mountains. The hobbits were left with the Isengarders: a 
grim dark band, four score at least of large, swart, slant-eyed Ores with 
great bows and short broad-bladed swords. A few of the larger and bolder 
Northerners remained with them. 

'Now we'll deal with Grishnbkh,' said Ugl®k; but some even of his own 
followers were looking uneasily southwards. 

'I know,' growled Ugl®k. 'The cursed horse-boys have got wind of us. 

But that' s all your fault, Snaga. You and the other scouts ought to have 
your ears cut off. But we are the fighters. We'll feast on horseflesh yet, 
or something better.' 

At that moment Pippin saw why some of the troop had been pointing 
eastward. From that direction there now came hoarse cries, and there was 
Grishnbkh again, and at his back a couple of score of others like him: 
long-armed crook-legged Ores. They had a red eye painted on their shields. 
Ugl®k stepped forward to meet them. 'So you've come back?' he said. 'Thought 
better of it, eh?' 

'I've returned to see that Orders are carried out and the prisoners 
safe,' answered Grishnbkh. 

'Indeed!' said Ugl®k. 'Waste of effort. Ill see that orders are 
carried out in my command. And what else did you come back for? You went 
in 

a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?' 

'I left a fool,' snarled Grishnbkh. 'But there were some stout fellows 
with him that are too good to lose. I knew you'd lead them into a mess. I've 
come to help them.' 

'Splendid!' laughed Ugl®k. 'But unless you've got some guts for 
fighting, you've taken the wrong way. Lugb®rz was your road. The 
Whiteskins 

are coming. What's happened to your precious Nazgyl? Has he had another 
mount shot under him? Now, if you'd brought him along, that might have been 
useful-if these Nazgyl are all they make out.' 

'Nazgyl, Nazgyl,' said Grishnbkh, shivering and licking his lips, as if 
the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. 'You speak of what is 
deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, Ugl®k,' he said. 'Nazgyl! Ah! 




All that they make out! One day you'll wish that you had not said that. 
Ape!' he snarled fiercely. 'You ought to know that they're the apple of the 
Great Eye. But the winged Nazgyl: not yet, not yet. He won't let them show 
themselves across the Great River yet, not too soon. They're for the War -and 
other purposes.' 

'You seem to know a lot,' said Ugl®k. 'More than is good for you, I 
guess. Perhaps those in Lugb®rz might wonder how, and why. But in the 
meantime the Uruk-hai of Isengard can do the dirty work, as usual. Don't 
stand slavering there! Get your rabble together! The other swine are legging 
it to the forest. You'd better follow. You wouldn't get back to the Great 
River alive. Right off the mark! Now! I'll be on your heels.' 

The Isengarders seized Merry and Pippin again and slung them on their 
backs. Then the troop started off. Hour after hour they ran, pausing now and 
again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers. Either because they were 
quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of Grishnbkh's, the Isengarders 
gradually passed through the Ores of Mordor, and Grishnbkh's folk closed in 
behind. Soon they were gaining also on the Northerners ahead. The forest 
began to draw nearer. 

Pippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was grated by the filthy 
jowl and hairy ear of the Ore that held him. Immediately in front were bowed 
backs, and tough thick legs going up and down, up and down, unresting, as if 
they were made of wire and horn, beating out the nightmare seconds of an 
endless time. 

In the afternoon Ugl®k's troop overtook the Northerners. They were 
flagging in the rays of the bright sun, winter sun shining in a pale cool 
sky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out. 

'Maggots!' jeered the Isengarders. 'You're cooked. The Whiteskins will 
catch you and eat you. They're coming!' 

A cry from Grishnbkh showed that this was not mere jest. Horsemen, 
riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind, but gaining 
on the Ores, gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in 
a quicksand. 

The Isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that astonished 
Pippin, a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race. Then he saw that 
the sun was sinking, falling behind the Misty Mountains; shadows reached 
over the land. The soldiers of Mordor lifted their heads and also began to 
put on speed. The forest was dark and close. Already they had passed a few 




outlying trees. The land was beginning to slope upwards, ever more steeply; 
but the Ores did not halt. Both Ugl®k and Grishnbkh shouted, spurring them 
on to a last effort. 

'They will make it yet. They will escape,' thought Pippin. And then he 
managed to twist his neck, so as to glance back with one eye over his 
shoulder. He saw that riders away eastward were already level with the Ores, 
galloping over the plain. The sunset gilded their spears and helmets, and 
glinted in their pale flowing hair. They were hemming the Ores in, 
preventing them from scattering, and driving them along the line of the 
river. 

He wondered very much what kind of folk they were. He wished now that 
he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in 
those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands, 
and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or from Strider, 
and even from Frodo. All that he could remember about Rohan was that 
Gandalf s horse, Shadowfax, had come from that land. That sounded hopeful, 
as far as it went. 

'But how will they know that we are not Ores?' he thought. 'I don't 
suppose they've ever heard of hobbits down here. I suppose I ought to be 
glad that the beastly Ores look like being destroyed, but I would rather be 
saved myself.' The chances were that he and Merry would be killed together 
with their captors, before ever the Men of Rohan were aware of them. 

A few of the riders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting from a 
running horse. Riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the Ores that 
straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out 
of the range of the answering bows of their enemies, who shot wildly, not 
daring to halt. This happened many times, and on one occasion arrows fell 
among the Isengarders. One of them, just in front of Pippin, stumbled and 
did not get up again. 

Night came down without the Riders closing in for battle. Many Ores had 
fallen, but fully two hundred remained. In the early darkness the Ores came 
to a hillock. The eaves of the forest were very near, probably no more than 
three furlongs away, but they could go no further. The horsemen had 
encircled them. A small band disobeyed UgKDk's command, and ran on 
towards 

the forest: only three returned. 

'Well, here we are,' sneered Grishnbkh. 'Fine leadership! I hope the 




great Ugl®k will lead us out again.' 

'Put those Halflings down!’ ordered Ugl®k, taking no notice of 
Grishnbkh. ’You, Lugdush, get two others and stand guard over them! They're 
not to be killed, unless the filthy Whiteskins break through. Understand? As 
long as I'm alive, I want 'em. But they're not to cry out, and they're not 
to be rescued. Bind their legs!' 

The last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. But Pippin 
found that for the first time he was close to Merry. The Ores were making a 
great deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons, and the hobbits 
managed to whisper together for a while. 

'I don't think much of this,' said Merry. 'I feel nearly done in. Don't 
think I could crawl away far, even if I was free.' 

'Lembas!' whispered Pippin. 'Lembas: I've got some. Have you? I don't 
think they've taken anything but our swords.' 

'Yes, I had a packet in my pocket,' answered Merry, 'but it must be 
battered to crumbs. Anyway I can't put my mouth in my pocket!' 

'You won't have to. I've—'; but just then a savage kick warned Pippin 
that the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful. 

The night was cold and still. All round the knoll on which the Ores 
were gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness, a 
complete ring of them. They were within a long bowshot, but the riders did 
not show themselves against the light, and the Ores wasted many arrows 
shooting at the fires, until Ugl®k stopped them. The riders made no sound. 
Later in the night when the moon came out of the mist, then occasionally 
they could be seen, shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the white 
light, as they moved in ceaseless patrol. 

'They'll wait for the Sun, curse them!' growled one of the guards. 'Why 
don't we get together and charge through? What's old Ugl®k think he's doing, 

I should like to know?' 

'I daresay you would,' snarled Ugl®k stepping up from behind. Meaning 
I don't think at all, eh? Curse you! You're as bad as the other rabble: the 
maggots and the apes of Lugb®rz. No good trying to charge with them. They'd 
just squeal and bolt, and there are more than enough of these filthy 
horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat. 

'There's only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets 
in the dark. But these Whiteskins have better night-eyes than most Men, from 
all I've heard; and don't forget their horses! They can see the 




night-breeze, or so it's said. Still there's one thing the fine fellows 
don't know: Mauh®r and his lads are in the forest, and they should turn up 
any time now.' 

Ugl®k's words were enough, apparently, to satisfy the Isengarders; but 
the other Ores were both dispirited and rebellious. They posted a few 
watchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the pleasant 
darkness. It did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward 
into thick cloud, and Pippin could not see anything a few feet away. The 
fires brought no light to the hillock. The riders were not, however, content 
merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcry on 
the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. It seemed that 
some of the Men had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to 
the edge of the camp and killed several Ores, and then had faded away again. 
Ugl®k dashed off to stop a stampede. 

Pippin and Merry sat up. Their guards, Isengarders, had gone with 
Ugl®k. But if the hobbits had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. A 
long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together. 
Dimly they were aware of Grishnbkh's great head and hideous face between 
them; his foul breath was on their cheeks. He began to paw them and feel 
them. Pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back. 

'Well, my little ones!' said Grishnbkh in a soft whisper. 'Enjoying 
your nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps: swords and whips 
on one side, and nasty spears on the other! Little people should not meddle 
_in affairs that are too big for them.' His fingers continued to grope. 

There was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes. 

The thought came suddenly into Pippin's mind, as if caught direct from 
the urgent thought of his enemy: 'Grishnbkh knows about the Ring! He's 
looking for it, while Ugl®k is busy: he probably wants it for himself.' Cold 
fear was in Pippin's heart, yet at the same time he was wondering what use 
he could make of Grishnbkh's desire. 

'I don't think you will find it that way,' he whispered. 'It isn't easy 
to find.' 

' Find it?' said Grishnbkh: his fingers stopped crawling and gripped 
Pippin's shoulder. 'Find what? What are you talking about, little one?'. For 
a moment Pippin was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in 
his throat: gollum, go llum. 'Nothing, my precious,' he added. 

The hobbits felt Grishnbkh's fingers twitch. 'O ho!' hissed the goblin 




softly. ’That's what he means, is it? O ho! Very ve-ry dangerous, my little 
ones.' 

’Perhaps,' said Merry, now alert and aware of Pippin’s guess. 'Perhaps; 
and not only for us. Still you know your own business best. Do you want it, 
or not? And what would you give for it?' 

'Do I want it? Do I want it?' said Grishnbkh, as if puzzled; but his 
arms were trembling. 'What would I give for it? What do you mean?' 

'We mean,' said Pippin, choosing his words carefully, 'that it's no 
good groping in the dark. We could save you time and trouble. But you must 
untie our legs first, or we'll do nothing, and say nothing.' 

'My dear tender little fools,' hissed Grishnbkh, 'everything you have, 
and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time: everything! 
You'll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the Questioner, 
indeed you will: quite soon. We shan't hurry the enquiry. Oh dear no! What 
do you think you've been kept alive for? My dear little fellows, please 
believe me when I say that it was not out of kindness: that's not even one 
of UgKDk's faults.' 

'I find it quite easy to believe,' said Merry. 'But you haven't got 
your prey home yet. And it doesn't seem to be going your way, whatever 
happens. If we come to Isengard, it won't be the great Grishnbkh that 
benefits: Saruman will take all that he can find. If you want anything for 
yourself, now's the time to do a deal.' 

Grishnbkh began to lose his temper. The name of Saruman seemed 
specially to enrage him. Time was passing and the disturbance was dying 
down. Ugl®k or the Isengarders might return at any minute. 

'Have you got it — either of you?' he snarled. 

'Gollum, go llum!' said Pippin. 

'Untie our legs!' said Merry. 

They felt the Ore's arms trembling violently. 'Curse you, you filthy 
little vermin!' he hissed. 'Untie your legs? I'll untie every string in your 
bodies. Do you think I can't search you to the bones? Search you! I'll cut 
you both to quivering shreds. I don't need the help of your legs to get you 
away-and have you all to myself!' 

Suddenly he seized them. The strength in his long arms and shoulders 
was terrifying. He tucked them one under each armpit, and crushed them 
fiercely to his sides; a great stifling hand was clapped over each of their 
mouths. Then he sprang forward, stooping low. Quickly and silently he went, 




until he came to the edge of the knoll. There, choosing a gap between the 
watchers, he passed like an evil shadow out into the night, down the slope 
and away westward towards the river that flowed out of the forest. In that 
direction there was a wide open space with only one fire. 

After going a dozen yards he halted, peering and listening. Nothing 
could be seen or heard. He crept slowly on, bent almost double. Then he 
squatted and listened again. Then he stood up, as if to risk a sudden dash. 

At that very moment the dark form of a rider loomed up right in front of 
him. A horse snorted and reared. A man called out. 

Grishnbkh flung himself on the ground flat, dragging the hobbits under 
him; then he drew his sword. No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather 
than allow them to escape or to be rescued; but it was his undoing. The 
sword rang faintly, and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to 
his left. An arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill, 
or guided by fate, and it pierced his right hand. He dropped the sword and 
shrieked. There was a quick beat of hoofs, and even as Grishnbkh leaped up 
and ran, he was ridden down and a spear passed through him. He gave a 
hideous shivering cry and lay still. 

The hobbits remained flat on the ground, as Grishnbkh had left them. 
Another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade's aid. Whether because 
of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse 
lifted and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did not see them, lying 
covered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to 
move. 

At last Merry stirred and whispered softly: 'So far so good: but how 
are we to avoid being spitted?’ 

The answer came almost immediately. The cries of Grishnbkh had roused 
the Ores. From the yells and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits 
guessed that their disappearance had been discovered: Ugl®k was probably 
knocking off a few more heads. Then suddenly the answering cries of 
ore-voices came from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the 
direction of the forest and the mountains. Mauh®r had apparently arrived and 
was attacking the besiegers. There was the sound of galloping horses. The 
Riders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll, risking the 
ore-arrows, so as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to deal 
with the newcomers. Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized that without moving 
they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape. 




'Now,' said Merry, 'if only we had our legs and hands free, we might 
get away. But I can’t touch the knots, and I can't bite them.' 

'No need to try,' said Pippin. 'I was going to tell you: I've managed 
to free my hands. These loops are only left for show. You'd better have a 
bit of lembas first.' 

He slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. The cakes 
were broken, but good, still in their leaf- wrappings. The hobbits each ate 
two or three pieces. The taste brought back to them the memory of fair 
faces, and laughter, and wholesome food in quiet days now far away. For a 
while they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the dark, heedless of the cries and 
sounds of battle nearby. Pippin was the first to come back to the present. 

'We must be off,' he said. 'Half a moment!' Grishnbkh's sword was lying 
close at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled 
forward, and finding the body of the goblin he drew from its sheath a long 
sharp knife. With this he quickly cut their bonds. 

'Now for it!' he said. 'When we've warmed up a bit, perhaps we shall be 
able to stand again, and walk. But in any case we had better start by 
crawling.' 

They crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped them: but 
it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide berth, and 
wormed their way forward bit by bit, until they came to the edge of the 
river, gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks. Then they 
looked back. 

The sounds had died away. Evidently Mauh®r and his 'lads' had been 
killed or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. 

It would not last very much longer. Already the night was old. In the East, 
which had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale. 

'We must get under cover,' said Pippin, 'or we shall be seen. It will 
not be any comfort to us, if these riders discover that we are not Ores 
after we are dead.' He got up and stamped his feet. 'Those cords have cut me 
like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. I could stagger on now. What 
about you, Merry?' 

Merry got up. 'Yes,' he said, 'I can manage it. Lembas does put heart 
into you! A more wholesome sort of feeling, too, than the heat of that 
ore-draught. I wonder what it was made of. Better not to know, I expect. 
Let's get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it!' 

'Not here, the banks are too steep,' said Pippin. 'Forward now!' 




They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river. 
Behind them the light grew in the East. As they walked they compared notes, 
talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since 
their capture. No listener would have guessed from their words that they had 
suffered cruelly, and been in dire peril, going without hope towards torment 
and death; or that even now, as they knew well, they had little chance of 
ever finding friend or safety again. 

'You seem to have been doing well, Master Took,' said Merry. 'You will 
get almost a chapter in old Bilbo's book, if ever I get a chance to report 
to him. Good work: especially guessing that hairy villain's little game, and 
playing up to him. But I wonder if anyone will ever pick up your trail and 
find that brooch. I should hate to lose mine, but I am afraid yours is gone 
for good. 

'I shall have to brush up my toes, if I am to get level with you. 

Indeed Cousin Brandybuck is going in front now. This is where he comes in. I 
don't suppose you have much notion where we are; but I spent my time at 
Rivendell rather better. We are walking west along the Entwash. The butt-end 
of the Misty Mountains is in front, and Fangorn Forest.' 

Even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before 
them. Night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away 
from the coming Dawn. 

'Lead on, Master Brandybuck!' said Pippin. 'Or lead back! We have been 
warned against Fangorn. But one so knowing will not have forgotten that.' 

'I have not,' answered Merry; 'but the forest seems better to me, all 
the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.' 

He led the way in under the huge branches of the trees. Old beyond 
guessing, they seemed. Great trailing beards of lichen hung from them, 
blowing and swaying in the breeze. Out of the shadows the hobbits peeped, 
gazing back down the slope: little furtive figures that in the dim light 
looked like elf-children in the deeps of time peering out of the Wild Wood 
in wonder at their first Dawn. 

Far over the Great River, and the Brown Lands, leagues upon grey 
leagues away, the Dawn came, red as flame. Loud rang the hunting-horns to 
greet it. The Riders of Rohan sprang suddenly to life. Horn answered horn 
again. 

Merry and Pippin heard, clear in the cold air, the neighing of 
war-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. The Sun's limb was lifted, 




an arc of fire, above the margin of the world. Then with a great cry the 
Riders charged from the East; the red light gleamed on mail and spear. The 
Ores yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. The hobbits saw 
several horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over it, and 
wheeled round and charged again. Most of the raiders that were left alive 
then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. But 
one band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the 
direction of the forest. Straight up the slope they charged towards the 
watchers. Now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain that they would 
escape: they had already hewn down three Riders that barred their way. 

'We have watched too long,' said Merry. 'There's Ugl®k! I don't want to 
meet him again.' The hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the 
wood. 

So it was that they did not sec the last stand, when Ugl®k was 
overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he was slain 
at last by Jomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, who dismounted and fought 
him sword to sword. And over the wide fields the keen-eyed Riders hunted 
down the few Ores that had escaped and still had strength to fly. 

Then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung 
their praises, the Riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their 
enemies. So ended the raid, and no news of it came ever back either to 
Mordor or to Isengard; but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and 
was seen by many watchful eyes. 




Chapter 4 . Treebeard 



Meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled 
forest allowed, following the line of the running stream, westward and up 
towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into Fangorn. Slowly 
their fear of the Ores died away, and their pace slackened. A queer stifling 
feeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for 
breathing. 

At last Merry halted. 'We can't go on like this,' he panted. 'I want 
some air.' 

'Let's have a drink at any rate,' said Pippin. 'I'm parched.' He 
clambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and 
stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. It was clear and cold, and 
he took many draughts. Merry followed him. The water refreshed them and 
seemed to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of 
the stream, dabbling their sore feet and legs, and peering round at the 
trees that stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away 
into grey twilight in every direction. 

'I suppose you haven't lost us already?' said Pippin, leaning back 
against a great tree-trunk. 'We can at least follow the course of this 
stream, the Entwash or whatever you call it, and get out again the way we 
came.' 

'We could, if our legs would do it,' said Merry; 'and if we could 
breathe properly.' 

'Yes, it is all very dim, and stuffy, in here,' said Pippin. 'It 
reminds me, somehow, of the old room in the Great Place of the Tooks away 
back in the Smials at Tuckborough: a huge place, where the furniture has 
never been moved or changed for generations. They say the Old Took lived in 
it year after year, while he and the room got older and shabbier 
together-and it has never changed since he died, a century ago. And Old 
Gerontius was my great-great-grandfather: that puts it back a bit. But that 
is nothing to the old feeling of this wood. Look at all those weeping, 
trailing, beards and whiskers of lichen! And most of the trees seem to be 
half covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen. Untidy. I can't 
imagine what spring would look like here, if it ever comes; still less a 
spring-cleaning.' 




'But the Sun at any rate must peep in sometimes.' said Merry. 'It does 
not look or feel at all like Bilbo's description of Mirkwood. That was all 
dark and black, and the home of dark black things. This is just dim, and 
frightfully tree-ish. You can't imagine animals living here at all, or 
staying for long.' 

'No, nor hobbits,' said Pippin. 'And I don't like the thought of trying 
to get through it either. Nothing to cat for a hundred miles, I should 
guess. How are our supplies?' 

'Low,' said Merry. 'We ran off with nothing but a couple of spare 
packets of lembas, and left everything else behind.' They looked at what 
remained of the elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five meagre days, 
that was all. 'And not a wrap or a blanket,' said Merry. 'We shall be cold 
tonight, whichever way we go.' 

'Well, we'd better decide on the way now,' said Pippin. 'The morning 
must be getting on.' 

Just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared, some 
way further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have 
pierced the forest -roof. 

'Hullo!' said Merry. 'The Sun must have run into a cloud while we've 
been under these trees, and now she has run out again; or else she has 
climbed high enough to look down through some opening. It isn't far let's go 
and investigate!' 

They found it was further than they thought. The ground was rising 
steeply still, and it was becoming increasingly stony. The light grew 
broader as they went on, and soon they saw that there was a rock -wall before 
them: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by 
the distant mountains. No trees grew on it, and the sun was falling full on 
its stony face. The twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff 
and still, as if reaching out to the warmth. Where all had looked so shabby 
and grey before, the wood now gleamed with rich browns, and with the 
smooth 

black-greys of bark like polished leather. The boles of the trees glowed 
with a soft green like young grass: early spring or a fleeting vision of it 
was about them. 

In the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural 
perhaps, and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock, for it was 
rough and uneven. High up, almost level with the tops of forest-trees, there 




was a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at 
its edge, and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left: it 
looked almost like the figure of some gnarled old man, standing there, 
blinking in the morning -light. 

'Up we go!' said Merry joyfully. 'Now for a breath of air, and a sight 
of the land!' 

They climbed and scrambled up the rock. If the stair had been made it 
was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs. They were too eager to be 
surprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their 
captivity had healed and their vigour had returned. They came at length to 
the edge of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang 
up and turned round with their backs to the hill, breathing deep, and 
looking out eastward. They saw that they had only come some three or four 
miles into the forest: the heads of the trees marched down the slopes 
towards the plain. There, near the fringe of the forest, tall spires of 
curling black smoke went up, wavering and floating towards them. 

’The wind's changing,' said Merry. ’It’s turned east again. It feels 
cool up here.' 

'Yes,' said Pippin; 'I'm afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it 
will all go grey again. What a pity! This shaggy old forest looked so 
different in the sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place.’ 

’Almost felt you liked the Forest! That's good! That's uncommonly kind 
of you,' said a strange voice. 'Turn round and let me have a look at your 
faces. I almost feel that I dislike you both, but do not let us be hasty. 

Turn round!' A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders, 
and they were twisted round, gently but irresistibly; then two great arms 
lifted them up. 

They found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It 
belonged to a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen 
foot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it 
was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, 
was difficult to say. At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the 
trunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large 
feet had seven toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a 
sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at 
the ends. But at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes. These 
deep eyes were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. 




They were brown, shot with a green light. Often afterwards Pippin tried to 
describe his first impression of them. 

'One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with 
ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was 
sparkling with the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a 
vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake. I don’t know but it felt 
as if something that grew in the ground-asleep, you might say, or just 
feeling itself as something between roof-tip and leaf-tip, between deep 
earth and sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same 
slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years.' 

'Hrum, Hoorn,' murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep 
woodwind instrument. 'Very odd indeed! Do not be hasty, that is my motto. 
But if I had seen you, before I heard your voices-I liked them: nice little 
voices: they reminded me of something I cannot remember— if I had seen you 
before I heard you, I should have just trodden on you, taking you for little 
Ores, and found out my mistake afterwards. Very odd you are, indeed. Root 
and twig, very odd!' 

Pippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. Under those eyes he 
felt a curious suspense, but not fear. 'Please.' he said, 'who are you? And 
what are you?' 

A queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells 
were covered over. 'Hrum, now,' answered the voice; 'well, I am an Ent, or 
that's what they call me. Yes, Ent is the word. The Ent, I am, you might 
say, in your manner of speaking. Fangorn is my name according to some, 
Treebeard others make it. Treebeard will do.' 

'An EntT said Merry. 'What's that? But what do you call yourself? 

What's your real name?' 

'Hoo now!' replied Treebeard. 'Hoo! Now that would be telling! Not so 
hasty. And / am doing the asking. You are in my country. What are you, I 
wonder? I cannot place you. You do not seem to come in the old lists that I 
learned when I was young. But that was a long, long time ago, and they may 
have made new lists. Let me see! Let me see! Plow did it go? 

Learn now the lore of Living Creatures! 

First name the four, the free peoples: 

Eldest of all, the elf-children; 

Dwarf the delver, dark are his houses; 

Ent the earthborn, old as mountains; 




Man the mortal, master of horses: 

Hm, hm, hm. 

Beaver the builder, buck the leaper, 

Bear bee-hunter, boar the fighter; 

Hound is hungry, hare is fearful... 

hm, hm. 

Eagle in eyrie, ox in pasture, 

Hart horn-crowned; hawk is swiftest 

Swan the whitest, serpent coldest... 

Hoorn, hm; hoom. hm. how did it go? Room turn, room turn, roomty toom 
turn. 

It was a long list. But anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere!' 

'We always seem to have got left out of the old lists, and the old 
stories,' said Merry. 'Yet we've been about for quite a long time. We're 
hobbits' 

'Why not make a new line?' said Pippin. 

’Half-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers. 

Put us in amongst the four, next to Man (the Big People) and you've got 
it.' 

'Hm! Not bad, not bad,' said Treebeard. 'That would do. So you live in 
holes, eh? It sounds very right and proper. Who calls you hobbits, though? 
That does not sound elvish to me. Elves made all the old words: they began 
it.' 

'Nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,' said Pippin. 

'Hoom, hmm! Come now! Not so hasty! You call yourselves hobbits? But 
you should not go telling just anybody. You'll be letting out your own right 
names if you're not careful.' 

'We aren't careful about that,' said Merry. 'As a matter of fact I'm a 
Brandybuck, Meriadoc Brandybuck, though most people call me just Merry.' 

'And I'm a Took, Peregrin Took, but I'm generally called Pippin, or 
even Pip.' 

'Hm, but you are hasty folk, I see,' said Treebeard. 'I am honoured by 
your confidence; but you should not be too free all at once. There are Ents 
and Ents, you know; or there are Ents and things that look like Ents but 
ain't, as you might say. I'll call you Merry and Pippin if you please-nice 
names. For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.' A queer 
half-knowing, half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. 




’For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, 
and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real 
names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the 
Old Entish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very 
long time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it. 
unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to. 

'But now,' and the eyes became very bright and 'present', seeming to 
grow smaller and almost sharp, 'what is going on? What are you doing in it 
all? I can see and hear ( and smell and feel) a great deal from this, from 
this, from this a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-bur®ml. Excuse me: that 
is a part of my name for it; I do not know what the word is in the outside 
languages: you know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine 
mornings, and think about the Sun, and the grass beyond the wood, and the 
horses, and the clouds, and the unfolding of the world. What is going on? 
What is Gandalf up to? And these — burbrum,' he made a deep rumbling noise 
like a discord on a great organ — 'these Ores, and young Saruman down at 
Isengard? I like news. But not too quick now.' 

'There is quite a lot going on,' said Merry: 'and even if we tried to 
be quick, it would take a long time to tell. But you told us not to be 
hasty. Ought we to tell you anything so soon? Would you think it rude, if we 
asked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? And did 
you know Gandalf?' 

'Yes, I do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees ' 
said Treebeard. 'Do you know him?' 

'Yes,' said Pippin sadly, 'we did. He was a great friend, and he was 
our guide.' 

'Then I can answer your other questions,' said Treebeard. 'I am not 
going to do anything with you: not if you mean by that 'do something to you' 
without your leave. We might do some things together. I don't know about 
sides. I go my own way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. But 
you speak of Master Gandalf, as if he was in a story that had come to an 
end.' 

'Yes, we do,' said Pippin sadly. 'The story seems to be going on, but I 
am afraid Gandalf has fallen out of it.' 

'Hoo, come now!' said Treebeard. 'Hoorn, hm, ah well.' He paused, 
looking long at the hobbits: 'Hoorn, ah, well I do not know what to say. Come 
now!' 




'If you would like to hear more, said Merry, 'we will tell you. But it 
will take some time. Wouldn't you like to put us down? Couldn't we sit here 
together in the sun, while it lasts? You must be getting tired of holding us 
up.' 

'Hm, tiredl No. I am not tired. I do not easily get tired. And I do not 
sit down. I am not very, hm, bendable. But there, the Sun is going in. Let 
us leave this — did you say what you call it?' 

'Hill?' suggested Pippin. 'Shelf? Step?' suggested Merry. 

Treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully. 'Hill. Yes, that was it. But 
it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of 
the world was shaped. Never mind. Let us leave it, and go.' 

'Where shall we go?' asked Merry. 

'To my home, or one of my homes,' answered Treebeard. 

'Is it far?' 

'I do not know. You might call it far, perhaps. But what does that 
matter?' 

'Well, you see, we have lost all our belongings,' said Merry. 'We have 
only a little food.' 

'O! Hm! You need not trouble about that,' said Treebeard. 'I can give 
you a drink that will keep you green and growing for a long, long while. And 
if we decide to part company, I can set you down outside my country at any 
point you choose. Let us go!' 

Holding the hobbits gently but firmly, one in the crook of each arm, 
Treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the other, and moved them 
to the edge of the shelf. The rootlike toes grasped the rocks. Then 
carefully and solemnly, he stalked down from step to step, and reached the 
floor of the Forest. 

At once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees, 
deeper and deeper into the wood, never far from the stream, climbing 
steadily up towards the slopes of the mountains. Many of the trees seemed 
asleep, or as unaware of him as of any other creature that merely passed by; 
but some quivered, and some raised up their branches above his head as he 
approached. All the while, as he walked, he talked to himself in a long 
running stream of musical sounds. 

The hobbits were silent for some time. They felt, oddly enough, safe 
and comfortable, and they had a great deal to think and wonder about. At 
last Pippin ventured to speak again. 




’Please, Treebeard,' he said, ’could I ask you something? Why did 
Celeborn warn us against your forest? He told us not to risk getting 
entangled in it.' 

’Hmm, did he now?' rumbled Treebeard. 'And I might have said much the 
same, if you had been going the other way. Do not risk getting entangled in 
the woods of Laurelindurenan ! That is what the Elves used to call it, but 
now they make the name shorter: Lothlurien they call it. Perhaps they are 
right: maybe it is fading; not growing. Land of the Valley of Singing Gold, 
that was it, once upon a time. Now it is the Dreamflower. Ah well! But it is 
a queer place, and not for just any one to venture in. I am surprised that 
you ever got out, but much more surprised that you ever got in: that has not 
happened to strangers for many a year. It is a queer land. 

'And so is this. Folk have come to grief here. Aye, they have, to 
grief. Laurelindurenan lindelorendor malinornjlion ornemalin ,' he hummed to 
himself. 'They are falling rather behind the world in there, I guess,' he 
said 'Neither this country, nor anything else outside the Golden Wood, is 
what it was when Celeborn was young. Still: 

Taurelilumla-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurla Lumlanor, 1 

that is what they used to say. Things have changed, but it is still 
true in places.' 

'What do you mean?' said Pippin. 'What is true?' 

'The trees and the Ents,' said Treebeard. 'I do not understand all that 
goes on myself, so I cannot explain it to you. Some of us are still true 
Ents, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going 
tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are just trees, of course; but 
many are half awake. Some are quite wide awake, and a few are, well, ah, 
well getting Entish. That is going on all the time. 

'When that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad hearts. 
Nothing to do with their wood: I do not mean that. Why, I knew some good old 
willows down the Ent wash, gone long ago, alas! They were quite hollow, 
indeed they were falling all to pieces, but as quiet and sweet-spoken as a 
young leaf. And then there are some trees in the valleys under the 
mountains, sound as a bell, and bad right through. That sort of thing seems 
to spread. There used to be some very dangerous parts in this country. There 
are still some very black patches.' 

'Like the Old Forest away to the north, do you mean?' asked Merry. 

'Aye, aye. something like, but much worse. I do not doubt there is some 




shadow of the Great Darkness lying there still away north; and bad memories 
are handed down. But there are hollow dales in this land where the Darkness 
has never been lifted, and the trees are older than I am. Still, we do what 
we can. We keep off strangers and the foolhardy; and we train and we teach, 
we walk and we weed. 

'We are tree-herds, we old Ents. Few enough of us are left now. Sheep 
get like shepherd, and shepherds like sheep, it is said; but slowly, and 
neither have long in the world. It is quicker and closer with trees and 
Ents, and they walk down the ages together. For Ents are more like Elves: 
less interested in themselves than Men are, and better at getting inside 
other things. And yet again Ents are more like Men, more changeable than 
Elves are, and quicker at taking the colour of the outside, you might say. 

Or better than both: for they are steadier and keep their minds on things 
longer. 'Some of my kin look just like trees now, and need something great 
to rouse them; and they speak only in whispers. But some of my trees are 
limb-lithe, and many can talk to me. Elves began it, of course, waking trees 
up and teaching them to speak and learning their tree-talk. They always 
wished to talk to everything, the old Elves did. But then the Great Darkness 
came, and they passed away over the Sea, or fled into far valleys, and hid 
themselves, and made songs about days that would never come again. Never 
again. Aye, aye, there was all one wood once upon a time: from here to the 
Mountains of Lune, and this was just the East End. 

'Those were the broad days! Time was when I could walk and sing all day 
and hear no more than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills. The 
woods were like the woods of Lothlurien. only thicker stronger, younger. And 
the smell of the air! I used to spend a week just breathing.' 

Treebeard fell silent, striding along, and yet making hardly a sound 
with his great feet. Then he began to hum again, and passed into a murmuring 
chant. Gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them: 

In the willow-meads ofTasarinan I walked in the Spring. 

Ah! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion! 

And I said that was good. 

I wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of Ossiriand. 

Ah! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of Ossir! 

And I thought that was best. 

To the beeches ofNeldorethlcame in the Autumn. 

Ah! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the Autumn in 




Taur-na-neldor! 

It was more than my desire. 

To the pine-trees upon the highland of Dorthonion I climbed in the 
Winter. 

Ah! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter upon 
Orod-na-Thfn! 

My voice went up and sang in the sky. 

And now all those lands lie under the wave. 

And I walk in Ambaruna, in Tauremorna, in Aldaluml. 

In my own land, in the country of F angorn, 

Where the roots are long, 

And the years lie thicker than the leaves 

In Tauremornaluml. 

He ended, and strode on silently, and in all the wood, as far as ear 
could reach, there was not a sound. 

The day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At 
last the hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had 
come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Methedras. 
Down the hillside the young Entwash, leaping from its springs high above, 
ran noisily from step to step to meet them. On the right of the stream there 
was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew 
there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes 
between shores of cloud. 

Treebeard strode up the slope, hardly slackening his pace. Suddenly 
before them the hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees stood there, one 
on either side, like living gate-posts; but there was no gate save their 
crossing and interwoven boughs. As the old Ent approached, the trees lifted 
up their branches, and all their leaves quivered and rustled. For they were 
evergreen trees, and their leaves were dark and polished, and gleamed in the 
twilight. Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great 
hall had been cut in the side of the hill. On either hand the walls sloped 
upwards, until they were fifty feet high or more, and along each wall stood 
an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards. 

At the far end the rock-wall was sheer, but at the bottom it had been 
hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of the 
hall, save the branches of the trees, which at the inner end overshadowed 
all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle. A little stream 




escaped from the springs above, and leaving the main water, fell tinkling 
down the sheer face of the wall, pouring in silver drops, like a fine 
curtain in front of the arched bay. The water was gathered again into a 
stone basin in the floor between the trees, and thence it spilled and flowed 
away beside the open path, out to rejoin the Entwash in its journey through 
the forest. 

'Hm! Here we are!' said Treebeard, breaking his long silence. 'I have 
brought you about seventy thousand ent-strides, but what that comes to in 
the measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow we are near the roots of 
the Last Mountain. Part of the name of this place might be Wellinghall, if 
it were turned into your language. I like it. We will stay here tonight.' He 
set them down on the grass between the aisles of the trees, and they 
followed him towards the great arch. The hobbits now noticed that as he 
walked his knees hardly bent, but his legs opened in a great stride. He 
planted his big toes (and they were indeed big, and very broad) on the 
ground first, before any other part of his feet. 

For a moment Treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring, and 
took a deep breath; then he laughed, and passed inside. A great stone table 
stood there, but no chairs. At the back of the bay it was already quite 
dark. Treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table. They 
seemed to be filled with water; but he held his hands over them, and 
immediately they began to glow, one with a golden and the other with a rich 
green light; and the blending of the two lights lit the bay; as if the sun 
of summer was shining through a roof of young leaves. Looking back, the 
hobbits saw that the trees in the court had also begun to glow, faintly at 
first, but steadily quickening, until every leaf was edged with light: some 
green, some gold, some red as copper; while the tree-trunks looked like 
pillars moulded out of luminous stone. 

'Well, well, now we can talk again,' said Treebeard. 'You are thirsty I 
expect. Perhaps you are also tired. Drink this!' He went to the back of the 
bay, and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there, with heavy 
lids. He removed one of the lids, and dipped in a great ladle, and with it 
filled three bowls, one very large bowl, and two smaller ones. 

'This is an ent-house,' he said, 'and there are no seats, I fear. But 
you may sit on the table.' Picking up the hobbits he set them on the great 
stone slab, six feet above the ground, and there they sat dangling their 
legs, and drinking in sips. 




The drink was like water, indeed very like the taste of the draughts 
they had drunk from the Entwash near, the borders of the forest, and yet 
there was some scent or savour in it which they could not describe: it was 
faint, but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar 
by a cool breeze at night. The effect of the draught began at the toes, and 
rose steadily through every limb, bringing refreshment and vigour as it 
coursed upwards, right to the tips of the hair. Indeed the hobbits felt that 
the hair on their heads was actually standing up, waving and curling and 
growing. As for Treebeard, he first laved his feet in the basin beyond the 
arch, and then he drained his bowl at one draught, one long, slow draught. 
The hobbits thought he would never stop. 

At last he set the bowl down again. 'Ah — ah,' he sighed. 'Hm, hoom, 
now we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and I will lie down; that 
will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep.' 

On the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs; not 
more than a couple of feet high, covered deep in dried grass and bracken. 
Treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of 
bending at his middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind 
his head, looking up at the ceiling, upon which lights were flickering, like 
the play of leaves in the sunshine. Merry and Pippin sat beside him on 
pillows of grass. 

'Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!' said Treebeard. 

The hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since 
they left Hobbiton. They followed no very clear order, for they interrupted 
one another continually, and Treebeard often stopped the speaker, and went 
back to some earlier point, or jumped forward asking questions about later 
events. They said nothing whatever about the Ring, and did not tell him why 
they set out or where they were going to; and he did not ask for any 
reasons. 

He was immensely interested in everything: in the Black Riders, in 
Elrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of 
Moria, and in Lothlurien and Galadriel. He made them describe the Shire and 
its country over and over again. He said an odd thing at this point. 'You 
never see any, hm, any Ents round there do you?' he asked. 'Well, not Ents, 
Entwives I should really say.' 

EntwivesT said Pippin. 'Are they like you at all?' 

Yes, hm, well no: I do not really know now, said Treebeard 




thoughtfully. 'But they would like your country, so I just wondered.' 

Treebeard was however especially interested in everything that 
concerned Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman's doings. The 
hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a 
rather vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told the Council. But they 
were clear at any rate that UgKDk and his troop came from Isengard, and 
spoke of Saruman as their master. 

'Hm, hoom!' said Treebeard, when at last their story had wound and 
wandered down to the battle of the Ores and the Riders of Rohan. 'Well, 
well! That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me all, no 
indeed, not by a long way. But I do not doubt that you are doing as Gandalf 
would wish. There is something very big going on, that I can see, and what 
it is maybe I shall learn in good time, or in bad time. By root and twig, 
but it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the 
old lists, and behold the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and 
Gandalf takes them on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras 
Galadhon, and Ores pursue them down all the leagues of Wilderland: indeed 
they seem to be caught up in a great storm. I hope they weather it!' 

'And what about yourself?' asked Merry. 

'Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,' said Treebeard; 
'they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards 
are always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the 
future. I am not altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether 
on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for 
them, not even Elves nowadays. Still, I take more kindly to Elves than to 
others: it was the Elves that cured us of dumbness long ago, and that was a 
great gift that cannot be forgotten, though our ways have parted since. And 
there are some things, of course, whose side I am altogether not on; I am 
against them altogether: these — burbrum' (he again made a deep rumble of 
disgust)' — these Ores, and their masters. 

'I used to be anxious when the shadow lay on Mirkwood, but when it 
removed to Mordor, I did not trouble for a while: Mordor is a long way away. 
But it seems that the wind is setting East, and the withering of all woods 
may be drawing near. There is naught that an old Ent can do to hold back 
that storm: he must weather it or crack. 

'But Saruman now! Saruman is a neighbour: I cannot overlook him. I must 
do something. I suppose. I have often wondered lately what I should do about 




Saruman.' 

’Who is Saruman?' asked Pippin. 'Do you know anything about his 
history?' 'Saruman is a Wizard,' answered Treebeard. 'More than that I 
cannot say. I do not know the history of Wizards. They appeared first after 
the Great Ships came over the Sea; but if they came with the Ships I never 
can tell. Saruman was reckoned great among them. I believe. He gave up 
wandering about and minding the affairs of Men and Elves, some time ago — 
you would call it a very long time ago: and he settled down at Angrenost, or 
Isengard as the Men of Rohan call it. He was very quiet to begin with, but 
his fame began to grow. He was chosen to be head of the White Council, they 
say; but that did not turn out too well. I wonder now if even then Saruman 
was not turning to evil ways. But at any rate he used to give no trouble to 
his neighbours. I used to talk to him. There was a time when he was always 
walking about my woods. He was polite in those days, always asking my leave 
(at least when he met me); and always eager to listen. I told him many 
things that he would never have found out by himself; but he never repaid me 
in like kind. I cannot remember that he ever told, me anything. And he got 
more and more like that; his face, as I remember it-I have not seen it for 
many a day-became like windows in a stone wall: windows with shutters 
inside. 

'I think that I now understand what he is up to. He is plotting to 
become a Power. He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for 
growing things, except as far as they serve him for the moment. And now it 
is clear that he is a black traitor. He has taken up with foul folk, with 
the Ores. Brm, hoom! Worse than that: he has been doing something to them; 
something dangerous. For these Isengarders are more like wicked Men. It is a 
mark of evil things that came in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide 
the Sun; but Saruman's Ores can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder 
what he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of 
Ores and Men? That would be a black evil!' 

Treebeard rumbled for a moment, as if he were pronouncing some deep, 
subterranean Entish malediction. 'Some time ago I began to wonder how Ores 
dared to pass through my woods so freely,' he went on. 'Only lately did I 
guess that Saruman was to blame, and that long ago he had been spying out 
all the ways, and discovering my secrets. He and his foul folk are making 
havoc now. Down on the borders they are felling trees-good trees. Some of 
the trees they just cut down and leave to rot — ore-mischief that; but most 




are hewn up and carried off to feed the fires of Orthanc. There is always a 
smoke rising from Isengard these days. 

'Curse him, root and branch! Many of those trees were my friends 
creatures I had known from nut and acorn; many had voices of their own that 
are lost for ever now. And there are wastes of stump and bramble where once 
there were singing groves. I have been idle. I have let things slip. It must 
stop!' 

Treebeard raised himself from his bed with a jerk, stood up, and 
thumped his hand on the table. The vessels of light trembled and sent up two 
jets of flame. There was a flicker like green fire in his eyes, and his 
beard stood out stiff as a great besom. 

'I will stop it!' he boomed. 'And you shall come with me. You may be 
able to help me. You will be helping your own friends that way, too; for if 
Saruman is not checked Rohan and Gondor will have an enemy behind as well 
as 

in front. Our roads go together — to Isengard!' 

'We will come with you,' said Merry. 'We will do what we can.' 

'Yes!' said Pippin. 'I should like to see the White Hand overthrown. I 
should like to be there, even if I could not be of much use: I shall never 
forget Ugl®k and the crossing of Rohan.' 

'Good! Good!' said Treebeard. 'But I spoke hastily. We must not be 
hasty. I have become too hot. I must cool myself and think; fur it is easier 
to shout stop\ than to do it.' 

He strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain 
of the spring. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the drops of 
water fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green 
sparks. He came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent. 

After some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again. He seemed to be 
counting on his fingers. 'Fangorn, Finglas, Fladrif, aye, aye,' he sighed. 

'The trouble is that there are so few of us left,' he said turning towards 
the hobbits. 'Only three remain of the first Ents that walked in the woods 
before the Darkness: only myself, Fangorn, and Finglas and Fladrif — to 
give them their Elvish names; you may call them Leaflock and Skinbark if you 
like that better. And of us three Leaflock and Skinbark are not much use for 
this business. Leaflock has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he 
has taken to standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the 
deep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He 




used to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far 
even then. Skinbark lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is 
where the worst trouble has been. He was wounded by the Ores, and many of 
his folk and his tree-herds have been murdered and destroyed. He has gone up 
into the high places, among the birches that he loves best, and he will not 
come down. Still, I daresay I could get together a fair company of our 
younger folks-if I could make them understand the need: if I could rouse 
them: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity there are so few of us!' 

'Why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long?' 
asked Pippin. 'Have a great many died?' 

'Oh, no!' said Treebeard. 'None have died from inside, as you might 
say. Some have fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of course: and 
more have grown tree-ish. But there were never many of us and we have not 
increased. There have been no Entings — no children, you would say, not for 
a terrible long count of years. You see, we lost the Entwives.' 

'How very sad!' said Pippin. 'How was it that they all died?' 

'They did not dieV said Treebeard. 'I never said died. We lost them, I 
said. We lost them and we cannot find them.' He sighed. 'I thought most folk 
knew that. There were songs about the hunt of the Ents for the Entwives sung 
among Elves and Men from Mirkwood to Gondor. They cannot be quite 
forgotten.' 

'Well, I am afraid the songs have not come west over the Mountains to 
the Shire,' said Merry. 'Won't you tell us some more, or sing us one of the 
songs?' 

'Yes, I will indeed,' said Treebeard, seeming pleased with the request. 

'But I cannot tell it properly, only in short; and then we must end our 
talk: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey 
to begin.' 

'It is rather a strange and sad story,' he went on after a pause. 'When 
the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild, the Ents and the 
Entwives — and there were Entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness of 
Fimbrethil, of Wandlimb the lightfooted, in the days of our youth! — they 
walked together and they housed together. But our hearts did not go on 
growing in the same way: the Ents gave their love to things that they met in 
the world, and the Entwives gave their thought to other things, for the Ents 
loved the great trees; and the wild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; 
and they drank of the mountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees 




let fall in their path; and they learned of the Elves and spoke with the 
Trees. But the Entwives gave their minds to the lesser trees, and to the 
meads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests; and they saw the sloe 
in the thicket, and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in spring, and 
the green herbs in the waterlands in summer, and the seeding grasses in the 
autumn fields. They did not desire to speak with these things; but they 
wished them to hear and obey what was said to them. The Entwives ordered 
them to grow according to their wishes, and bear leaf and fruit to their 
liking; for the Entwives desired order, and plenty, and peace (by which they 
meant that things should remain where they had set them). So the Entwives 
made gardens to live in. But we Ents went on wandering, and we only came to 
the gardens now and again. Then when the Darkness came in the North, the 
Entwives crossed the Great River, and made new gardens, and tilled new 
fields, and we saw them more seldom. After the Darkness was overthrown the 
land of the Entwives blossomed richly, and their fields were full of corn. 

Many men learned the crafts of the Entwives and honoured them greatly; but 
we were only a legend to them, a secret in the heart of the forest. Yet here 
we still are, while all the gardens of the Entwives are wasted: Men call 
them the Brown Lands now. 

'I remember it was long ago — in the time of the war between Sauron 
and the Men of the Sea — desire came over me to see Fimbrethil again. Very 
fair she was still in my eyes, when I had last seen her, though little like 
the Entmaiden of old. For the Entwives were bent and browned by their 
labour; their hair parched by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their 
cheeks like redapples. Yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own 
people. We crossed over Anduin and came to their land: but we found a 
desert: it was all burned and uprooted, for war had passed over it. But the 
Entwives were not there. Long we called, and long we searched; and we asked 
all folk that we met which way the Entwives had gone. Some said they had 
never seen them; and some said that they had seen them walking away west, 
and some said east, and others south. But nowhere that we went could we find 
them. Our sorrow was very great. Yet the wild wood called, and we returned 
to it. For many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the 
Entwives. walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful names. 
But as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far. And now the 
Entwives are only a memory for us, and our beards are long and grey. The 
Elves made many songs concerning the Search of the Ents, and some of the 




songs passed into the tongues of Men. But we made no songs about it, being 
content to chant their beautiful names when we thought of the Entwives. We 
believe that we may meet again in a time to come, and perhaps we shall find 
somewhere a land where we can live together and both be content. But it is 
foreboded that that will only be when we have both lost all that we now 
have. And it may well be that that time is drawing near at last. For if 
Sauron of old destroyed the gardens, the Enemy today seems likely to wither 
all the woods. 

'There was an Elvish song that spoke of this, or at least so I 
understand it. It used to be sung up and down the Great River. It was never 
an Entish song, mark you: it would have been a very long song in Entish! But 
we know it by heart, and hum it now and again. This is how it runs in your 
tongue: 

ENT. 

When Spring unfolds the beechen leaf, and sap is in the bough; 

When light is on the wild-wood stream, and wind is on the brow; 

When stride is long, and breath is deep, and keen the mountain-air, 

Come back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is fair! 

entwife. 

When Spring is come to garth and field, and corn is in the blade; 

When blossom like a shining snow is on the orchard laid; 

When shower and Sun upon the Earth with fragrance fill the air, 

I'll linger here, and will not come, because my land is fair. 

ent. 

When Summer lies upon the world, and in a noon of gold 

Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold; 

When woodland halls are green and cool, and wind is in the West, 

Come back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is best! 

entwife. 

When Summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry brown; 

When straw is gold, and ear is white, and harvest comes to town; 

When honey spills, and apple swells, though wind be in the West, 

I'll linger here beneath the Sun, because my land is best! 




ent. 

When Winter comes, the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay; 

When trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day; 

When wind is in the deadly East, then in the bitter rain 

I'll look for thee, and call to thee; I'll come to thee again! 

entwife. 

When Winter comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last; 

When broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past; 

I'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again: 

Together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain! 

both. 

Together we will take the road that leads into the West, 

And far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest. ' 

Treebeard ended his song. 'That is how it goes,' he said. 'It is 
Elvish, of course: lighthearted, quickworded, and soon over. I daresay it is 
fair enough. But the Ents could say more on their side, if they had time ! 

But now I am going to stand up and take a little sleep. Where will you 
stand?' 

'We usually lie down to sleep,' said Merry. 'We shall be all right 
where we are.' 

'Lie down to sleep!' said Treebeard. 'Why of course you do! Hm, hoom: I 
was forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times; almost 
thought that I was talking to young Entings, I did. Well, you can lie on the 
bed. I am going to stand in the rain. Good night!' 

Merry and Pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass 
and fern. It was fresh, and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights died down, 
and the glow of the trees faded; but outside under the arch they could see 
old Treebeard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head. The 
bright stars peered out of the sky, and lit the falling water as it spilled 
on to his fingers and head, and dripped, dripped, in hundreds of silver 
drops on to his feet. Listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits 
fell asleep. 

They woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court, and on to 
the floor of the bay. Shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff 




easterly wind. Treebeard was not to be seen; but while Merry and Pippin were 
bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and singing, as he 
came up the path between the trees. 

'Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!' he boomed, when he saw 
them. 

'You sleep long. I have been many a hundred strides already today. Now we 
will have a drink, and go to Entmoot.' 

He poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar; but from a 
different jar. The taste was not the same as it had been the night before: 
it was earthier and richer, more sustaining and food-like, so to speak. 

While the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of the bed, and nibbling small 
pieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a necessary part 
of breakfast than because they felt hungry), Treebeard stood, humming in 
Entish or Elvish or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky. 

'Where is Entmoot?' Pippin ventured to ask. 

'Hoo, eh? Entmoot?' said Treebeard, turning round. 'It is not a place, 
it is a gathering of Ents — which does not often happen nowadays. But I 
have managed to make a fair number promise to come. We shall meet in the 
place where we have always met: Derndingle Men call it. It is away south 
from here. We must be there before noon.' 

Before long they set off. Treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as 
on the previous day. At the entrance to the court he turned to the right, 
stepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along the feet of great 
tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets 
of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. Soon 
Treebeard 

turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the 
trees were larger, taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever 
seen before. For a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they 
had noticed when they first ventured into Fangorn, but it soon passed. 
Treebeard did not talk to them. He hummed to himself deeply and 
thoughtfully, but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like 
boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar 
boom, and 

so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought 
they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of 
the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of 




the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side. 

They had been going for a long while — Pippin had tried to keep count 
of the ’ent-strides' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand — 
when Treebeard began to slacken his pace. Suddenly he stopped, put the 
hobbits down, and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a 
hollow tube; then he blew or called through them. A great hoom, hom rang out 
like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. 

Far off there came from several directions a similar hoom, hom, hoom that 
was not an echo but an answer. 

Treebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and strode on 
again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the 
answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked 
like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the 
hobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and 
were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore 
many stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds. 

Turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came in a 
few strides to a narrow entrance. Through it a worn path passed and dived 
suddenly down a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending 
into a great dingle, almost as round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned 
at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge. It was smooth and grassclad 
inside, and there were no trees except three very tall and beautiful 
silver -birches that stood at the bottom of the bowl. Two other paths led 
down into the dingle: from the west and from the east. 

Several Ents had already arrived. More were coming in down the other 
paths, and some were now following Treebeard. As they drew near the hobbits 
gazed at them. They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like 
Treebeard as one hobbit is like another (at any rate to a stranger's eye); 
and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind. The Ents were 
as different from one another as trees from trees: some as different as one 
tree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and 
history; and some as different as one tree-kind from another, as birch from 
beech; oak from fir. There were a few older Ents, bearded and gnarled like 
hale but ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as Treebeard); and 
there were tall strong Ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like 
forest-trees in their prime; but there were no young Ents, no saplings. 
Altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of 




the dingle, and as many more were marching in. 

At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they 
saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and 
length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from 
three to nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded 
them of beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds. Some recalled the 
chestnut: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick 
legs. Some recalled the ash: tall straight grey Ents with many-fingered 
hands and long legs; some the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, 
the rowan, and the linden. But when the Ents all gathered round Treebeard, 
bowing their heads slightly, murmuring in their slow musical voices, and 
looking long and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw that they 
were all of the same kindred, and all had the same eyes: not all so old or 
so deep as Treebeard's, but all with the same slow, steady, thoughtful 
expression, and the same green flicker. 

As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle 
round Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began. The Ents 
began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were 
all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one 
side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the 
other side. Though he could not catch or understand any of the words — he 
supposed the language was Entish — Pippin found the sound very pleasant to 
listen to at first; but gradually his attention wavered. After a long time 
(and the chant showed no signs of slackening) he found himself wondering, 
since Entish was such an ’unhasty' language, whether they had yet got 
further than Good Morning ; and if Treebeard was to call the roll, how many 
days it would take to sing all their names. 'I wonder what the Entish is for 
yes or no,' he thought. He yawned. 

Treebeard was immediately aware of him. 'Hm, ha, hey, my Pippin!' he 
said, and the other Ents all stopped their chant. 'You are a hasty folk, I 
was forgetting; and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not 
understand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the Entmoot, 
and 

they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not Ores, and that a 
new line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that 
is quick work for an Entmoot. You and Merry can stroll about in the dingle, 
if you like. There is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away 




yonder in the north bank. There are still some words to speak before the 
Moot really begins. I will come and see you again, and tell you how things 
are going.' 

He put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed low. This 
feat seemed to amuse the Ents very much, to judge by the tone of their 
murmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their 
own business. Merry and Pippin climbed up the path that came in from the 
west, and looked through the opening in the great hedge. Long tree-clad 
slopes rose from the lip of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the 
fir-trees of the furthest ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a 
high mountain. Southwards to their left they could see the forest falling 
away down into the grey distance. There far away there was a pale green 
glimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan. 

'I wonder where Isengard is?' said Pippin. 

'I don’t know quite where we are,' said Merry; 'but that peak is 
probably Methedras. and as far as I can remember the ring of Isengard lies 
in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains. It is probably down 
behind this great ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left 
of the peak, don't you think?' 

'What is Isengard like?' said Pippin. 'I wonder what Ents can do about 
it anyway.' 'So do I,' said Merry. 'Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or 
hills, I think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in 
the middle, called Orthanc. Saruman has a tower on it. There is a gate, 
perhaps more than one, in the encircling wall, and I believe there is a 
stream running through it; it comes out of the mountains, and flows on 
across the Gap of Rohan. It does not seem the sort of place for Ents to 
tackle. But I have an odd feeling about these Ents: somehow I don't think 
they are quite as safe and, well funny as they seem. They seem slow, queer, 
and patient, almost sad; and yet I believe they could be roused. If that 
happened, I would rather not be on the other side.' 

'Yes!' said Pippin. 'I know what you mean. There might be all the 
difference between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing, and a bull 
charging; and the change might come suddenly. I wonder if Treebeard will 
rouse them. I am sure he means to try. But they don't like being roused. 
Treebeard got roused himself last night, and then bottled it up again.' 

The hobbits turned back. The voices of the Ents were still rising and 
falling in their conclave. The sun had now risen high enough to look over 




the high hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward 
side of the dingle with a cool yellow light. There they saw a little 
glittering fountain. They walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet 
of the evergreens-it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again, 
and not to be in a hurry-and then they climbed down to the gushing water. 
They drank a little, a clean, cold, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy 
stone, watching the patches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the 
sailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents 
went on. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and 
far from everything that had ever happened to them. A great longing came 
over them for the faces and voices of their companions, especially for Frodo 
and Sam, and for Strider. 

At last there came a pause in the Ent -voices; and looking up they saw 
Treebeard coming towards them, with another Ent at his side. 

'Hm, hoom, here I am again,' said Treebeard. 'Are you getting weary, or 
feeling impatient, hmm, eh? Well, I am afraid that you must not get 
impatient yet. We have finished the first stage now; but I have still got to 
explain things again to those that live a long way off, far from Isengard, 
and those that I could not get round to before the Moot, and after that we 
shall have to decide what to do. However, deciding what to do does not take 
Ents so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make 
up their minds about. Still, it is no use denying, we shall be here a long 
time yet: a couple of days very likely. So I have brought you a companion. 

He has an ent-house nearby. Bregalad is his Elvish name. He says he has 
already made up his mind and does not need to remain at the Moot. Hm, hm, he 
is the nearest thing among us to a hasty Ent. You ought to get on together. 
Good-bye!' Treebeard turned and left them. 

Bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly; and they 
looked at him, wondering when he would show any signs of 'hastiness'. He was 
tall, and seemed to be one of the younger Ents; he had smooth shining skin 
on his arms and legs; his lips were ruddy, and his hair was grey-green. He 
could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind. At last he spoke, and 
his voice though resonant was higher and clearer than Treebeard's. 

'Ha, hmm, my friends, let us go for a walk!' he said. 'I am Bregalad, 
that is Quickbeam in your language. But it is only a nickname, of course. 

They have called me that ever since I said yes to an elder Ent before he had 
finished his question. Also I drink quickly, and go out while some are still 




wetting their beards. Come with me!' 

He reached down two shapely arms and gave a long -fingered hand to each 
of the hobbits. All that day they walked about in the woods with him, 
singing, and laughing; for Quickbeam often laughed. He laughed if the sun 
came out from behind a cloud, he laughed if they came upon a stream or 
spring: then he stooped and splashed his feet and head with water; he 
laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees. Whenever he saw a 
rowan-tree he halted a while with his arms stretched out, and sang, and 
swayed as he sang. 

At nightfall he brought them to his ent -house: nothing more than a 
mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank. Rowan-trees grew in a circle 
about it, and there was water (as in all ent -houses), a spring bubbling out 
from the bank. They talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest. Not 
far away the voices of the Entmoot could be heard still going on; but now 
they seemed deeper and less leisurely, and every now and again one great 
voice would rise in a high and quickening music, while all the others died 
away. But beside them Bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue, almost 
whispering; and they learned that he belonged to Skinbark's people, and the 
country where they had lived had been ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits 
quite enough to explain his ’hastiness', at least in the matter of Ores. 

'There were rowan-trees in my home,' said Bregalad, softly and sadly, 
'rowan-trees that took root when I was an Enting, many many years ago in the 
quiet of the world. The oldest were planted by the Ents to try and please 
the Entwives; but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew 
where whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing. Yet there are no trees 
of all that race, the people of the Rose, that are so beautiful to me. And 
these trees grew and grew, till the shadow of each was like a green hall, 
and their red berries in the autumn were a burden, and a beauty and a 
wonder. Birds used to flock there. I like birds, even when they chatter; and 
the rowan has enough and to spare. But the birds became unfriendly and 
greedy and tore at the trees, and threw the fruit down and did not eat it. 

Then Ores came with axes and cut down my trees. I came and called them by 
their long names, but they did not quiver, they did not hear or answer: they 
lay dead. 

O Orofarnl, Lassemista, Carnimnril! 

O rowan fair, upon your hair how white the blossom lay ! 

O rowan mine, I saw you shine upon a summer's day, 




Your rind so bright, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft: 

Upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft! 

O rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey; 

Your crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day. 

O Orofarnl, Lassemista, Carnimnril! 

The hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of Bregalad, 
that seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved. 

The next day they spent also in his company, but they did not go far 
from his 'house'. Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the 
bank; for the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer; there was 
little sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the Ents at the Moot 
still rose and fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes low and sad, 
sometimes quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge. A second night 
came and still the Ents held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful 
stars. 

The third day broke, bleak and windy. At sunrise the Ents' voices rose 
to a great clamour and then died down again. As the morning wore on the wind 
fell and the air grew heavy with expectancy. The hobbits could see that 
Bregalad was now listening intently, although to them, down in the dell of 
his ent -house, the sound of the Moot was faint. 

The afternoon came, and the sun, going west towards the mountains, sent 
out long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds. 
Suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet; the whole forest 
stood in listening silence. Of course, the Ent- voices had stopped. What did 
that mean? Bregalad was standing up erect and tense, looking back northwards 
towards Derndingle. 

Then with a crash came a great ringing shout: ra-hoom-rah! The trees 
quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them. There was another pause, and 
then a marching music began like solemn drums, and above the rolling beats 
and booms there welled voices singing high and strong. 

We come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom! 

The Ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song: 

We come, we come with horn and drum: ta-ryna ryna ryna rom! 

Bregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house. 

Before long they saw the marching line approaching: the Ents were 
swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them. Treebeard was 
at their head, and some fifty followers were behind him, two abreast, 




keeping step with their feet and beating time with their hands upon their 
flanks. As they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen. 

'Hoom, hom! Here we come with a boom, here we come at last!' called 
Treebeard when he caught sight of Bregalad and the hobbits. ’Come, join the 
Moot! We are off. We are off to Isengard!' 

To Isengard!' the Ents cried in many voices. 

'To Isengard!' 

To Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone; 

Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone, 

We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door; 

For bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars — we go to war! 

To land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we 
come; 

To Isengard with doom we come! 

With doom we come, with doom we come! 

So they sang as they marched southwards. 

Bregalad, his eyes shining, swung into the line beside Treebeard. The 
old Ent now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and 
so they rode proudly at the head of the sin ng company with beating hearts 
and heads held high. Though they ad expected something to happen eventually, 
they were amazed at the change that had come over the Ents. It seemed now as 
sudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike. 

'The Ents made up their minds rather quickly, after all, didn't they?' 

Pippin ventured to say after some time, when for a moment the singing 
paused, and only the beating of hands and feet was heard. 

'Quickly?' said Treebeard. 'Hoom! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I expected. 
Indeed I have not seen them roused like this for many an age. We Ents do not 
like being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our 
trees and our lives are in great danger. That has not happened in this 
Forest since the wars of Sauron and the Men of the Sea. It is the ore-work, 
the wanton hewing — rbrum — without even the bad excuse of feeding the 
fires, that has so angered us; and the treachery of a neighbour, who should 
have helped us. Wizards ought to know better: they do know better. There is 
no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such 
treachery. Down with Saruman!' 

'Will you really break the doors of Isengard?' asked Merry. 

'Ho, hm, well, we could, you know! You do not know, perhaps, how strong 




we are. Maybe you have heard of Trolls? They are mighty strong. But Trolls 
are only counterfeits, made by the Enemy in the Great Darkness, in mockery 
of Ents, as Ores were of Elves. We are stronger than Trolls. We are made of 
the bones of the earth. We can split stone like the roots of trees, only 
quicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused! If we are not hewn down, or 
destroyed by fire or blast of sorcery, we could split Isengard into 
splinters and crack its walls into rubble.' 

'But Saruman will try to stop you. won't he?' 

'Hm, ah, yes, that is so. I have not forgotten it. Indeed I have 
thought long about it. But. you see, many of the Ents are younger than I am. 
by many lives of trees. They are all roused now. and their mind is all on 
one thing: breaking Isengard. But they will start thinking again before 
long; they will cool down a little, when we take our evening drink. What a 
thirst we shall have! But let them march now and sing! We have a long way to 
go, and there is time ahead for thought. It is something to have started.' 

Treebeard marched on, singing with the others for a while. But after a 
time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. Pippin could see that 
his old brow was wrinkled and knotted. At last he looked up, and Pippin 
could see a sad look in his eyes, sad but not unhappy. There was a light in 
them, as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his 
thought. 

'Of course, it is likely enough, my friends,' he said slowly, 'likely 
enough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we 
stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. 
That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are 
marching now. It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the 
Ents may be worth a song. Aye,' he sighed, 'we may help the other peoples 
before we pass away. Still, I should have liked to see the songs come true 
about the Entwives. I should dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil again. But 
there, my friends, songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and 
their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.' 

The Ents went striding on at a great pace. They had descended into a 
long fold of the land that fell away southward; now they began to climb up, 
and up, on to the high western ridge. The woods fell away and they came to 
scattered groups of birch, and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt 
pine-trees grew. The sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front. Grey dusk 
fell. 




Pippin looked behind. The number of the Ents had grown — or what was 
happening? Where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he 
thought he saw groves of trees. But they were moving! Could it be that the 
trees of Fangorn were awake, and the forest was rising, marching over the 
hills to war? He rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived 
him; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. There was a noise like 
wind in many branches. The Ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge 
now, and all song had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing was 
to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the Ents, 
and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves. At last 
they stood upon the summit, and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft 
at the end of the mountains: Nan Curunnr, the Valley of Saruman. 

'Night lies over Isengard,' said Treebeard. 




Chapter 5 . The White Rider 



'My very bones are chilled,' said Gimli, flapping his arms and stamping 
his feet. Day had come at last. At dawn the companions had made such 
breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to 
search the ground again for signs of the hobbits. 

'And do not forget that old man!' said Gimli. 'I should be happier if I 
could see the print of a boot.' 

'Why would that make you happy?' said Legolas. 

'Because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he 
seemed,' answered the Dwarf. 

'Maybe,' said the Elf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the 
grass is deep and springy.' 

'That would not baffle a Ranger,' said Gimli. 'A bent blade is enough 
for Aragorn to read. But I do not expect him to find any traces. It was an 
evil phantom of Saruman that we saw last night. I am sure of it, even under 
the light of morning. His eyes are looking out on us from Fangorn even now, 
maybe.' 

'It is likely enough,' said Aragorn; 'yet I am not sure. I am thinking 
of the horses. You said last night, Gimli, that they were scared away. But I 
did not think so. Did you hear them, Legolas? Did they sound to you like 
beasts in terror?' 

'No,' said Legolas. 'I heard them clearly. But for the darkness and our 
own fear I should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden 
gladness. They spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have 
long missed.' 

'So I thought,' said Aragorn; 'but I cannot read the riddle, unless 
they return. Come! The light is growing fast. Let us look first and guess 
later! We should begin here, near to our own camping-ground, searching 
carefully all about, and working up the slope towards the forest. To find 
the hobbits is our errand, whatever we may think of our visitor in the 
night. If they escaped by some chance, then they must have hidden in the 
trees, or they would have been seen. If we find nothing between here and the 
eaves of the wood, then we will make a last search upon the battle-field and 
among the ashes. But there is little hope there: the horsemen of Rohan did 




their work too well.' 

For some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground. The 
tree stood mournfully above them, its dry leaves now hanging limp, and 
rattling in the chill easterly wind. Aragorn moved slowly away. He came to 
the ashes of the watch-fire near the river -bank, and then began to retrace 
the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought. Suddenly 
he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. Then he called to 
the others. They came running up. 

'Here at last we find news!' said Aragorn. He lifted up a broken leaf 
for them to see, a large pale leaf of golden hue, now fading and turning 
brown. 'Here is a mallorn-leaf of Lurien, and there are small crumbs on it, 
and a few more crumbs in the grass. And see! there are some pieces of cut 
cord lying nearby!' 

'And here is the knife that cut them!' said Gimli. He stooped and drew 
out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged 
blade. The haft from which it had been snapped was beside it. 'It was an 
ore-weapon,' he said, holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the 
carved handle: it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes 
and leering mouth. 

'Well, here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found!' exclaimed 
Legolas. 'A bound prisoner escapes both from the Ores and from the 
surrounding horsemen. He then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his 
bonds with an ore-knife. But how and why? For if his legs were tied, how did 
he walk? And if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? And if neither 
were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? Being pleased with his skill, he 
then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! That at least is enough to show 
that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that, I suppose, he 
turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. It should 
be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!' 

'There was sorcery here right enough,' said Gimli. 'What was that old 
man doing? What have you to say, Aragorn, to the reading of Legolas. Can you 
better it?' 

'Maybe, I could,' said Aragorn, smiling. 'There are some other signs 
near at hand that you have not considered. I agree that the prisoner was a 
hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free, before he came here. I 
guess that it was hands, because the riddle then becomes easier, and also 
because, as I read the marks, he was carried to this point by an Ore. Blood 




was spilled there, a few paces away, ore-blood. There are deep prints of 
hoofs all about this spot, and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away. 

The Ore was slain by horsemen, and later his body was hauled to the fire. 

But the hobbit was not seen: he was not "in the open", for it was night and 
he still had his elven-cloak. He was exhausted and hungry, and it is not to 
be wondered at that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen 
enemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. But it is a comfort 
to know that he had some lembas in his pocket, even though he ran away 
without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. I say he, though I 
hope and guess that both Merry and Pippin were here together. There is, 
however, nothing to show that for certain.' 

'And how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand 
free?' asked Gimli. 

'I do not know how it happened,' answered Aragorn. 'Nor do I know why 
an Ore was carrying them away. Not to help them to escape, we may be sure. 
Nay, rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled 
me from the beginning: why when Boromir had fallen were the Ores content 
with the capture of Merry and Pippin? They did not seek out the rest of us, 
nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards Isengard. 

Did they suppose they had captured the Ring -bearer and his faithful comrade? 

I think not. Their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to Ores, 
even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of 
the Ring: they are not trusty servants. But I think the Ores had been 
commanded to capture hobbits, alive, at all costs. An attempt was made to 
slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle. Treachery perhaps, 
likely enough with such folk; some large and bold Ore may have been trying 
to escape with the prize alone, for his own ends. There, that is my tale. 

Others might be devised. But on this we may count in any case: one at least 
of our friends escaped. It is our task to find him and help him before we 
return to Rohan. We must not be daunted by Fangorn, since need drove him 
into that dark place.' 

'I do not know which daunts me more: Fangorn, or the thought of the 
long road through Rohan on foot,' said Gimli. 

'Then let us go to the forest,' said Aragorn. 

It was not long before Aragorn found fresh signs. At one point, near 
the bank of the Entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints, but too 
light for much to be made of them. Then again beneath the bole of a great 




tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. The earth was 
bare and dry, and did not reveal much. 

'One hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then 
he turned away into the forest,' said Aragorn. 

'Then we must go in, too,' said Gimli. 'But I do not like the look of 
this Fangorn: and we were warned against it. I wish the chase had led 
anywhere else!' 

'I do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say,' said 
Legolas. He stood under the eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he 
were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. 'No, it is not 
evil; or what evil is in it is far away. I catch only the faintest echoes of 
dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. There is no malice near 
us; but there is watchfulness, and anger.' 

'Well, it has no cause to be angry with me,' said Gimli. 'I have done 
it no harm. ' 

'That is just as well,' said Legolas. 'But nonetheless it has suffered 
harm. There is something happening inside, or going to happen. Do you not 
feel the tenseness? It takes my breath.' 

'I feel the air is stuffy,' said the Dwarf. 'This wood is lighter than 
Mirkwood, but it is musty and shabby.' 

'It is old, very old,' said the Elf. 'So old that almost I feel young 
again, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you children. It is old and 
full of memory. I could have been happy here, if I had come in days of 
peace.' 

'I dare say you could,' snorted Gimli. 'You are a Wood-elf, anyway, 
though Elves of any kind are strange folk. Yet you comfort me. Where you go, 
I will go. But keep your bow ready to hand, and I will keep my axe loose in 
my belt. Not for use on trees,' he added hastily, looking up at the tree 
under which they stood. 'I do not wish to meet that old man at unawares 
without an argument ready to hand, that is all. Let us go!' 

With that the three hunters plunged into the forest of Fangorn. Legolas 
and Gimli left the tracking to Aragorn. There was little for him to see. The 
floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing 
that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks 
of the stream. So it was that he came upon the place where Merry and Pippin 
had drunk and bathed their feet. There plain for all to see were the 
footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other. 




This is good tidings,' said Aragorn. 'Yet the marks are two days old 
And it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water -side.’ 

Then what shall we do now?’ said Gimli. 'We cannot pursue them through 
the whole fastness of Fangorn. We have come ill supplied. If we do not find 
them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and 
show our friendship by starving together.' 

'If that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,' said Aragorn. 

'Let us go on.' 

They came at length to the steep abrupt end of Treebeard's Hill and 
looked up at the rock -wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf. 
Gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now 
looked less grey and drear. 

'Let us go up and look about us!' said Legolas. 'I will feel my breath 
short. I should like to taste a freer air for a while.' 

The companions climbed up. Aragorn came last, moving slowly: he was 
scanning the steps and ledges closely. 

'I am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here,' he said. 'But 
there are other marks, very strange marks, which I do not understand. I 
wonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess 
which way they went next?' 

He stood up and looked about, but he saw nothing that was of any use. 
The shelf faced southward and eastward; but only on the east was the view 
open. There he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards 
the plain from which they had come. 

'We have journeyed a long way round,' said Legolas. 'We could have all 
come here safe together, if we had left the Great River on the second or 
third day and struck west. Few can foresee whither their road will lead 
them, till they come to its end.' 

'But we did not wish to come to Fangorn,' said Gimli. 

'Yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,' said Legolas. 'Look!' 

'Look at what?' said Gimli. 

'There in the trees.' 

'Where? I have not elf-eyes.' 

'Hush! Speak more softly! Look!' said Legolas pointing. 'Down in the 
wood, back in the Way that we have just come. It is he. Cannot you see him, 
passing from tree to tree?' 

'I see, I see now!' hissed Gimli. 'Look, Aragorn! Did I not warn you? 




There is the old man. All in dirty grey rags: that is why I could not see 
him at first.' 

Aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly. It was not far 
away. It looked like an old beggar-man, walking wearily, leaning on a rough 
staff. His head was bowed, and he did not look towards them. In other lands 
they would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each 
feeling a strange expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden 
power-or menace. 

Gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure drew 
nearer. Then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he burst out: 'Your 
bow, Legolas! Bend it! Get ready! It is Saruman. Do not let him speak, or 
put a spell upon us! Shoot first!' 

Legolas took his bow and bent it, slowly and as if some other will 
resisted him. He held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the 
string. Aragorn stood silent, his face was watchful and intent. 

'Why are you waiting? What is the matter with you?' said Gimli in a 
hissing whisper. 

'Legolas is right,' said Aragorn quietly. 'We may not shoot an old man 
so, at unawares and unchallenged, whatever fear or doubt be on us. Watch and 
wait!' 

At that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising 
speed to the foot of the rock-wall. Then suddenly he looked up, while they 
stood motionless looking down. There was no sound. 

They could not see his face: he was hooded, and above the hood he wore 
a wide-brimmed hat, so that all his features were over-shadowed, except for 
the end of his nose and his grey beard. Yet it seemed to Aragorn that he 
caught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the 
hooded brows. 

At last the old man broke the silence. 'Well met indeed, my friends,' 
he said in a soft voice. 'I wish to speak to you. Will you come down or 
shall I come up?' Without waiting for an answer he began to climb. 

'Now!' said Gimli. 'Stop him, Legolas!' 

'Did I not say that I wished to speak to you?' said the old man. 'Put 
away that bow, Master Elf!' 

The bow and arrow fell from Legolas' hands, and his arms hung loose at 
his sides. 

'And you, Master Dwarf, pray take your hand from your axe-haft, till I 




am up! You will not need such arguments.' 

Gimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old man 
sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat. All weariness seemed to have 
left him. As he stepped up on to the shelf there was a gleam, too brief for 
certainty, a quick glint of white, as if some garment shrouded by the grey 
rags had been for an instant revealed The intake of Gimli's breath could be 
heard as a loud hiss in the silence. 

'Well met, I say again!' said the old man, coming towards them. When he 
was a few feet away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with his head thrust 
forward, peering at them from under his hood. 'And what may you be doing in 
these parts? An Elf, a Man, and a Dwarf, all clad in elvish fashion. No 
doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all. Such things are not often 
seen here.' 

'You speak as one that knows Fangorn well,' said Aragorn. 'Is that so?' 

'Not well,' said the old man: 'that would be the study of many lives. 

But I come here now and again.' 

'Might we know your name, and then hear what it is that you have to say 
to us?' said Aragorn. 'The morning passes, and we have an errand that will 
not wait.' 

'As for what I wished to say, I have said it: What may you be doing, 
and what tale can you tell of yourselves? As for my name!' He broke off, 
laughing long and softly. Aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the 
sound, a strange cold thrill; and yet it was not fear or terror that he 
felt: rather it was like the sudden bite of a keen air, or the slap of a 
cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper. 

'My name!' said the old man again. 'Have you not guessed it already? 

You have heard it before, I think. Yes, you have heard it before. But come 
now, what of your tale?' 

The three companions stood silent and made no answer. 

'There are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to 
tell,' said the old man. 'Happily I know something of it. You are tracking 
the footsteps of two young hobbits, I believe. Yes, hobbits. Don't stare, as 
if you had never heard the strange name before. You have, and so have I. 
Well, they climbed up here the day before yesterday; and they met someone 
that they did not expect. Does that comfort you? And now you would like to 
know where they were taken? Well, well, maybe I can give you some news 
about 




that. But why are we standing? Your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent 
as you thought. Let us sit down and be more at ease.' 

The old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and 
rock at the foot of the cliff behind. Immediately, as if a spell had been 
removed, the others relaxed and stirred. Gimli's hand went at once to his 
axe-haft. Aragorn drew his sword. Legolas picked up his bow. 

The old man took no notice, but stooped and sat himself on a low flat 
stone. Then his grey cloak drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he 
was clothed beneath all in white. 

'Saruman!' cried Gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand, 'speak! 
Tell us where you have hidden our friends ! What have you done with them? 
Speak, or I will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it 
hard to deal with!' 

The old man was too quick for him. He sprang to his feet and leaped to 
the top of a large rock. There he stood, grown suddenly tall, towering above 
them. His hood and his grey rags were flung away. His white garments shone. 
He lifted up his staff, and Gimli's axe leaped from his grasp and fell 
ringing on the ground. The sword of Aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, 
blazed with a sudden fire. Legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high 
into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame. 

'Mithrandir!' he cried. 'Mithrandir!' 

'Well met, I say to you again. Legolas!' said the old man. 

They all gazed at him. His hair was white as snow in the sunshine; and 
gleaming white was his robe; the eyes under his deep brows were bright, 
piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. Between wonder, joy, 
and fear they stood and found no words to say. 

At last Aragorn stirred. 'Gandalf!' he said. 'Beyond all hope you 
return to us in our need! What veil was over my sight? Gandalf!' Gimli said 
nothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes. 

'Gandalf,' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long 
disused word. 'Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.' 

He stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it 
about him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but now was hid in 
cloud again. 'Yes, you may still call me Gandalf,' he said, and the voice 
was the voice of their old friend and guide. 'Get up, my good Gimli! No 
blame to you, and no harm done to me. Indeed my friends, none of you have 
any weapon that could hurt me. Be merry! We meet again. At the turn of the 




tide. The great storm is coming, but the tide has turned.' 

He laid his hand on Gimli’s head, and the Dwarf looked up and laughed 
suddenly. 'Gandalf!' he said. 'But you are all in white!' 

'Yes, I am white now,' said Gandalf. 'Indeed I am Saruman, one might 
almost say, Saruman as he should have been. But come now, tell me of 
yourselves! I have passed through fire and deepwater, since we parted. I 
have forgotten much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had 
forgotten. I can see many things far off, but many things that are close at 
hand I cannot see. Tell me of yourselves!' 

'What do you wish to know?' said Aragorn. 'All that has happened since 
we parted on the bridge would be a long tale. Will you not first give us 
news of the hobbits? Did you find them, and are they safe?' 

'No, I did not find them,' said Gandalf. 'There was a darkness over the 
valleys of the Emyn Muil, and I did not know of their captivity, until the 
eagle told me.' 

'The eagle!' said Legolas. 'I have seen an eagle high and far off: the 
last time was three days ago, above the Emyn Muil.' 

'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'that was Gwaihir the Windlord, who rescued me 
from Orthanc. I sent him before me to watch the River and gather tidings. 

His sight is keen, but he cannot see all that passes under hill and tree. 

Some things he has seen, and others I have seen myself. The Ring now has 
passed beyond my help, or the help of any of the Company that set out from 
Rivendell. Very nearly it was revealed to the Enemy, but it escaped. I had 
some part in that: for I sat in a high place, and I strove with the Dark 
Tower; and the Shadow passed. Then I was weary, very weary; and I walked 
long in dark thought.' 

'Then you know about Frodo!' said Gimli. 'How do things go with him?' 

'I cannot say. He was saved from a great peril, but many lie before him 
still. He resolved to go alone to Mordor, and he set out: that is all that I 
can say.' 

'Not alone,' said Legolas. 'We think that Sam went with him.' 

'Did he!' said Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on 
his face. 'Did he indeed? It is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. 

Good! Very good! You lighten my heart. You must tell me more. Now sit by 
me 

and tell me the tale of your journey.' 

The companions sat on the ground at his feet, and Aragorn took up the 




tale. For a long while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions. His 
hands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were closed. At last when 
Aragorn spoke of the death of Boromir and of his last journey upon the Great 
River, the old man sighed. 

'You have not said all that you know or guess, Aragorn my friend,' he 
said quietly. 'Poor Boromir! I could not see what happened to him. It was a 
sore trial for such a man: a warrior, and a lord of men. Galadriel told me 
that he was in peril. But he escaped in the end. I am glad. It was not in 
vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for Boromir's sake. But 
that is not the only part they have to play. They were brought to Fangorn, 
and their coming was like the falling of small stones that starts an 
avalanche in the mountains. Even as we talk here, I hear the first 
rumblings. Saruman had best not be caught away from home when the dam 
bursts!' 

'In one thing you have not changed, dear friend,' said Aragorn: 'you 
still speak in riddles.' 

'What? In riddles?' said Gandalf. 'No! For I was talking aloud to 
myself. A habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak 
to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.' He laughed, but 
the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine. 

'I am no longer young even in the reckoning of Men of the Ancient 
Houses,' said Aragorn. 'Will you not open your mind more clearly to me?' 

'What then shall I say?' said Gandalf, and paused for a while in 
thought. 'This in brief is how I see things at the moment, if you wish to 
have a piece of my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of course, has long 
known that the Ring is abroad, and that it is borne by a hobbit. He knows 
now the number of our Company that set out from Rivendell, and the kind of 
each of us. But he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly. He supposes 
that we were all going to Minas Tirith; for that is what he would himself 
have done in our place. And according to his wisdom it would have been a 
heavy stroke against his power. Indeed he is in great fear, not knowing what 
mighty one may suddenly appear, wielding the Ring, and assailing him with 
war, seeking to cast him down and take his place. That we should wish to 
cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that occurs to 
his mind. That we should try to destroy the Ring itself has not yet entered 
into his darkest dream. In which no doubt you will see our good fortune and 
our hope. For imagining war he has let loose war, believing that he has no 




time to waste; for he that strikes the first blow, if he strikes it hard 
enough, may need to strike no more. So the forces that he has long been 
preparing he is now setting in motion, sooner than he intended. Wise fool. 

For if he had used all his power to guard Mordor, so that none could enter, 
and bent all his guild to the hunting of the Ring, then indeed hope would 
have faded: neither Ring nor Bearer could long have eluded him. But now his 
eye gazes abroad rather than near at home; and mostly he looks towards Minas 
Tirith. Very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm. 

’For already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay the 
Company have failed again. They have not found the Ring. Neither have they 
brought away any hobbits as hostages. Flad they done even so much as that, it 
would have been a heavy blow to us, and it might have been fatal. But let us 
not darken our hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the 
Dark Tower. For the Enemy has failed-so far. Thanks to Saruman:' 

'Then is not Saruman a traitor?' said Gimli. 

'Indeed yes,' said Gandalf. 'Doubly. And is not that strange? Nothing 
that we have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of 
Isengard. Even reckoned as a lord and captain Saruman has grown very strong. 
He threatens the Men of Rohan and draws off their help from Minas Tirith, 
even as the main blow is approaching from the East. Yet a treacherous weapon 
is ever a danger to the hand. Saruman also had a mind to capture the Ring, 
for himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes. So 
between them our enemies have contrived only to bring Merry and Pippin with 
marvellous speed, and in the nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they 
would never have come at all! 

'Also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their 
plans. No tidings of the battle will come to Mordor, thanks to the horsemen 
of Rohan; but the Dark Lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the Emyn 
Muil and borne away towards Isengard against the will of his own servants. 

He now has Isengard to fear as well as Minas Tirith. If Minas Tirith falls, 
it will go ill with Saruman.' 

'It is a pity that our friends lie in between,' said Gimli. 'If no land 
divided Isengard and Mordor, then they could fight while we watched and 
waited.' 

'The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,' 
said Gandalf. 'But Isengard cannot fight Mordor, unless Saruman first 
obtains the Ring. That he will never do now. He does not yet know his peril. 




There is much that he does not know. He was so eager to lay his hands on his 
prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on 
his messengers. But he came too late, for once, and the battle was over and 
beyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not remain here long. 

I look into his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes 
that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle; but he does 
not know whether the Ores were bringing any prisoners or not. And he does 
not know of the quarrel between his servants and the Ores of Mordor; nor 
does he know of the Winged Messenger.' 

'The Winged Messenger!' cried Legolas. 'I shot at him with the bow of 
Galadriel above Sarn Gebir, and I felled him from the sky. He filled us all 
with fear. What new terror is this?' 

'One that you cannot slay with arrows,' said Gandalf. 'You only slew 
his steed. It was a good deed; but the Rider was soon horsed again. For he 
was a Nazgyl, one of the Nine, who ride now upon winged steeds. Soon their 
terror will overshadow the last armies of our friends, cutting off the sun. 

But they have not yet been allowed to cross the River, and Saruman does not 
know of this new shape in which the Ringwraiths have been clad. His thought 
is ever on the Ring. Was it present in the battle? Was it found? What if 
Thjoden, Lord of the Mark, should come by it and learn of its power? That is 
the danger that he sees, and he has fled back to Isengard to double and 
treble his assault on Rohan. And all the time there is another danger, close 
at hand, which he does not see, busy with his fiery thoughts. He has 
forgotten Treebeard.' 

'Now you speak to yourself again,' said Aragorn with a smile. 
'Treebeard is not known to me. And I have guessed part of Saruman's double 
treachery; yet I do not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to Fangorn 
has served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.' 

'Wait a minute!' cried Gimli. 'There is another thing that I should 
like to know first. Was it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last night?' 

'You certainly did not see me,' answered Gandalf, 'therefore I must 
guess that you saw Saruman. Evidently we look so much alike that your desire 
to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.' 

'Good, good!' said Gimli. 'I am glad that it was not you.' 

Gandalf laughed again. 'Yes, my good Dwarf,' he said, 'it is a comfort 
not to be mistaken at all points. Do I not know it only too well! But, of 
course, I never blamed you for your welcome of me. How could I do so, who 




have so often counselled my friends to suspect even their own hands when 
dealing with the Enemy. Bless you, Gimli, son of Gluin! Maybe you will see 
us both together one day and judge between us!' 

'But the hobbits!' Legolas broke in. 'We have come far to seek them, 
and you seem to know where they are. Where are they now?' 

'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf. 

'The Ents!' exclaimed Aragorn. 'Then there is truth in the old legends 
about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees? 

Are there still Ents in the world? I thought they were only a memory of 
ancient days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of Rohan.' 

'A legend of Rohan!' cried Legolas. 'Nay, every Elf in Wilderland has 
sung songs of the old Onodrim and their long sorrow. Yet even among us they 
are only a memory. If I were to meet one still walking in this world, then 
indeed I should feel young again! But Treebeard: that is only a rendering of 
Fangorn into the Common Speech; yet you seem to speak of a person. Who is 
this Treebeard?' 

'Ah! now you are asking much,' said Gandalf. 'The little that I know of 
his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. 
Treebeard is Fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the 
Ents, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this 
Middle-earth. I hope indeed, Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and 
Pippin have been fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. For he 
came here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the 
roots of the mountains. He often comes here, especially when his mind is 
uneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him. I saw him four days 
ago striding among the trees, and I think he saw me, for he paused; but I 
did not speak, for I was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle 
with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.' 

'Perhaps he also thought that you were Saruman,' said Gimli. 'But you 
speak of him as if he was a friend. I thought Fangorn was dangerous.' 

'Dangerous!' cried Gandalf. 'And so am I, very dangerous: more 
dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive 
before the seat of the Dark Lord. And Aragorn is dangerous, and Legolas is 
dangerous. You are beset with dangers, Gimli son of Gluin; for you are 
dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. Certainly the forest of Fangorn is 
perilous-not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn 
himself, he is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. But now 




his long slow wrath is brimming over, and all the forest is filled with it. 

The coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: 
it will soon be running like a flood; but its tide is turned against Saruman 
and the axes of Isengard. A thing is about to happen which has not happened 
since the Elder Days: the Ents are going to wake up and find that they are 
strong.’ 

’What will they do?' asked Legolas in astonishment. 

'I do not know,' said Gandalf. 'I do not think they know themselves. I 
wonder.' He fell silent, his head bowed in thought. 

The others looked at him. A gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell 
on his hands, which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed to be filled 
with light as a cup is with water. At last he looked up and gazed straight 
at the sun. 

'The morning is wearing away,' he said. 'Soon we must go.' 

'Do we go to find our friends and to see Treebeard?' asked Aragorn. 

'No,' said Gandalf. 'That is not the road that you must take. I have 
spoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory. War is 

upon us and all our friends, a war in which only the use of the Ring 
could give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow and great 

fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am Gandalf, 

Gandalf the White, but Black is mightier still.' 

He rose and gazed out eastward, shading his eyes, as if he saw things 
far away that none of them could see. Then he shook his head. 'No,' he said 
in a soft voice, 'it has gone beyond our reach. Of that at least let us be 
glad. We can no longer be tempted to use the Ring. We must go down to face a 
peril near despair, yet that deadly peril is removed.' 

He turned. 'Come, Aragorn son of Arathorn!' he said. 'Do not regret 
your choice in the valley of the Emyn Muil, nor call it a vain pursuit. You 
chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice was just, and it 
has been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met 
too late. But the quest of your companions is over. Your next journey is 
marked by your given word. You must go to Edoras and seek out Thjoden in 
his 

hall. For you are needed. The light of And®ril must now be uncovered in the 
battle for which it has so long waited. There is war in Rohan, and worse 
evil: it goes ill with Thjoden.' 

'Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?' said Legolas. 




'I did not say so,' said Gandalf. ’Who knows? Have patience. Go where 
you must go, and hope! To Edoras! I go thither also.’ 

'It is a long way for a man to walk, young or old,' said Aragorn. 'I 
fear the battle will be over long ere I come there.’ 

'We shall see, we shall see,' said Gandalf. 'Will you come now with 
me?' 

'Yes, we will set out together,' said Aragorn. 'But I do not doubt that 
you will come there before me, if you wish.' He rose and looked long at 
Gandalf. The others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one 
another. The grey figure of the Man, Aragorn son of Arathorn, was tall, and 
stern as stone, his hand upon the hilt of his sword; he looked as if some 
king out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men. 
Before him stooped the old figure, white; shining now as if with some light 
kindled within, bent, laden with years, but holding a power beyond the 
strength of kings. 

'Do I not say truly, Gandalf,' said Aragorn at last, 'that you could go 
whithersoever you wished quicker than I? And this I also say: you are our 
captain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier 
than they: the White Rider. He has passed through the fire and the abyss, 
and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.' 

'Yes, together we will follow you,' said Legolas. 'But first, it would 
ease my heart, Gandalf, to hear what befell you in Moria. Will you not tell 
us? Can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered?' 

'I have stayed already too long,' answered Gandalf. 'Time is short. But 
if there were a year to spend, I would not tell you all.' 

'Then tell us what you will, and time allows!' said Gimli. 'Come, 
Gandalf, tell us how you fared with the Balrog!' 

'Name him not!' said Gandalf, and for a moment it seemed that a cloud 
of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death. 'Long 
time I fell,' he said at last, slowly, as if thinking back with difficulty. 

'Long I fell, and he fell with me. His fire was about me. I was burned. Then 
we plunged into the deep water and all was dark. Cold it was as the tide of 
death: almost it froze my heart.' 

'Deep is the abyss that is spanned by Durin's Bridge, and none has 
measured it,' said Gimli. 

'Yet it has a bottom, beyond light and knowledge,' said Gandalf. 
'Thither I came at last, to the uttermost foundations of stone. He was with 




me still. His fire was quenched, but now he was a thing of slime, stronger 
than a strangling snake. 

'We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. Ever 
he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark 
tunnels. They were not made by Durin's folk, Gimli son of Gluin. Far, far 
below the deepest delving of the Dwarves, the world is gnawed by nameless 
things. Even Sauron knows them not. They are older than he. Now I have 
walked there, but I will bring no report to darken the light of day. In that 
despair my enemy was my only hope, and I pursued him, clutching at his heel. 
Thus he brought me back at last to the secret ways of Khazad-dym: too well 
he knew them all. Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair.' 

'Long has that been lost,' said Gimli. 'Many have said that it was 
never made save in legend, but others say that it was destroyed.' 

'It was made, and it had not been destroyed,' said Gandalf. 'From the 
lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed, ascending in unbroken spiral 
in many thousand steps, until it issued at last in Durin's Tower carved in 
the living rock of Zirak-zigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine. 

'There upon Celebdil was a lonely window in the snow, and before it lay 
a narrow space, a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world. The sun shone 
fiercely there, but all below was wrapped in cloud. Out he sprang, and even 
as I came behind, he burst into new flame. There was none to see, or perhaps 
in after ages songs would still be sung of the Battle of the Peak.' Suddenly 
Gandalf laughed. 'But what would they say in song? Those that looked up from 
afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, 
and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into 
tongues of fire. Is not that enough? A great smoke rose about us, vapour and 
steam. Ice fell like rain. I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high 
place and broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin. Then 
darkness took me; and I strayed out of thought and time, and I wandered far 
on roads that I will not tell. 

'Naked I was sent back — for a brief time, until my task is done. And 
naked I lay upon the mountain-top. The tower behind was crumbled into dust, 
the window gone; the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone. I 
was alone, forgotten, without escape upon the hard horn of the world. There 
I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long 
as a life-age of the earth. Faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all 
lands: the springing and the dying, the song and the weeping, and the slow 




everlasting groan of overburdened stone. And so at the last Gwaihir the 
Windlord found me again, and he took me up and bore me away. 

’ ’Ever am I fated to be your burden, friend at need,' I said. 

1 'A burden you have been,' he answered, 'but not so now. Light as a 
swan's feather in my claw you are. The Sun shines through you. Indeed I do 
not think you need me any more: were I to let you fall you would float upon 
the wind.' 

' 'Do not let me fall!' I gasped, for I felt life in me again. 'Bear me 
to Lothlurien!' 

' 'That indeed is the command of the Lady Galadriel who sent me to look 
for you,' he answered. 

'Thus it was that I came to Caras Galadhon and found you but lately 
gone. I tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring 
healing not decay. Healing I found, and I was clothed in white. Counsel I 
gave and counsel took. Thence by strange roads I came, and messages I bring 
to some of you. To Aragorn I was bidden to say this: 

Where now are the D®nedain, Elessar, Elessar? 

Why do thy kinsfolk wander afar? 

Near is the hour when the Lost should come forth, 

And the Grey Company ride from the North. 

But dark is the path appointed for thee: 

The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea. 

To Legolas she sent this word: 

Legolas Greenleaf long under tree 

In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Seal 

If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, 

Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more. ' 

Gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes. 

'Then she sent me no message?' said Gimli and bent his head. 

'Dark are her words,' said Legolas, 'and little do they mean to those 
that receive them.' 

'That is no comfort,' said Gimli. 

'What then?' said Legolas. 'Would you have her speak openly to you of 
your death?' 

'Yes. if she had nought else to say.' 

'What is that?' said Gandalf, opening his eyes. 'Yes, I think I can 
guess what her words may mean. Your pardon, Gimli ! I was pondering the 




messages once again. But indeed she sent words to you, and neither dark nor 
sad. 

’ "To Gimli son of Gluin," she said, "give his Lady's greeting. 

Lock -bearer, wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee. But have a care 
to lay thine axe to the right tree ! " ’ 

’In happy hour you have returned to us, Gandalf,' cried the Dwarf, 
capering as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf-tongue. 'Come, come!’ he 
shouted, swinging his axe. ’Since Gandalf s head is now sacred, let us find 
one that it is right to cleave!’ 

’That will not be far to seek,’ said Gandalf, rising from his seat. 

'Come! We have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted 
friends. Now there is need of haste.' 

He wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak, and led the way. 
Following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way 
back through the forest, down the bank of the Entwash. They spoke no more 
words, until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of Fangorn. 
There was no sign of their horses to be seen. 

’They have not returned,’ said Legolas. 'It will be a weary walk!' 

'I shall not walk. Time presses,' said Gandalf. Then lifting up his 
head he gave a long whistle. So clear and piercing was the note that the 
others stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips. 
Three times he whistled; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that 
they heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern 
wind. They waited wondering. Before long there came the sound of hoofs, at 
first hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only to Aragorn as 
he lay upon the grass, then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick 
beat. 

'There is more than one horse coming,' said Aragorn. 

’Certainly,' said Gandalf. 'We are too great a burden for one.' 

'There are three,' said Legolas, gazing out over the plain. 'See how 
they run! There is Hasufel, and there is my friend Arod beside him! But 
there is another that strides ahead: a very great horse. I have not seen his 
like before.' 

'Nor will you again,' said Gandalf. 'That is Shadowfax. He is the chief 
of the Mearas, lords of horses, and not even Thjoden, King of Rohan, has 
ever looked on a better. Does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly 
as a swift stream? He has come for me: the horse of the White Rider. We are 




going to battle together.' 

Even as the old wizard spoke, the great horse came striding up the 
slope towards them; his coat was glistening and his mane flowing in the wind 
of his speed. The two others followed, now far behind. As soon as Shadowfax 
saw Gandalf, he checked his pace and whinnied loudly; then trotting gently 
forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the 
old man's neck. 

Gandalf caressed him. 'It is a long way from Rivendell, my friend,' he 
said; 'but you are wise and swift and come at need. Far let us ride now 
together, and part not in this world again!' 

Soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting 
orders. 'We go at once to Meduseld, the hall of your master, Thjoden,' said 
Gandalf, addressing them gravely. They bowed their heads. 'Time presses, so 
with your leave, my friends, we will ride. We beg you to use all the speed 
that you can. Hasufel shall bear Aragorn and Arod Legolas. I will set Gimli 
before me, and by his leave Shadowfax shall bear us both. We will wait now 
only to drink a little.' 

'Now I understand a part of last night's riddle,' said Legolas as he 
sprang lightly upon Arod's back. 'Whether they fled at first in fear, or 
not, our horses met Shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. 

Did you know that he was at hand, Gandalf?' 

'Yes, I knew,' said the wizard. 'I bent my thought upon him, bidding 
him to make haste; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land. 
Swiftly may he bear me back again!' 

Gandalf spoke now to Shadowfax, and the horse set off at a good pace, 
yet not beyond the measure of the others. After a little while he turned 
suddenly, and choosing a place where the banks were lower, he waded the 
river, and then led them away due south into a flat land, treeless and wide. 

The wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of grass. There was 
no sign of road or track, but Shadowfax did not stay or falter. 

'He is steering a straight course now for the halls of Thjoden under 
the slopes of the White Mountains,' said Gandalf. 'It will be quicker so. 

The ground is firmer in the Eastemnet, where the chief northward track lies, 
across the river, but Shadowfax knows the way through every fen and hollow.' 

For many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands. Often the 
grass was so high that it reached above the knees of the riders, and their 




steeds seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea. They came upon many 
hidden 

pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs; but 
Shadowfax found the way, and the other horses followed in his swath. Slowly 
the sun fell from the sky down into the West. Looking out over the great 
plain, far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into 
the grass. Low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red 
upon either side. A smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun's disc to the 
hue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim 
of earth. 

’There lies the Gap of Rohan,' said Gandalf. 'It is now almost due west 
of us. That way lies Isengard.' 

'I see a great smoke,' said Legolas. 'What may that be?' 

'Battle and war!' said Gandalf. 'Ride on!' 




Chapter 6 . The King of the Golden Hall 



They rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gathering night. When 
at last they halted and dismounted, even Aragorn was stiff and weary. 
Gandalf only allowed them a few hours' rest. Legolas and Gimli slept and 
Aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but Gandalf stood, leaning on his 
staff, gazing into the darkness, east and west. All was silent, and there 
was no sign or sound of living thing. The night was barred with long clouds, 
fleeting on a chill wind, when they arose again. Under the cold moon they 
went on once more, as swift as by the light of day. 

Hours passed and still they rode on. Gimli nodded and would have fallen 
from his seat, if Gandalf had not clutched and shaken him. Hasufel and Arod, 
weary but proud, followed their tireless leader, a grey shadow before them 
hardly to he seen. The miles went by. The waxing moon sank into the cloudy 
West. 

A bitter chill came into the air. Slowly in the East the dark faded to 
a cold grey. Red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the Emyn 
Muil far away upon their left. Dawn came clear and bright; a wind swept 
across their path, rushing through the bent grasses. Suddenly Shadowfax 
stood still and neighed. Gandalf pointed ahead. 

'Look!' he cried, and they lifted their tired eyes. Before them stood 
the mountains of the South: white-tipped and streaked with black. The 
grass-lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet, and 
flowed up into many valleys still dim and dark, untouched by the light of 
dawn, winding their way into the heart of the great mountains. Immediately 
before the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf 
among the hills. Far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with one 
tall peak; at the mouth of the vale there stood like sentinel a lonely 
height. About its feet there flowed, as a thread of silver, the stream that 
issued from the dale; upon its brow they caught, still far away, a glint in 
the rising sun, a glimmer of gold. ’Speak, Legolas!' said Gandalf. 'Tell us 
what you see there before us!' 

Legolas gazed ahead, shading his eyes from the level shafts of the 
new-risen sun. 'I see a white stream that comes down from the snows,' he 
said. 'Where it issues from the shadow of the vale a green hill rises upon 




the east. A dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it. Within there 
rise the roofs of houses; and in the midst, set upon a green terrace, there 
stands aloft a great hall of Men. And it seems to my eyes that it is 
thatched with gold. The light of it shines far over the land. Golden, too, 
are the posts of its doors. There men in bright mail stand; but all else 
within the courts are yet asleep.’ 

'Edoras those courts are called,’ said Gandalf, ’and Meduseld is that 
golden hall. There dwells Thjoden son of Thengel, King of the Mark of Rohan. 
We are come with the rising of the day. Now the road lies plain to see 
before us. But we must ride more warily; for war is abroad, and the 
Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, do not sleep, even if it seem so from afar. Draw 
no weapon, speak no haughty word, I counsel you all, until we are come 
before Thjoden’s seat.’ 

The morning was bright and clear about them, and birds were singing, 
when the travellers came to the stream. It ran down swiftly into the plain, 
and beyond the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide bend, 
flowing away east to feed the Entwash far off in its reed-choked beds. The 
land was green: in the wet meads and along the grassy borders of the stream 
grew many willow-trees. Already in this southern land they were blushing red 
at their fingertips. Feeling the approach of spring. Over the stream there 
was a ford between low banks much trampled by the passage of horses. The 
travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the 
uplands. 

At the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of many 
mounds, high and green. Upon their western sides the grass was white as with 
a drifted snow: small flowers sprang there like countless stars amid the 
turf. 

’Look!’ said Gandalf. ’How fair are the bright eyes in the grass! 
Evermind they are called, simbelmynl in this land of Men, for they blossom 
in all the seasons of the year, and grow where dead men rest. Behold! we are 
come to the great barrows where the sires of Thjoden sleep.’ 'Seven mounds 
upon the left, and nine upon the right,’ said Aragorn. ’Many long lives of 
men it is since the golden hall was built.’ 

’Five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in Mirkwood in my home 
since then,’ said Legolas, 'and but a little while does that seem to us.’ 

’But to the Riders of the Mark it seems so long ago,’ said Aragorn, 

’that the raising of this house is but a memory of song, and the years 




before are lost in the mist of time. Now they call this land their home, 
their own, and their speech is sundered from their northern kin.' Then he 
began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the Elf and Dwarf; yet 
they listened, for there was a strong music in it. 

That, I guess, is the language of the Rohirrim,' said Legolas; 'for it 
is like to this land itself; rich and rolling in part, and else hard and 
stern as the mountains. But I cannot guess what it means, save that it is 
laden with the sadness of Mortal Men.' 

'It runs thus in the Common Speech,' said Aragorn, 'as near as I can 
make it. 

Where now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? 

Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing? 

Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing? 

Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing? 

They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow; 

The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow. 

Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning, 

Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning? 

Thus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in Rohan, recalling how tall and 
fair was Eorl the Young, who rode down out of the North; and there were 
wings upon the feet of his steed, Felaruf, father of horses. So men still 
sing in the evening.' 

With these words the travellers passed the silent mounds. Following the 
winding way up the green shoulders of the hills, they came at last to the 
wide wind-swept walls and the gates of Edoras. 

There sat many men in bright mail, who sprang at once to their feet and 
barred the way with spears. 'Stay, strangers here unknown!' they cried in 
the tongue of the Riddermark, demanding the names and errand of the 
strangers. Wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness; and they looked 
darkly upon Gandalf. 

'Well do I understand your speech,' he answered in the same language; 
'yet few strangers do so. Why then do you not speak in the Common Tongue, 
as 

is the custom in the West, if you wish to be answered?' 

'It is the will of Thjoden King that none should enter his gates, save 
those who know our tongue and are our friends,' replied one of the guards. 
'None are welcome here in days of war but our own folk, and those that come 




from Mundburg in the land of Gondor. Who are you that come heedless over 
the 

plain thus strangely clad, riding horses like to our own horses? Long have 
we kept guard here, and we have watched you from afar. Never have we seen 
other riders so strange, nor any horse more proud than is one of these that 
bear you. He is One of the Mearas, unless our eyes are cheated by some 
spell. Say, are you not a wizard, some spy from Saruman, or phantoms of his 
craft? Speak now and be swift!' 

'We are no phantoms,' said Aragorn, 'nor do your eyes cheat you. For 
indeed these are your own horses that we ride, as you knew well are you 
asked, I guess. But seldom does thief ride home to the stable. Here are 
Hasufel and Arod, that Jomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, lent to us, 
only two days ago. We bring them back now, even as we promised him. Has 
not 

Jomer then returned and given warning of our coming?' 

A troubled look came into the guard's eyes. 'Of Jomer I have naught to 
say,' he answered. 'If what you tell me is truth, then doubtless Thjoden 
will have heard of it. Maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked-for. It is 
but two nights ago that Wormtongue came to us and said that by the will of 
Thjoden no stranger should pass these gates.' 

'Wormtongue?' said Gandalf, looking sharply at the guard. 'Say no more! 

My errand is not to Wormtongue, but to the Lord of the Mark himself. I am in 
haste. Will you not go or send to say that we are come?' His eyes glinted 
under his deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man. 

'Yes, I will go,' he answered slowly. 'But what names shall I report? 

And what shall I say of you? Old and weary you seem now, and yet you are 
fell and grim beneath, I deem' 

'Well do you see and speak,' said the wizard. 'For I am Gandalf. I have 
returned. And behold! I too bring back a horse. Here is Shadowfax the Great, 
whom no other hand can tame. And here beside me is Aragorn son of 
Arathorn, 

the heir of Kings, and it is to Mundburg that he goes. Here also are Legolas 
the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf, our comrades. Go now and say to your master 
that we are at his gates and would have speech with him, if he will permit 
us to come into his hall.' 'Strange names you give indeed! But I will report 
them as you bid and learn my master's will,' said the guard. 'Wait here a 
little while, and f will bring you such answer as seems good to him. Do not 




hope too much! These are dark days.' He went swiftly away, leaving the 
strangers in the watchful keeping of his comrades. After some time he 
returned. ’Follow me!' he said. 'Thjoden gives you leave to enter; but any 
weapon that you bear; be it only a staff, you must leave on the threshold. 

The doorwardens will keep them.' 

The dark gates were swung open. The travellers entered, walking in file 
behind their guide. They found a broad path, paved with hewn stones, now 
winding upward, now climbing in short flights of well-laid steps. Many 
houses built of wood and many dark doors they passed. Beside the way in a 
stone channel a stream of clear water flowed, sparkling and chattering. At 
length they came to the crown of the hill. There stood a high platform above 
a green terrace, at the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a stone 
carved in the likeness of a horse's head; beneath was a wide basin from 
which the water, spilled and fed the falling stream. Up the green terrace 
went a stair of stone, high and broad, and on either side of the topmost 
step were stone-hewn sea, There sat other guards, with drawn swords laid 
upon their knees. Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun 
was blazoned upon their green shields, their long corslets were burnished 
bright, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men. 

’There are the doors before you,’ said the guide. ’I must return now to 
my duty at the gate. Farewell! And may the Lord of the Mark be gracious to 
you!’ 

He turned and went swiftly back down the road. The others climbed the 
long stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen. Silent they stood now above 
and spoke no word, until Gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the 
stairs head. Then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting 
in their own tongue. 

Hail, corners from afar!’ they said, and they turned the hilts of their 
swords towards the travellers in token of peace. Green gems flashed in the 
sunlight. Then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the Common 
Speech. 

’I am the Doorward of Thjoden,’ he said. ’Hbma is my name. Here I must 
bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter.’ 

Then Legolas gave into his hand his silver -hafted knife, his quiver and 
his bow. ’Keep these well,’ he said, ’for they come from the Golden Wood and 
the Lady of Lothlurien gave them to me.’ 

Wonder came into the man’s eyes, and he laid the weapons hastily by the 




wall, as if he feared to handle them. 'No man will touch them I promise 
you,' he said. 

Aragorn stood a while hesitating. 'It is not my will,' he said, 'to put 
aside my sword or to deliver And®ril to the hand of any other man.' 

'It is the will of Thjoden,' said Hbma. 

'It is not clear to me that the will of Thjoden son of Thengel even 
though he be lord of the Mark, should prevail over the will of Aragorn son 
of Arathorn, Elendil's heir of Gondor.' 

'This is the house of Thjoden, not of Aragorn, even were he King of 
Gondor in the seat of Denethor,' said Hbma, stepping swiftly before the 
doors and barring the way. His sword was now in his hand and the point 
towards the strangers. 

'This is idle talk,' said Gandalf. 'Needless is Thjoden's demand, but 
it is useless to refuse. A king will have his way in his own hall, be it 
folly or wisdom.' 

'Truly,' said Aragorn. 'And I would do as the master of the house bade 
me, were this only a woodman's cot, if I bore now any sword but And®ril.' 

'Whatever its name may be,' said Hbma, 'here you shall lay it, if you 
would not fight alone against all the men in Edoras.' 

'Not alone!' said Gimli, fingering the blade of his axe, and looking 
darkly up at the guard, as if he were a young tree that Gimli had a mind to 
fell. 'Not alone!' 

'Come, come!' said Gandalf. 'We are all friends here. Or should be; for 
the laughter of Mordor will be our only reward, if we quarrel. My errand is 
pressing. Here at least is my sword, goodman Hbma. Keep it well. Glamdring 
it is called, for the Elves made it long ago. Now let me pass. Come, 
Aragorn!' 

Slowly Aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword upright 
against the wall. 'Here I set it,' he said; 'but I command you not to touch 
it, nor to permit any other to lay hand on it. In this elvish heath dwells 
the Blade that was Broken and has been made again. Telchar first wrought it 
in the deeps of time. Death shall come to any man that draws Elendil's sword 
save Elendil's heir.' 

The guard stepped back and looked with amazement on Aragorn. 'It seems 
that you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten days he said. It 
shall be, lord, as you command. 

'Well,' said Gimli, 'if it has And®ril to keep it company, my axe may 




stay here, too, without shame’; and he laid it on the floor. 'Now then, if 
all is as you wish, let us go and speak with your master.’ 

The guard still hesitated. ’Your staff,' he said to Gandalf. ’Forgive 
me, but that too must be left at the doors.' 

’Foolishness!' said Gandalf. 'Prudence is one thing, but discourtesy is 
another. I am old. If I may not lean on my stick as I go, then I will sit 
out here, until it pleases Thjoden to hobble out himself to speak with me.’ 

Aragorn laughed. ’Every man has something too dear to trust to another. 
But would you part an old man from his support? Come, will you not let us 
enter?' 

'The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age’ 
said Hbma. He looked hard at the ash-staff on which Gandalf leaned. 'Yet in 
doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom. I believe you are friends 
and folk worthy of honour, who have no evil purpose. You may go in.' 

The guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly 
inwards grumbling on their great hinges. The travellers entered. Inside it 
seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill. The hall was long 
and wide and filled with shadows and half lights; mighty pillars upheld its 
lofty roof. But here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts 
from the eastern windows, high under the deep eaves. Through the louver in 
the roof, above the thin wisps of issuing smoke, the sky showed pale and 
blue. As their eyes changed, the travellers perceived that the floor was 
paved with stones of many hues; branching runes and strange devices 
intertwined beneath their feet. They saw now that the pillars were richly 
carved, gleaming dully with gold and half-seen colours. Many woven cloths 
were hung upon the walls, and over their wide spaces marched figures of 
ancient legend, some dim with years, some darkling in the shade. But upon 
one form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a white horse. He was blowing a 
great horn, and his yellow hair was flying in the wind. The horse's head was 
lifted, and its nostrils were wide and red as it neighed, smelling battle 
afar. Foaming water, green and white, rushed and curled about its knees. 

'Behold Eorl the Young!' said Aragorn. 'Thus he rode out of the North 
to the Battle of the Field of Celebrant.' 

Now the four companions went forward, past the clear wood-fire burning 
upon the long hearth in the midst of the hall. Then they halted. At the far 
end of the house, beyond the hearth and facing north towards the doors, was 
a dais with three steps; and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded 




chair. Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but 
his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a 
thin golden circle set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone 
a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his 
eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the 
strangers. Behind his chair stood a woman clad in white. At his feet upon 
the steps sat a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face and 
heavy -lidded eyes. 

There was a silence. The old man did not move in his chair. At length 
Gandalf spoke. 'Hail, Thjoden son of Thengel! I have returned. For behold! 
the storm comes, and now all friends should gather together, lest each 
singly be destroyed.' 

Slowly the old man rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon a short black 
staff with a handle of white bone; and now the strangers saw that, bent 
though he was, he was still tall and must in youth have been high and proud 
indeed. 

'I greet you,' he said, 'and maybe you look for welcome. But truth to 
tell your welcome is doubtful here, Master Gandalf. You have ever been a 
herald of woe. Troubles follow you like crows, and ever the oftener the 
worse. I will not deceive you: when I heard that Shadowfax had come back 
riderless, I rejoiced at the return of the horse, but still more at the lack 
of the rider; and when Jomer brought the tidings that you had gone at last 
to your long home, I did not mourn. But news from afar is seldom sooth. Here 
you come again! And with you come evils worse than before, as might be 
expected. Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? Tell me that.' 
Slowly 

he sat down again in his chair. 

'You speak justly, lord,' said the pale man sitting upon the steps of 
the dais. 'It is not yet five days since the bitter tidings came that 
Thjodred your son was slain upon the West Marches: your right hand, Second 
Marshal Of the Mark. In Jomer there is little trust. Few men would be left 
to guard your walls, if he had been allowed to rule. And even now we learn 
from Gondor that the Dark Lord is stirring in the East. Such is the hour in 
which this wanderer chooses to return. Why indeed should we welcome you, 
Master Stormcrow? Lbthspell I name you, Ill-news; and ill news is an ill 
guest they say.' He laughed grimly, as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment 
and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes. 




’You are held wise, my friend Wormtongue, and are doubtless a great 
support to your master,’ answered Gandalf in a soft voice. 'Yet in two ways 
may a man come with evil tidings, lie may be a worker of evil; or he may be 
such as leaves well alone, and comes only to bring aid in time of need.’ 

’That is so,’ said Wormtongue; ’but there is a third kind: pickers of 
bones, meddlers in other men’s sorrows, carrion-fowl that grow fat on war. 
What aid have you ever brought, Stormcrow? And what aid do you bring now? 
It 

was aid from us that you sought last time that you were here. Then my lord 
bade you Choose any horse that you would and be gone; and to the wonder of 
all you took Shadowfax in your insolence. My lord was sorely grieved; yet to 
some it seemed that to speed you from the land the price was not too great. 

I guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid 
rather than render it. Do you bring men? Do you bring horses, swords, 
spears? That I would call aid; that is our present need. But who are these 
that follow at your tail? Three ragged wanderers in grey, and you yourself 
the most beggar-like of the four!’ 

’The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Thjoden son of 
Thengel,’ said Gandalf. ’Has not the messenger from your gate reported the 
names of my companions? Seldom has any lord of Rohan received three 
such 

guests. Weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth many a mortal 
man, even the mightiest. Grey is their raiment, for the Elves clad them, and 
thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall.’ 

’Then it is true, as Jomer reported, that you are in league with the 
Sorceress of the Golden Wood?’ said Wormtongue. ’It is not to be wondered 
at: webs of deceit were ever woven in Dwimordene.’ 

Gimli strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of Gandalf 
clutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone. 

In Dwimordene, in Lurien 
Seldom have walked the feet of Men, 

Few mortal eyes have seen the light 
That lies there ever, long and bright. 

Galadriel! Galadriel! 

Clear is the water of your well; 

White is the star in your white hand; 

Unmarred, unstained is leaf and land 




In Dwimordene, in Lurien 

More fair than thoughts of Mortal Men. 

Thus Gandalf softly sang, and then suddenly he changed. Casting his 
tattered cloak aside, he stood up and leaned no longer on his staff; and he 
spoke in a clear cold voice. The wise speak only of what they know, Grnma 
son of Gblmud. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and 
keep 

your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and 
death to bandy crooked words with a serving -man till the lightning falls.' 

He raised his staff. There was a roll of thunder. The sunlight was blotted 
out from the eastern windows; the whole hall became suddenly dark as night. 
The fire faded to sullen embers. Only Gandalf could be seen, standing white 
and tall before the blackened hearth. 

In the gloom they heard the hiss of Wormtongue's voice: 'Did I not 
counsel you, lord, to forbid his staff? That fool, Hbma, has betrayed us!' 
There was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof. Then all was silent. 
Wormtongue sprawled on his face. 

'Now Thjoden son of Thengel, will you hearken to me?' said Gandalf. 'Do 
you ask for help?' He lifted his staff and pointed to a high window. There 
the darkness seemed to clear, and through the opening could be seen, high 
and far, a patch of shining sky. 'Not all is dark. Take courage, Lord of the 
Mark; for better help you will not find. No counsel have I to give to those 
that despair. Yet counsel I could give, and words I could speak to you. Will 
you hear them? They are not for all ears. I bid you come out before your 
doors and look abroad. Too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to 
twisted tales and crooked promptings.' 

Slowly Thjoden left his chair. A faint light grew in the hall again. 

The woman hastened to the king's side, taking his arm, and with faltering 
steps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall. 
Wormtongue remained lying on the floor. They came to the doors and 
Gandalf 
knocked. 

'Open!' he cried. 'The Lord of the Mark comes forth!' 

The doors rolled back and a keen air came whistling in. A wind was 
blowing on the hill. 'Send your guards down to the stairs foot,' said 
Gandalf. 'And you, lady, leave him a while with me. I will care for him.' 

'Go, Jowyn sister-daughter!' said the old king. 'The time for fear is 




past.' 

The woman turned and went slowly into the house. As she passed the 
doors she turned and looked back. Grave and thoughtful was her glance, as 
she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes. Very fair was her face, 
and her long hair was like a river of gold. Slender and tall she was in her 
white robe girt with silver; but strong she seemed and stern as steel, a 
daughter of kings. Thus Aragorn for the first time in the full light of day 
beheld Jowyn, Lady of Rohan, and thought her fair, fair and cold, like a 
morning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood. And she now was 
suddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings, wise with many winters, 
greycloaked. Hiding a power that yet she felt. For a moment still as stone 
she stood, then turning swiftly she was gone. 

'Now, lord,' said Gandalf, 'look out upon your land! Breathe the free 
air again!' 

From the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see beyond 
the stream the green fields of Rohan fading into distant grey. Curtains of 
wind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and to the west was still 
dark with thunder, and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden 
hills. But the wind had shifted to the north, and already the storm that had 
come out of the East was receding, rolling away southward to the sea. 
Suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed 
down. The falling showers gleamed like silver, and far away the river 
glittered like a shimmering glass. 

'It is not so dark here,' said Thjoden. 

'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as 
some would have you think. Cast aside your prop!' 

From the king's hand the black staff fell clattering on the stones. He 
drew himself up, slowly, as a man that is stiff from long bending over some 
dull toil. Now tall and straight he stood, and his eyes were blue as he 
looked into the opening sky. 

'Dark have been my dreams of late,' he said, 'but I feel as one 
new-awakened. I would now that you had come before, Gandalf. For I fear that 
already you have come too late, only to see the last days of my house. Not 
long now shall stand the high hall which Brego son of Eorl built. Fire shall 
devour the high seat. What is to be done?' 

'Much,' said Gandalf. 'But first send for Jomer. Do I not guess rightly 
that you hold him prisoner, by the counsel of Grnma, of him that all save 




you name the Wormtongue?' 

'It is true,' said Thjoden. 'He had rebelled against my commands, and 
threatened death to Grnma in my hall.' 

'A man may love you and yet not love Wormtongue or his counsels' said 
Gandalf. 

'That may be. I will do as you ask. Call Hbma to me. Since he proved 
untrusty as a doorward, let him become an errand -runner. The guilty shall 
bring the guilty to judgement,' said Thjoden, and his voice was grim, yet he 
looked at Gandalf and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were 
smoothed away and did not return. 

When Hbma had been summoned and had gone, Gandalf led Thjoden to 
a 

stone seat, and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair. 
Aragorn and his companions stood nearby. 

'There is no time to tell all that you should hear,' said Gandalf. 'Yet 
if my hope is not cheated, a time will come ere long when I can speak more 
fully. Behold! you are come into a peril greater even than the wit of 
Wormtongue could weave into your dreams. But see! you dream no longer. 
You 

live. Gondor and Rohan do not stand alone. The enemy is strong beyond our 
reckoning, yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed.' 

Quickly now Gandalf spoke. His voice was low and secret, and none save 
the king heard what he said. But ever as he spoke the light shone brighter 
in Thjoden's eye, and at the last he rose from his seat to his full height, 
and Gandalf beside him, and together they looked out from the high place 
towards the East. 

'Verily,' said Gandalf, now in a loud voice, keen and clear, 'that way 
lies our hope, where sits our greatest fear. Doom hangs still on a thread. 

Yet hope there is still, if we can but stand unconquered for a little 
while.' 

The others too now turned their eyes eastward. Over the sundering 
leagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope and fear 
bore their thoughts still on, beyond dark mountains to the Land of Shadow. 
Where now was the Ring -bearer? How thin indeed was the thread upon 
which 

doom still hung! It seemed to Legolas, as he strained his farseeing eyes, 
that he caught a glint of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a 




pinnacle of the Tower of Guard. And further still, endlessly remote and yet 
a present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame. 

Slowly Thjoden sat down again, as if weariness still struggled to 
master him against the will of Gandalf. He turned and looked at his great 
house. 'Alas!' he said, 'that these evil days should be mine, and should 
come in my old age instead of that peace which I have earned. Alas for 
Boromir the brave! The young perish and the old linger, withering.' He 
clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands. 

'Your fingers would remember their old strength better, if they grasped 
a sword-hilt,' said Gandalf. 

Thjoden rose and put his hand to his side; but no sword hung at his 
belt. 'Where has Grnma stowed it?' he muttered under his breath. 

'Take this, dear lord!' said a clear voice. 'It was ever at your 
service.' Two men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps 
from the top. Jomer was there. No helm was on his head, no mail was on his 
breast, but in his hand he held a drawn sword; and as he knelt he offered 
the hilt to his master. 

'How comes this?' said Thjoden sternly. He turned towards Jomer and the 
men looked in wonder at him, standing now proud and erect. Where was the 
old 

man whom they had left crouching in his chair or leaning on his stick? 

'It is my doing, lord,' said Hbma, trembling. I understood that Jomer 
was to be set free. Such joy was in my heart that maybe I have erred. Yet, 
since he was free again, and he a Marshal of the Mark, ! brought him his 
sword as he bade me.' 

'To lay at your feet, my lord,' said Jomer. 

For a moment of silence Thjoden stood looking down at Jomer as he knelt 
still before him. Neither moved. 

'Will you not take the sword?' said Gandalf. 

Slowly Thjoden stretched forth his hand. As his fingers took the hilt, 
it seemed to the watchers that firmness and strength returned to his thin 
arm. Suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistling in 
the air. Then he gave a great cry. His voice rang clear as he chanted in the 
tongue of Rohan a call to arms. 

Arise now, arise, Riders of Thjoden! 

Dire deeds awake, dark is it eastward. 

Let horse be bridled, horn be sounded! 




Forth Eorlingas! 

The guards, thinking that they were summoned, sprang up the stair. They 
looked at their lord in amazement, and then as one man they drew their 
swords and laid them at his feet. 'Command us!’ they said. 

'Westu Thjoden hbl!' cried Jomer. ’It is a joy to us to see you return 
into your own. Never again shall it be said, Gandalf, that you come only 
with grief!’ 

'Take back your sword, Jomer, sister-son!' said the king. 'Go, Hbma, 
and seek my own sword! Grnma has it in his keeping. Bring him to me also. 
Now, Gandalf, you said that you had counsel to give, if I would hear it. 

What is your counsel?' 

'You have yourself already taken it,' answered Gandalf. 'To put your 
trust in Jomer, rather than in a man of crooked mind. To cast aside regret 
and fear. To do the deed at hand. Every man that can ride should be sent 
west at once, as Jomer counselled you: we must first destroy the threat of 
Saruman, while we have time. If we fail, we fall. If we succeed — then we 
will face the next task. Meanwhile your people that are left, the women and 
the children and the old, should stay to the refuges that you have in the 
mountains. Were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this? Let 
them take provision, but delay not, nor burden themselves with treasures, 
great or small. It is their lives that are at stake.' 

'This counsel seems good to me now,' said Thjoden. 'Let all my folk get 
ready ! But you my guests-truly you said, Gandalf, that the courtesy of my 
hall is lessened. You have ridden through the night, and the morning wears 
away. You have had neither sleep nor food. A guest-house shall be made 
ready: there you shall sleep, when you have eaten.' 

'Nay, lord,' said Aragorn. 'There is no rest yet for the weary. The men 
of Rohan must ride forth today, and we will ride with them, axe, sword, and 
bow. We did not bring them to rest against your wall, Lord of the Mark. And 
I promised Jomer that my sword and his should be drawn together.' 

'Now indeed there is hope of victory!' said Jomer. 

'Hope, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But Isengard is strong. And other perils 
draw ever nearer. Do not delay, Thjoden, when we are gone. Lead your people 
swiftly to the Hold of Dunharrow in the hills!' 

'Nay, Gandalf!' said the king. 'You do not know your own skill in 
healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front 
of the battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' 




'Then even the defeat of Rohan will be glorious in song,' said Aragorn. 

The armed men that stood near clashed their weapons, crying: 'The Lord of 
the Mark will ride! Forth Eorlingas!' 

'But your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless' said 
Gandalf. 'Who shall guide them and govern them in your place?' 

'I will take thought for that ere I go,' answered Thjoden. 'Here comes 
my counsellor.' 

At that moment Hbma came again from the hall. Behind him cringing 
between two other men, came Grnma the Wormtongue. His face was very 
white. 

His eyes blinked in the sunlight. Hbma knelt and presented to Thjoden a long 
sword in a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems. 'Here, lord, 
is Herugrim, your ancient blade,' he said. 'It was found in his chest. Loth 
was he to render up the keys. Many other things are there which men have 
missed.' 

'You lie,' said Wormtongue. 'And this sword your master himself gave 
into my keeping.' 

'And he now requires it of you again,' said Thjoden. 'Does that 
displease you?' 

'Assuredly not. lord,' said Wormtongue. 'I care for you and yours as 
best I may. But do not weary yourself, or tax too heavily your strength. Let 
others deal with these irksome guests. Your meat is about to be set on the 
board. Will you not go to it?' 

'I will,' said Thjoden. 'And let food for my guests be set on the board 
beside me. The host rides today. Send the heralds forth! Let them summon all 
who dwell nigh! Every man and strong lad able to bear arms, all who have 
horses, let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour from 
noon!' 

'Dear lord!' cried Wormtongue. 'It is as I feared. This wizard has 
bewitched you. Are none to be left to defend the Golden Hall of your 
fathers, and all your treasure? None to guard the Lord of the Mark?' 

'If this is bewitchment,' said Thjoden, 'it seems to me more wholesome 
than your whisperings. Your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on 
all fours like a beast. No, not one shall be left, not even Grnma. Grnma 
shall ride too. Go! You have yet time to clean the rust from your sword.' 

'Mercy, lord!' whined Wormtongue, grovelling on the ground. 'Have pity 
on one worn out in your service. Send me not from your side! I at least will 




stand by you when all others have gone. Do not send your faithful Grnma 
away!' 

'You have my pity,' said Thjoden. 'And I do not send you from my side. 

I go myself to war with my men. I bid you come with me and prove your 
faith.' 

Wormtongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted look of 
a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies. He licked his lips with 
a long pale tongue. 'Such a resolve might be expected from a lord of the 
House of Eorl, old though he be,' he said. 'But those who truly love him 
would spare his failing years. Yet I see that I come too late. Others, whom 
the death of my lord would perhaps grieve less, have already persuaded him. 

If I cannot undo their work, hear me at least in this, lord! One who knows 
your mind and honours your commands should be left in Edoras. Appoint a 
faithful steward. Let your counsellor Grnma keep all things till your 
return-and I pray that we may see it, though no wise man will deem it 
hopeful.' 

Jomer laughed. 'And if that plea does not excuse you from war, most 
noble Wormtongue,' he said, what office of less honour would you accept? To 
carry a sack of meal up into the mountains-if any man would trust you with 
it?' 

'Nay, Jomer, you do not fully understand the mind of Master 
Wormtongue,' said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him. 'He is bold 
and cunning. Even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw. Hours of 
my precious time he has wasted already. 'Down snake!' he said suddenly in a 
terrible voice. 'Down on your belly! How long is it since Saruman bought 
you? What was the promised price? When all the men were dead, you were to 
pick your share of the treasure, and take the woman you desire? Too long 
have you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps.' 

Jomer grasped his sword. 'That I knew already,' he muttered. 'For that 
reason I would have slain him before, forgetting the law of the hall. But 
there are other reasons.' He stepped forward, but Gandalf stayed him with 
his hand. 

'Jowyn is safe now,' he said. 'But you, Wormtongue, you have done what 
you could for your true master. Some reward you have earned at least. Yet 
Saruman is apt to overlook his bargains. I should advise you to go quickly 
and remind him, lest he forget your faithful service.' 

'You lie,' said Wormtongue. 




'That word comes too oft and easy from your lips,' said Gandalf. ’I do 
not lie. See, Thjoden, here is a snake! With safety you cannot take it with 
you, nor can you leave it behind. To slay it would be just. But it was not 
always as it now is. Once it was a man, and did you service in its fashion. 
Give him a horse and let him go at once, wherever he chooses. By his choice 
you shall judge him.’ 

'Do you hear this, Wormtongue?' said Thjoden. 'This is your choice: to 
ride with me to war, and let us see in battle whether you are true; or to go 
now, whither you will. But then, if ever we meet again, I shall not be 
merciful.' 

Slowly Wormtongue rose. He looked at them with half-closed eyes. Last 
of all he scanned Thjoden's face and opened his mouth as if to speak. Then 
suddenly he drew himself up. His hands worked. His eyes glittered. Such 
malice was in them that men stepped back from him. He bared his teeth; and 
then with a hissing breath he spat before the king's feet, and darting to 
one side, he fled down the stair. 

'After him!' said Thjoden. 'See that he does no harm to any, but do not 
hurt him or hinder him. Give him a horse, if he wishes it.' 

'And if any will bear him,' said Jomer. 

One of the guards ran down the stair. Another went to the well at the 
foot of the terrace and in his helm drew water. With it he washed clean the 
stones that Wormtongue had defiled. 

'Now my guests, come!' said Thjoden. 'Come and take such refreshment as 
haste allows.' 

They passed back into the great house. Already they heard below them in 
the town the heralds crying and the war -horns blowing. For the king was to 
ride forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be 
armed and assembled. 

At the king's board sat Jomer and the four guests, and there also 
waiting upon the king was the lady Jowyn. They ate and drank swiftly. The 
others were silent while Thjoden questioned Gandalf concerning Saruman. 

'How far back his treachery goes, who can guess?' said Gandalf. 'He was 
not always evil. Once I do not doubt that he was the friend of Rohan; and 
even when his heart grew colder, he found you useful still. But for long now 
he has plotted your ruin, wearing the mask of Friendship, until he was 
ready. In those years Wormtongue's task was easy, and all that you did was 
swiftly known in Isengard; for your land was open, and strangers came and 




went. And ever Wormtongue's whispering was in your ears, poisoning your 
thought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and 
could do nothing, for your will was in his keeping. 

'But when I escaped and warned you, then the mask was torn, for those 
who would see. After that Wormtongue played dangerously, always seeking 
to 

delay you, to prevent your full strength being gathered. He was crafty: 
dulling men's wariness, or working on their fears, as served the occasion. 

Do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on 
a 

wildgoose chase northward, when the immediate peril was westward? He 
persuaded you to forbid Jomer to pursue the raiding Ores. If Jomer had not 
defied Wormtongue's voice speaking with your mouth, those Ores would 
have 

reached Isengard by now, bearing a great prize. Not indeed that prize which 
Saruman desires above all else, but at the least two members of my Company, 
sharers of a secret hope, of which even to you, lord, I cannot yet speak 
openly. Dare you think of what they might now be suffering, or what Saruman 
might now have learned to our destruction?' 

'I owe much to Jomer,' said Thjoden. 'Faithful heart may have forward 
tongue.' 'Say also,' said Gandalf, 'that to crooked eyes truth may wear a 
wry face.' 

'Indeed my eyes were almost blind,' said Thjoden. 'Most of all I owe to 
you, my guest. Once again you have come in time. I would give you a gift ere 
we go, at your own choosing. You have only to name aught that is mine. I 
reserve now only my sword!' 

'Whether I came in time or not is yet to be seen,' said Gandalf. 'But 
as for your gift, lord, I will choose one that will fit my need: swift and 
sure. Give me Shadowfax! He was only lent before, if loan we may call it. 
But now shall ride him into great hazard, setting silver against black: I 
would not risk anything that is not my own. And already there is a bond of 
love between us.' 

'You choose well,' said Thjoden; 'and I give him now gladly. Yet it is 
a great gift. There is none like to Shadowfax. In him one of the mighty 
steeds of old has returned. None such shall return again. And to you my 
other guests I will offer such things as may be found in my armoury. Swords 
you do not need, but there are helms and coats of mail of cunning work, 




gifts to my fathers out of Gondor. Choose from these ere we go, and may they 
serve you well!' 

Now men came bearing raiment of war from the king's hoard and they 
arrayed Aragorn and Legolas in shining mail. Helms too they chose, and round 
shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and 
red and white. Gandalf took no armour; and Gimli needed no coat of rings, 
even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in 
the hoards of Edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath 
the Mountain in the North. But he chose a cap of iron and leather that 
fitted well upon his round head; and a small shield he also took. It bore 
the running horse, white upon green, that was the emblem of the House of 
Eorl. 

'May it keep you well!' said Thjoden. 'It was made for me in Thengel's 
day, while still I was a boy.' 

Gimli bowed. 'I am proud, Lord of the Mark, to bear your device,' he 
said. 'Indeed sooner would I bear a horse than be borne by one. I love my 
feet better. But, maybe, I shall come yet where I can stand and fight.' 

'It may well be so,' said Thjoden. 

The king now rose, and at once Jowyn came forward bearing wine. 'Ferthu 
Thjoden hbl!' she said. 'Receive now this cup and drink in happy hour. 
Health be with thee at thy going and coming!' 

Thjoden drank from the cup, and she then proffered it to the guests. As 
she stood before Aragorn she paused suddenly and looked upon him, and her 
eyes were shining. And he looked down upon her fair face and smiled; but as 
he took the cup, his hand met hers, and he knew that she trembled at the 
touch. 'Hail Aragorn son of Arathorn!' she said. 'Hail Lady of Rohan!' he 
answered, but his face now was troubled and he did not smile. 

When they had all drunk, the king went down the hall to the doors. 

There the guards awaited him, and heralds stood, and all the lords and 
chiefs were gathered together that remained in Edoras or dwelt nearby. 

'Behold! I go forth, and it seems like to be my last riding,' said 
Thjoden. 'I have no child. Thjodred my son is slain. I name Jomer my 
sister-son to be my heir. If neither of us return, then choose a new lord as 
you will. But to some one I must now entrust my people that I leave behind, 
to rule them in my place. Which of you will stay?' 

No man spoke. 

'Is there none whom you would name? In whom do my people trust?' 




'In the House of Eorl,' answered Hbma. 

'But Jomer I cannot spare, nor would he stay,' said the king; 'and he 
is the last of that House.' 

'I said not Jomer,' answered Hbma. 'And he is not the last. There is 
Jowyn, daughter of Jomund, his sister. She is fearless and high-hearted. All 
love her. Let her be as lord to the Eorlingas, while we are gone.' 

'It shall be so,' said Thjoden. 'Let the heralds announce to the folk 
that the Lady Jowyn will lead them!' 

Then the king sat upon a seat before his doors, and Jowyn knelt before 
him and received from him a sword and a fair corslet. 'Larewell 
sister-daughter!' he said. 'Dark is the hour, yet maybe we shall return to 
the Golden Hall. But in Dunharrow the people may long defend themselves, 
and 

if the battle go ill, thither will come all who escape.' 'Speak not so!' she 
answered. 'A year shall I endure for every day that passes until your 
return.' But as she spoke her eyes went to Aragorn who stood nearby. 

'The king shall come again,' he said. 'Lear not! Not West but East does 
our doom await us.' 

The king now went down the stair with Gandalf beside him. The others 
followed. Aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate. Alone Jowyn 
stood before the doors of the house at the stair's head; the sword was set 
upright before her, and her hands were laid upon the hilt. She was clad now 
in mail and shone like silver in the sun. 

Gimli walked with Legolas. his axe on his shoulder. 'Well, at last we 
set off!' he said. 'Men need many words before deeds. My axe is restless in 
my hands. Though I doubt not that these Rohirrim are fell -handed when they 
come to it. Nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me. How shall I 
come to the battle? I wish I could walk and not bump like a sack at 
Gandalf 's saddlebow.' 

'A safer seat than many, I guess,' said Legolas. 'Yet doubtless Gandalf 
will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin; or Shadowfax 
himself. An axe is no weapon for a rider.' 

'And a Dwarf is no horseman. It is ore-necks I would hew, not shave the 
scalps of Men,' said Gimli, patting the haft of his axe. 

At the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in 
the saddle. More than a thousand were there mustered. Their spears were like 
a springing wood. Loudly and joyously they shouted as Thjoden came forth. 




Some held in readiness the king's horse, Snowmane, and others held the 
horses of Aragorn and Legolas. Gimli stood ill at ease, frowning, but Jomer 
came up to him, leading his horse. 

’Hail, Gimli Gluin’s son!’ he cried. ’I have not had time to learn 
gentle speech under your rod, as you promised. But shall we not put aside 
our quarrel? At least I will speak no evil again of the Lady of the Wood.’ 

’I will forget my wrath for a while, Jomer son of Jomund,' said Gimli; 

'but if ever you chance to see the Lady Galadriel with your eyes, then you 
shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies, or our friendship will end.' 

'So be it!’ said Jomer. 'But until that time pardon me, and in token of 
pardon ride with me, I beg. Gandalf will be at the head with the Lord of the 
Mark; but Firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.' 

'I thank you indeed,' said Gimli greatly pleased. 'I will gladly go 
with you, if Legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.' 

'It shall he so,' said Jomer. 'Legolas upon my left, and Aragorn upon 
my right, and none will dare to stand before us!' 

'Where is Shadowfax?' said Gandalf. 

'Running wild over the grass,' they answered. 'He will let no man 
handle him. There he goes, away down by the ford, like a shadow among the 
willows.' 

Gandalf whistled and called aloud the horse's name, and far away he 
tossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host like an 
arrow. 

'Were the breath of the West Wind to take a body visible, even so would 
it appear,' said Jomer, as the great horse ran up, until he stood before the 
wizard. 

'The gift seems already to be given,' said Thjoden. 'But hearken all! 

Here now I name my guest, Gandalf Greyhame, wisest of counsellors; most 
welcome of wanderers, a lord of the Mark, a chieftain of the Eorlingas while 
our kin shall last; and I give to him Shadowfax, prince of horses.' 

'I thank you, Thjoden King,' said Gandalf. Then suddenly he threw back 
his grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to horseback. He wore no 
helm nor mail. His snowy hair flew free in the wind, his white robes shone 
dazzling in the sun. 

'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn, and all took up the words. 

'Our King and the White Rider!' they shouted. 'Forth Eorlingas!' 

The trumpets sounded. The horses reared and neighed. Spear clashed on 




shield. Then the king raised his hand, and with a rush like the sudden onset 
of a great wind the last host of Rohan rode thundering into the West. Far 
over the plain Jowyn saw the glitter of their spears, as she stood still, 
alone before the doors of the silent house. 




Chapter 7. Helm's Deep 



The sun was already westering as they rode from Edoras, and the light 
of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to a golden 
haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the 
White Mountains, and this they followed, up and down in a green country, 
crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the 
Misty Mountains loomed; ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went 
by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind. 

The host rode on. Need drove them. Fearing to come too late, they rode 
with all the speed they could, pausing seldom. Swift and enduring were the 
steeds of Rohan, but there were many leagues to go. Forty leagues and more 
it was, as a bird flies, from Edoras to the fords of the Isen, where they 
hoped to find the king’s men that held back the hosts of Saruman. 

Night closed about them. At last they halted to make their camp. They 
had ridden for some five hours and were far out upon the western plain, yet 
more than half their journey lay still before them. In a great circle, under 
the starry sky and the waxing moon, they now made their bivouac. They lit no 
fires, for they were uncertain of events; but they set a ring of mounted 
guards about them, and scouts rode out far ahead, passing like shadows in 
the folds of the land. The slow night passed without tidings or alarm. At 
dawn the horns sounded, and within an hour they took the road again. 

There were no clouds overhead yet, but a heaviness was in the air; it 
was hot for the season of the year. The rising sun was hazy, and behind it, 
following it slowly up the sky, there was a growing darkness, as of a great 
storm moving out of the East. And away in the North-west there seemed to be 
another darkness brooding about the feet of the Misty Mountains, a shadow 
that crept down slowly from the Wizard's Vale. 

Gandalf dropped back to where Legolas rode beside Jomer. ’You have the 
keen eyes of your fair kindred, Legolas,’ he said; ’and they can tell a 
sparrow from a finch a league off. Tell me, can you sec anything away yonder 
towards Isengard?’ 

’Many miles lie between,’ said Legolas, gazing thither and shading his 
eyes with his long hand. ’I can see a darkness. There are shapes moving in 
it, great shapes far away upon the bank of the river; but what they are I 




cannot tell. It is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes: there is a 
veiling shadow that some power lays upon the land, and it marches slowly 
down stream. It is as if the twilight under endless trees were flowing 
downwards from the hills.' 

'And behind us comes a very storm of Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'It will be 
a black night.' 

As the second day of their riding drew on, the heaviness in the air 
increased. In the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre 
canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light. The sun went 
down, blood-red in a smoking haze. The spears of the Riders were tipped with 
fire as the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of 
Thrihyrne: now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the White 
Mountains, three jagged horns staring at the sunset. In the last red glow 
men in the vanguard saw a black speck, a horseman riding back towards them. 
They halted awaiting him. 

He came, a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield. Slowly he 
climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping. At length he spoke. 

'Is Jomer here?' he asked. 'You come at last, but too late, and with too 
little strength. Things have gone evilly since Thjodred fell. We were driven 
back yesterday over the Isen with great loss; many perished at the crossing. 
Then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp. All 
Isengard must be emptied; and Saruman has armed the wild hillmen and 
herd-folk of Dunland beyond the rivers, and these also he loosed upon us. We 
were overmastered. The shield- wall was broken. Erkenbrand of Westfold has 
drawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in Helm's Deep. The 
rest are scattered. 

'Where is Jomer? Tell him there is no hope ahead. He should return to 
Edoras before the wolves of Isengard come there.' Thjoden had sat silent, 
hidden from the man's sight behind his guards; now he urged his horse 
forward. 'Come, stand before me, Ceorl!' he said. 'I am here. The last host 
of the Eorlingas has ridden forth. It will not return without battle.' 

The man's face lightened with joy and wonder. He drew himself up. Then 
he knelt, offering his notched sword to the king. 'Command me, lord!' he 
cried. 'And pardon me! I thought—' 

'You thought I remained in Meduseld bent like an old tree under winter 
snow. So it was when you rode to war. But a west wind has shaken the 
boughs,' said Thjoden. 'Give this man a fresh horse! Let us ride to the help 




of Erkenbrand!' 

While Thjoden was speaking, Gandalf rode a short way ahead, and he sat 
there alone, gazing north to Isengard and west to the setting sun. Now he 
came back. 

'Ride, Thjoden!' he said. 'Ride to Helm's Deep! Go not to the Fords of 
Isen, and do not tarry in the plain! I must leave you for a while. Shadowfax 
must bear me now on a swift errand.' Turning to Aragorn and Jomer and the 
men of the king's household, he cried: 'Keep well the Lord of the Mark, till 
I return. Await me at Helm's Gate! Farewell!' 

He spoke a word to Shadowfax, and like an arrow from the bow the great 
horse sprang away. Even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the 
sunset, a wind over the grass, a shadow that fled and passed from sight. 
Snowmane snorted and reared, eager to follow; but only a swift bird on the 
wing could have overtaken him. 

'What does that mean?' said one of the guard to Hbma. 

'That Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste,' answered Hbma. 'Ever he goes 
and comes unlooked-for:' 

'Wormtongue, were he here, would not find it hard to explain 'Said the 
other. 

'True enough,' said Hbma; 'but for myself, I will wait until I see 
Gandalf again.' 

'Maybe you will wait long,' said the other. 

The host turned away now from the road to the Fords of Isen and bent 
their course southward. Night fell, and still they rode on. The hills drew 
near, but the tall peaks of Thrihyrne were already dim against the darkening 
sky. Still some miles away, on the far side of the Westfold Vale, lay a 
green coomb, a great bay in the mountains, out of which a gorge opened in 
the hills. Men of that land called it Helm's Deep, after a hero of old wars 
who had made his refuge there. Ever steeper and narrower it wound inward 
from the north under the shadow of the Thrihyrne, till the crow-haunted 
cliffs rose like mighty towers on either side, shutting out the light. 

At Helm's Gate, before the mouth of the Deep, there was a heel of rock 
thrust outward by the northern cliff. There upon its spur stood high walls 
of ancient stone, and within them was a lofty tower. Men said that in the 
far-off days of the glory of Gondor the sea-kings had built here this 
fastness with the hands of giants. The Hornburg it was called, for a trumpet 
sounded upon the tower echoed in the Deep behind, as if armies 




long -forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills. A wall, 
too, the men of old had made from the Hornburg to the southern cliff, 
barring the entrance to the gorge. Beneath it by a wide culvert the 
Deeping-stream passed out. About the feet of the Hornrock it wound, and 
flowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore, sloping 
gently down from Helm's Gate to Helm's Dike. Thence it fell into the 
Deeping-coomb and out into the Westfold Vale. There in the Hornburg at 
Helm's Gate Erkenbrand, master of Westfold on the borders of the Mark, now 
dwelt. As the days darkened with threat of war, being wise, he had repaired 
the wall and made the fastness strong. 

The Riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the Coomb, 
when cries and hornblasts were heard from their scouts that went in front. 

Out of the darkness arrows whistled. Swiftly a scout rode back and reported 
that wolf-riders were abroad in the valley, and that a host of Ores and wild 
men were hurrying southward from the Fords of Isen and seemed to be 
making 

for Helm's Deep. 

'We have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither,' said 
the scout. 'And we have met scattered companies, going this way and that, 
leaderless. What has become of Erkenbrand none seem to know. It is likely 
that he will be overtaken ere he can reach Helm's Gate, if he has not 
already perished.' 

'Has aught been seen of Gandalf?' asked Thjoden. 

'Yes, lord. Many have seen an old man in white upon a horse, passing 
hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass. Some thought he 
was Saruman. It is said that he went away ere nightfall towards Isengard. 
Some say also that Wormtongue was seen earlier, going northward with a 
company of Ores.' 

'It will go ill with Wormtongue, if Gandalf comes upon him said 
Thjoden. 'Nonetheless I miss now both my counsellors, the old and the new. 
But in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as Gandalf said, to 
Helm's Gate, whether Erkenbrand be there or no. Is it known how great is the 
host that comes from the North?' 

'It is very great,' said the scout. 'He that flies counts every foeman 
twice, yet I have spoken to stouthearted men, and I do not doubt that the 
main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here.' 

'Then let us be swift,' said Jomer. 'Let us drive through such foes as 




are already between us and the fastness. There are caves in Helm's Deep 
where hundreds may lie hid; and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills. 

Trust not to secret ways,' said the king. ’Saruman has long spied out 
this land. Still in that place our defence may last long. Let us go!' 

Aragorn and Legolas went now with Jomer in the van. On through the dark 
night they rode, ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed 
southward, higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains' feet. 
They found few of the enemy before them. Here and there they came upon 
roving bands of Ores; but they fled ere the Riders could take or slay them. 

'It will not be long I fear,' said Jomer, 'ere the coming of the king's 
host will be known to the leader of our enemies, Saruman or whatever captain 
he has sent forth.' 

The rumour of war grew behind them. Now they could hear, borne over the 
dark, the sound of harsh singing. They had climbed far up into the 
Deeping-coomb when they looked back. Then they saw torches countless 
points 

of fiery light upon the black fields behind, scattered like red flowers, or 
winding up from the lowlands in long flickering lines. Here and there a 
larger blaze leapt up. 

'It is a great host and follows us hard,' said Aragorn. 

'They bring fire,' said Thjoden, 'and they are burning as they come, 
rick, cot, and tree. This was a rich vale and had many homesteads. Alas for 
my folk!' 

'Would that day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm 
out of the mountains!' said Aragorn. 'It grieves me to fly before them.' 

'We need not fly much further,' said Jomer. 'Not far ahead now lies 
Helm's Dike, an ancient trench and rampart scored across the coomb, two 
furlongs below Helm's Gate. There we can turn and give battle.' 

'Nay, we are too few to defend the Dike,' said Thjoden. 'It is a mile 
long or more, and the breach in it is wide.' 

'At the breach our rearguard must stand, if we are pressed,' said 
Jomer. 

There was neither star nor moon when the Riders came to the breach in 
the Dike, where the stream from above passed out, and the road beside it ran 
down from the Hornburg. The rampart loomed suddenly before them, a high 
shadow beyond a dark pit. As they rode up a sentinel challenged them. 

'The Lord of the Mark rides to Helm's Gate,' Jomer answered. 'I, Jomer 




son of Jomund, speak.' 

This is good tidings beyond hope,' said the sentinel. 'Hasten! The 
enemy is on your heels.' 

The host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward 
above. They now learned to their joy that Erkenbrand had left many men to 
hold Helm's Gate, and more had since escaped thither. 

'Maybe, we have a thousand fit to fight on foot,' said Gamling, an old 
man, the leader of those that watched the Dike. 'But most of them have seen 
too many winters, as I have, or too few, as my son's son here. What news of 
Erkenbrand? Word came yesterday that he was retreating hither with all that 
is left of the best Riders of Westfold. But he has not come.' 

'I fear that he will not come now,' said Jomer. 'Our scouts have gained 
no news of him, and the enemy fills all the valley behind us.' 

'I would that he had escaped,' said Thjoden. 'He was a mighty man. In 
him lived again the valour of Helm the Hammerhand. But we cannot await 
him 

here. We must draw all our forces now behind the walls. Are you well stored? 
We bring little provision, for we rode forth to open battle, not to a 
siege.' 

'Behind us in the caves of the Deep are three parts of the folk of 
Westfold, old and young, children and women,' said Gamling. 'But great store 
of food, and many beasts and their fodder, have also been gathered there.' 

'That is well,' said Jomer. 'They are burning or despoiling all that is 
left in the vale.' 

'If they come to bargain for our goods at Helm's Gate, they will pay a 
high price,' said Gamling. 

The king and his Riders passed on. Before the causeway that crossed the 
stream they dismounted. In a long file they led their horses up the ramp and 
passed within the gates of the Hornburg. There they were welcomed again with 
joy and renewed hope; for now there were men enough to man both the burg 
and 

the barrier wall. 

Quickly Jomer set his men in readiness. The king and the men of his 
household were in the Hornburg, and there also were many of the 
Westfold-men. But on the Deeping Wall and its tower, and behind it, Jomer 
arrayed most of the strength that he had, for here the defence seemed more 
doubtful, if the assault were determined and in great force. The horses were 




led far up the Deep under such guard as could be spared. 

The Deeping Wall was twenty feet high, and so thick that four men could 
walk abreast along the top, sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall 
man could look. Here and there were clefts in the stone through which men 
could shoot. This battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a 
door in the outer court of the Hornburg; three flights of steps led also up 
on to the wall from the Deep behind; but in front it was smooth, and the 
great stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found 
at their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff. 

Gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall. Legolas sat 
above on the parapet, fingering his bow, and peering out into the gloom. 

This is more to my liking,' said the dwarf, stamping on the stones. 

'Ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains. There is good rock here. 
This country has tough bones. I felt them in my feet as we came up from the 
dike. Give me a year and a hundred of my kin and I would make this a place 
that armies would break upon like water.’ 

’I do not doubt it,' said Legolas. 'But you are a dwarf, and dwarves 
are strange folk. I do not like this place, and I shall like it no more by 
the light of day. But you comfort me, Gimli, and I am glad to have you 
standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe. I wish there were more 
of your kin among us. But even more would I give for a hundred good archers 
of Mirkwood. We shall need them. The Rohirrim have good bowmen after 
their 

fashion, but there are too few here, too few.' 

'It is dark for archery,' said Gimli. 'Indeed it is time for sleep. 

Sleep! I feel the need of it, as never I thought any dwarf could. Riding is 
tiring work. Yet my axe is restless in my hand. Give me a row of ore-necks 
and room to swing and all weariness will fall from me!' 

A slow time passed. Far down in the valley scattered fires still 
burned. The hosts of Isengard were advancing in silence now. Their torches 
could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines. 

Suddenly from the Dike yells and screams, and the fierce battle-cries 
of men broke out. Flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered 
thickly at the breach. Then they scattered and vanished. Men came galloping 
back over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the Hornburg. The 
rearguard of the Westfolders had been driven in. 

'The enemy is at hand!' they said. 'We loosed every arrow that we had, 




and filled the Dike with Ores. But it will not halt them long. Already they 
are scaling the bank at many points, thick as marching ants. But we have 
taught them not to carry torches.' 

It was now past midnight. The sky was utterly dark, and the stillness 
of the heavy air foreboded storm. Suddenly the clouds were seared by a 
blinding flash. Branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills. For a 
staring moment the watchers on the walls saw all the space between them and 
the Dike lit with white light: it was boiling and crawling with black 
shapes, some squat and broad, some tall and grim, with high helms and sable 
shields. Hundreds and hundreds more were pouring over the Dike and through 
the breach. The dark tide flowed up to the walls from cliff to cliff. 

Thunder rolled in the valley. Rain came lashing down. 

Arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements, and fell 
clinking and glancing on the stones. Some found a mark. The assault on 
Helm's Deep had begun, but no sound or challenge was heard within; no 
answering arrows came. 

The assailing hosts halted, foiled by the silent menace of rock and 
wall. Ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness. Then the Ores 
screamed, waving spear and sword, and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that 
stood revealed upon the battlements; and the men of the Mark amazed looked 
out, as it seemed to them, upon a great field of dark corn, tossed by a 
tempest of war, and every ear glinted with barbed light. 

Brazen trumpets sounded. The enemy surged forward, some against the 
Deeping Wall, other towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the 
Hornburg-gates. There the hugest Ores were mustered, and the wild men of the 
Dunland fells. A moment they hesitated and then on they came. The lightning 
flashed, and blazoned upon every helm and shield the ghastly hand of 
Isengard was seen: They reached the summit of the rock; they drove towards 
the gates. 

Then at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them, and a hail of 
stones. They wavered, broke, and fled back; and then charged again, broke 
and charged again; and each time, like the incoming sea, they halted at a 
higher point. Again trumpets rang, and a press of roaring men leaped forth. 
They held their great shields above them like a roof, while in their midst 
they bore two trunks of mighty trees. Behind them ore-archers crowded, 
sending a hail of darts against the bowmen on the walls. They gained the 
gates. The trees, swung by strong arms, smote the timbers with a rending 




boom. If any man fell, crushed by a stone hurtling from above, two others 
sprang to take his place. Again and again the great rams swung and crashed. 

Jomer and Aragorn stood together on the Deeping Wall. They heard the 
roar of voices and the thudding of the rams; and then in a sudden flash of 
light they beheld the peril of the gates. 

'Come!' said Aragorn. 'This is the hour when we draw swords together!' 

Running like fire, they sped along the wall, and up the steps, and 
passed into the outer court upon the Rock. As they ran they gathered a 
handful of stout swordsmen. There was a small postern-door that opened in an 
angle of the burg- wall on the west, where the cliff stretched out to meet 
it. On that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate, between the 
wall and the sheer brink of the Rock. Together Jomer and Aragorn sprang 
through the door, their men close behind. The swords flashed from the sheath 
as one. 

'G®thwinl!' cried Jomer. 'G®thwinl for the Mark!' 

'And®ril!' cried Aragorn. 'And®ril for the D®nedain!' 

Charging from the side, they hurled themselves upon the wild men. 
And®ril rose and fell, gleaming with white fire. A shout went up from wall 
and tower: 'And®ril! And®ril goes to war. The Blade that was Broken shines 
again!' 

Dismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight; but the 
wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning-stroke, and they were 
swept away, hewn down, or cast over the Rock into the stony stream below. 
The ore-archers shot wildly and then fled. 

For a moment Jomer and Aragorn halted before the gates. The thunder was 
rumbling in the distance now. The lightning flickered still, far off among 
the mountains in the South. A keen wind was blowing from the North again. 
The clouds were torn and drifting, and stars peeped out; and above the hills 
of the Coomb-side the westering moon rode, glimmering yellow in the 
storm-wrack. 

'We did not come too soon,' said Aragorn, looking at the gates. Their 
great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent; many of their timbers 
were cracked. 

'Yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them,' said Jomer. 
'Look!' He pointed to the causeway. Already a great press of Ores and Men 
were gathering again beyond the stream. Arrows whined, and skipped on the 
stones about them. 'Come! We must get back and see what we can do to pile 




stone and beam across the gates within. Come now!' 

They turned and ran. At that moment some dozen Ores that had lain 
motionless among the slain leaped to their feet, and came silently and 
swiftly behind. Two flung themselves to the ground at Jomer's heels, tripped 
him, and in a moment they were on top of him. But a small dark figure that 
none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout: Baruk 
Khazvd! Khazvd ai-mknu! An axe swung and swept back. Two Ores fell 
headless. 

The rest fled. 

Jomer struggled to his feet, even as Aragorn ran back to his aid. 

The postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside 
with stones. When all were safe within, Jomer turned: ’I thank you, Gimli 
son of Gluin!' he said. ’I did not know that you were with us in the sortie. 

But oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. How came you there?’ 

’I followed you to shake off sleep,’ said Gimli; 'but I looked on the 
hillmen and they seemed over large for me, so I sat beside a stone to see 
your sword-play.’ 

’I shall not find it easy to repay you,’ said Jomer. 

’There may be many a chance ere the night is over,’ laughed the Dwarf. 

’But I am content. Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria.’ 

’Two!’ said Gimli, patting his axe. He had returned to his place on the 
wall. 

’Two?’ said Legolas. ’I have done better, though now I must grope for 
spent arrows; all mine are gone. Yet I make my tale twenty at the least. But 
that is only a few leaves in a forest.’ 

The sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining 
brightly. But the light brought little hope to the Riders of the Mark. The 
enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, still more 
were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the 
Rock gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. 
Against the Deeping Wall the hosts of Isengard roared like a sea. Ores and 
hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end. Ropes with grappling hooks 
were hurled over the parapet faster than men could cut them or fling them 
back. Hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. Many were cast down in ruin, 
but many more replaced them, and Ores sprang up them like apes in the dark 
forests of the South. Before the wall’s foot the dead and broken were piled 
like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the 




enemy came on. 

The men of Rohan grew weary. All their arrows were spent, and every 
shaft was shot; their swords were notched, and their shields were riven. 
Three times Aragorn and Jomer rallied them, and three times And®ril flamed 
in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall. 

Then a clamour arose in the Deep behind. Ores had crept like rats 
through the culvert through which the stream flowed out. There they had 
gathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above was hottest 
and nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the wall's top. Then 
they sprang out. Already some had passed into the jaws of the Deep and were 
among the horses, fighting with the guards. 

Down from the wall leapt Gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the 
cliffs. 'Khazvd! Khazvd!' He soon had work enough. 

'Ai-oi!' he shouted. 'The Ores are behind the wall. Ai-oi! Come, 
Legolas! There are enough for us both. Khazvd ai-mknu!' 

Gamling the Old looked down from the Hornburg, hearing the great voice 
of the dwarf above all the tumult. 'The Ores are in the Deep!' he cried. 
'Helm! Helm! Forth Helmingas. he shouted as he leaped down the stair from 
the Rock with many men of Westfold at his back. 

Their onset was fierce and sudden, and the Ores gave way before them. 
Ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain 
or driven shrieking into the chasm of the Deep to fall before the guardians 
of the hidden caves. 

'Twenty -one!' cried Gimli. He hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the 
last Ore before his feet. 'Now my count passes Master Legolas again.' 

'We must stop this rat-hole,' said Gamling. 'Dwarves are said to be 
cunning folk with stone. Lend us your aid, master!' 

'We do not shape stone with battle-axes, nor with our finger-nails,' 
said Gimli. 'But I will help as I may.' 

They gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find 
to hand, and under Gimli's direction the Westfold-men blocked up the inner 
end of the culvert, until only a narrow outlet remained. Then the 
Deeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and fretted in its choked path, 
and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff. 

'It will be drier above,' said Gimli. 'Come, Gamling, let us see how 
things go on the wall!' 

He climbed up and found Legolas beside Aragorn and Jomer. The elf was 




whetting his long knife. There was for a while a lull in the assault, since 
the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled. 

'Twenty-one!' said Gimli. 

'Good!' said Legolas. 'But my count is now two dozen. It has been 
knife- work up here.' 

Jomer and Aragorn leant wearily on their swords. Away on the left the 
crash and clamour of the battle on the Rock rose loud again. But the 
Hornburg still held fast, like an island in the sea. Its gates lay in ruin; 
but over the barricade of beams and stones within no enemy as yet had 
passed. 

Aragorn looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now sloping behind 
the western hills that enclosed the valley. 'This is a night as long as 
years,' he said. 'How long will the day tarry?' 

'Dawn is not far off,' said Gamling, who had now climbed up beside him. 
'But dawn will not help us, I fear.' 

'Yet dawn is ever the hope of men,' said Aragorn. 

'But these creatures of Isengard, these half-ores and goblin-men that 
the foul craft of Saruman has bred, they will not quail at the sun,' said 
Gamling. 'And neither will the wild men of the hills. Do you not hear their 
voices?' 

'I hear them,' said Jomer; 'but they are only the scream of birds and 
the bellowing of beasts to my ears.' 

'Yet there are many that cry in the Dunland tongue,' said Gamling. 'I 
know that tongue. It is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in 
many western valleys of the Mark. Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for 
our doom seems certain to them. 'The king the king!' they cry. 'We will take 
their king. Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads ! Death to the 
robbers of the North!' Such names they have for us. Not in half a thousand 
years have they forgotten their grievance that the lords of Gondor gave the 
Mark to Eorl the Young and made alliance with him. That old hatred Saruman 
has inflamed. They are fierce folk when roused. They will not give way now 
for dusk or dawn, until Thjoden is taken, or they themselves are slain.' 

'Nonetheless day will bring hope to me,' said Aragorn. 'Is it not said 
that no foe has ever taken the Hornburg, if men defended it?' 

'So the minstrels say,' said Jomer. 

'Then let us defend it, and hope!' said Aragorn. 

Even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets. Then there was a 




crash and a flash of flame and smoke. The waters of the Deeping-stream 
poured out hissing and foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping hole 
was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in. 

'Devilry of Saruman!' cried Aragorn. 'They have crept in the culvert 
again, while we talked, and they have lit the fire of Orthanc beneath our 
feet. Elendil, Elendil!' he shouted, as he leaped down into the breach; but 
even as he did so a hundred ladders were raised against the battlements. 
Over the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark 
wave upon a hill of sand. The defence was swept away. Some of the Riders 
were driven back, further and further into the Deep, falling and fighting as 
they gave way, step by step, towards the caves. Others cut their way back 
towards the citadel. 

A broad stairway, climbed from the Deep up to the Rock and the 
rear-gate of the Hornburg. Near the bottom stood Aragorn. In his hand still 
And®ril gleamed, and the terror of the sword for a while held back the 
enemy, as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the 
gate. Behind on the upper steps knelt Legolas. His bow was bent, but one 
gleaned arrow was all that he had left, and he peered out now, ready to 
shoot the first Ore that should dare to approach the stair. 

'All who can have now got safe within, Aragorn,' he called. 'Come 
back!' 

Aragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as he ran he stumbled in his 
weariness. At once his enemies leapt forward. Up came the Ores, yelling, 
with their long arms stretched out to seize him. The foremost fell with 
Legolas' last arrow in his throat, but the rest sprang over him. Then a 
great boulder, cast from the outer wall above, crashed down upon the stair, 
and hurled them back into the Deep. Aragorn gained the door, and swiftly it 
clanged to behind him. 

'Things go ill, my friends,' he said, wiping the sweat from his brow 
with his arm. 

'Ill enough,' said Legolas, 'but not yet hopeless, while we have you 
with us. Where is Gimli?' 

'I do not know.' said Aragorn. 'I last saw him fighting on the ground 
behind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.' 

'Alas! That is evil news,' said Legolas. 

'He is stout and strong,' said Aragorn. 'Let us hope that he will 
escape back to the caves. There he would be safe for a while. Safer than we. 




Such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.' 

That must be my hope" said Legolas. 'But I wish that he had come this 
way. I desired to tell Master Gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine.' 

'If he wins back to the caves, he will pass your count again,' laughed 
Aragorn. 'Never did I see an axe so wielded.' 

'I must go and seek some arrows,' said Legolas. 'Would that this night 
would end, and I could have better light for shooting.' 

Aragorn now passed into the citadel. There to his dismay he learned 
that Jomer had not reached the Hornburg. 

'Nay, he did not come to the Rock,' said one of the Westfold-men, 'I 
last saw him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the Deep. 
Gamling was with him, and the dwarf; but I could not come to them.' 

Aragorn strode on through the inner court, and mounted to a high 
chamber in the tower. There stood the king, dark against a narrow window, 
looking out upon the vale. 

'What is the news, Aragorn?' he said. 

'The Deeping Wall is taken, lord, and all the defence swept away; but 
many have escaped hither to the Rock.' 

'Is Jomer here?' 

'No, lord. But many of your men retreated into the Deep; and some say 
that Jomer was amongst them. In the narrows they may hold back the enemy 
and 

come within the caves. What hope they may have then I do not know.' 

'More than we. Good provision, it is said. And the air is wholesome 
there because of the outlets through fissures in the rock far above. None 
can force an entrance against determined men. They may hold out long.' 

'But the Ores have brought a devilry from Orthanc,' said Aragorn. 'They 
have a blasting fire, and with it they took the Wall. If they cannot come in 
the caves, they may seal up those that are inside. But now we must turn all 
our thoughts to our own defence.' 

'I fret in this prison,' said Thjoden. 'If I could have set a spear in 
rest, riding before my men upon the field, maybe I could have felt again the 
joy of battle, and so ended. But I serve little purpose here.' 

'Here at least you are guarded in the strongest fastness of the Mark,' 
said Aragorn. 'More hope we have to defend you in the Hornburg than in 
Edoras, or even at Dunharrow in the mountains.' 

'It is said that the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,' said 




Thjoden; 'but now my heart is doubtful. The world changes, and all that once 
was strong now proves unsure. How shall any tower withstand such numbers 
and 

such reckless hate? Had I known that the strength of Isengard was grown so 
great, maybe 1 should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it, for all 
the arts of Gandalf. His counsel seems not now so good as it did under the 
morning sun.' 

'Do not judge the counsel of Gandalf, until all is over, lord,' said 
Aragorn. 

'The end will not be long,' said the king. 'But I will not end here, 
taken like an old badger in a trap. Snowmane and Hasufel and the horses of 
my guard are in the inner court. When dawn comes, I will bid men sound 
Helm's horn, and I will ride forth. Will you ride with me then, son of 
Arathorn? Maybe we shall cleave a road, or make such an end as will be worth 
a song-if any be left to sing of us hereafter.' 

'I will ride with you,' said Aragorn. 

Taking his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their 
circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot. 
Legolas went with him. Blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the 
stones. Grappling -hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. Again and again the 
Ores gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them 
down. 

At last Aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts of 
the enemy. As he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale. Then he 
raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley. 

The Ores yelled and jeered. 'Come down! Come down!' they cried. 'If you 
wish to speak to us, come down! Bring out your king! We are the fighting 
Uruk-hai. We will fetch him from his hole, if he does not come. Bring out 
your skulking king!' 

'The king stays or comes at his own will,' said Aragorn. 

'Then what are you doing here?' they answered. 'Why do you look out? Do 
you wish to see the greatness of our army? We are the fighting Uruk-hai.' 

'I looked out to see the dawn,' said Aragorn. 

'What of the dawn?' they jeered. 'We are the Uruk-hai: we do not stop 
the fight for night or day, for fair weather or for storm. We come to kill, 
by sun or moon. What of the dawn?' 

'None knows what the new day shall bring him,' said Aragorn. 'Get you 




gone, ere it turn to your evil.' 

'Get down or we will shoot you from the wall,' they cried. 'This is no 
parley. You have nothing to say.' 

'I have still this to say,' answered Aragorn. 'No enemy has yet taken 
the Hornburg. Depart, or not one of you will be spared. Not one will be left 
alive to take back tidings to the North. You do not know your peril.' 

So great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragorn, as he stood there 
alone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, that many of 
the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and 
some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Ores laughed with loud voices; 
and a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall, as Aragorn leaped 
down. 

There was a roar and a blast of fire. The archway of the gate above 
which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and 
dust. 

The barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. Aragorn ran to the 
king's tower. 

But even as the gate fell, and the Ores about it yelled, preparing to 
charge, a murmur arose behind them, like a wind in the distance, and it grew 
to a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn. The Ores upon 
the Rock, hearing the rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back. And then, 
sudden and terrible, from the tower above, the sound of the great horn of 
Helm rang out. 

All that heard that sound trembled. Many of the Ores cast themselves on 
their faces and covered their ears with their claws. Back from the Deep the 
echoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald 
stood. But on the walls men looked up, listening with wonder; for the echoes 
did not die. Ever the horn-blasts wound on among the hills; nearer now and 
louder they answered one to another, blowing fierce and free. 

'Helm! Helm!' the Riders shouted. 'Helm is arisen and comes back to 
war. Helm for Thjoden King!' 

And with that shout the king came. His horse was white as snow, golden 
was his shield, and his spear was long. At his right hand was Aragorn, 
Elendil's heir, behind him rode the lords of the House of Eorl the Young. 
Light sprang in the sky. Night departed. 

'Forth Eorlingas!' With a cry and a great noise they charged. Down from 
the gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove through 




the hosts of Isengard as a wind among grass. Behind them from the Deep came 
the stern cries of men issuing from the caves, driving forth the enemy. Out 
poured all the men that were left upon the Rock. And ever the sound of 
blowing horns echoed in the hills. 

On they rode, the king and his companions. Captains and champions fell 
or fled before them. Neither ore nor man withstood them. Their backs were to 
the swords and spears of the Riders and their faces to the valley. They 
cried and wailed, for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the 
rising of the day. 

So King Thjoden rode from Helm's Gate and clove his path to the great 
Dike. There the company halted. Light grew bright about them. Shafts of the 
sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears. But they 
sat silent on their horses, and they gazed down upon the Deeping-coomb. 

The land had changed. Where before the green dale had lain, its grassy 
slopes lapping the ever-mounting hills, there now a forest loomed. Great 
trees, bare and silent, stood, rank on rank, with tangled bough and hoary 
head; their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass. Darkness was 
under them. Between the Dike and the eaves of that nameless wood only two 
open furlongs lay. There now cowered the proud hosts of Saruman, in terror 
of the king and in terror of the trees. They streamed down from Helm's Gate 
until all above the Dike was empty of them, but below it they were packed 
like swarming flies. Vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of 
the coomb, seeking to escape. Upon the east too sheer and stony was the 
valley's side; upon the left, from the west, their final doom approached. 

There suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in 
the rising sun. Over the low hills the horns were sounding. Behind him, 
hastening down the long slopes, were a thousand men on foot; their swords 
were in their hands. Amid them strode a man tall and strong. His shield was 
red. As he came to the valley's brink, he set to his lips a great black horn 
and blew a ringing blast. 

'Erkenbrand!' the Riders shouted. 'Erkenbrand!' 

'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn. 'Gandalf is come again!' 

'Mithrandir, Mithrandir!' said Legolas. 'This is wizardry indeed! Come! 

I would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.' 

The hosts of Isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from 
fear to fear. Again the horn sounded from the tower. Down through the breach 
of the Dike charged the king's company. Down from the hills leaped 




Erkenbrand, lord of Westfold. Down leaped Shadowfax, like a deer that runs 
surefooted in the mountains. The White Rider was upon them, and the terror 
of his coming filled the enemy with madness. The wild men fell on their 
faces before him. The Ores reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and 
spear. Like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. Wailing they 
passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever 
came again. 




Chapter 8 . The Road to Isengard 



So it was that in the light of a fair morning King Thjoden and Gandalf 
the White Rider met again upon the green grass beside the Deeping -stream. 
There was also Aragorn son of Arathorn, and Legolas the Elf, and Erkenbrand 
of Westfold, and the lords of the Golden Elouse. About them were gathered the 
Rohirrim, the Riders of the Mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and 
their eyes were turned towards the wood. 

Suddenly there was a great shout, and down from the Dike came those who 
had been driven back into the Deep. There came Gamling the Old, and Jomer 
son of Jomund, and beside them walked Gimli the dwarf. Ele had no helm, 
and 

about his head was a linen band stained with blood; but his voice was loud 
and strong. 

’Forty -two, Master Legolas!' he cried. 'Alas! My axe is notched: the 
forty-second had an iron collar on his neck. How is it with you?' 

'You have passed my score by one,' answered Legolas. 'But I do not 
grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs!' 

'Welcome, Jomer, sister-son!' said Thjoden. 'Now that I see you safe, I 
am glad indeed.' 

'Hail, Lord of the Mark!' said Jomer. 'The dark night has passed and 
day has come again. But the day has brought strange tidings.' He turned and 
gazed in wonder, first at the wood and then at Gandalf. 'Once more you come 
in the hour of need, unlooked-for,' he said. 

'Unlooked-for?' said Gandalf. 'I said that I would return and meet you 
here.' 

'But you did not name the hour, nor foretell the manner of your coming. 
Strange help you bring. You are mighty in wizardry, Gandalf the White!' 

'That may be. But if so, I have not shown it yet. I have but given good 
counsel in peril, and made use of the speed of Shadowfax. Your own valour 
has done more, and the stout legs of the Westfold-men marching through the 
night.' 

Then they all gazed at Gandalf with still greater wonder. Some glanced 
darkly at the wood, and passed their hands over their brows, as if they 
thought their eyes saw otherwise than his. 




Gandalf laughed long and merrily. The trees?' he said. 'Nay, I see the 
wood as plainly as do you. But that is no deed of mine. It is a thing beyond 
the counsel of the wise. Better than my design, and better even than my hope 
the event has proved.' 

'Then if not yours, whose is the wizardry?' said Thjoden. 'Not 
Saruman's, that is plain. Is there some mightier sage, of whom we have yet 
to learn?' 

'It is not wizardry, but a power far older,' said Gandalf: 'a power 
that walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang. 

Ere iron was found or tree was hewn, 

When young was mountain under moon; 

Ere ring was made, or wrought was woe, 

It walked the forests long ago. ' 

'And what may be the answer to your riddle?' said Thjoden. 

'If you would learn that, you should come with me to Isengard ' 
answered Gandalf. 

'To Isengard?' they cried. 

'Yes,' said Gandalf. 'I shall return to Isengard, and those who will 
may come with me. There we may see strange things.' 

'But there are not men enough in the Mark, not if they were all 
gathered together and healed of wounds and weariness, to assault the 
stronghold of Saruman,' said Thjoden. 

'Nevertheless to Isengard I go,' said Gandalf. 'I shall not stay there 
long. My way lies now eastward. Look for me in Edoras, ere the waning of the 
moon!' 

'Nay!' said Thjoden. 'In the dark hour before dawn I doubted, but we 
will not part now. I will come with you, if that is your counsel.' 

'I wish to speak with Saruman, as soon as may be now,' said Gandalf, 

'and since he has done you great injury, it would be fitting if you were 
there. But how soon and how swiftly will you ride?' 

'My men are weary with battle,' said the King; 'and I am weary also. 

For I have ridden far and slept little. Alas! My old age is not feigned nor 
due only to the whisperings of Wormtongue. It is an ill that no leech can 
wholly cure, not even Gandalf.' 

'Then let all who are to ride with me rest now,' said Gandalf. 'We will 
journey under the shadow of evening. It is as well; for it is my counsel 
that all our comings and goings should be as secret as may be, henceforth. 




But do not command many men to go with you, Thjoden. We go to a parley 
not 

to a fight.' 

The King then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses, and he 
sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the Mark; and 
they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste 
to Edoras. There the Lord of the Mark would hold an assembly of all that 
could bear arms, on the second day after the full moon. To ride with him to 
Isengard the King chose Jomer and twenty men of his household. With 
Gandalf 

would go Aragorn, and Legolas, and Gimli. In spite of his hurt the dwarf 
would not stay behind. 

'It was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it;' he said. 'It would 
take more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.' 

'I will tend it, while you rest,' said Aragorn. 

The king now returned to the Hornburg, and slept, such a sleep of quiet 
as he had not known for many years, and the remainder of his chosen company 
rested also. But the others, all that were not hurt or wounded, began a 
great labour; for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field 
or in the Deep. 

No Ores remained alive; their bodies were uncounted. But a great many 
of the hillmen had given themselves up; and they were afraid, and cried for 
mercy. 

The Men of the Mark took their weapons from them, and set them to work. 

'Help now to repair the evil in which you have joined,' said 
Erkenbrand; 'and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the 
Fords of Isen in arms, nor to march with the enemies of Men; and then you 
shall go free back to your land. For you have been deluded by Saruman. Many 
of you have got death as the reward of your trust in him; but had you 
conquered, little better would your wages have been.' 

The men of Dunland were amazed, for Saruman had told them that the men 
of Rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive. 

In the midst of the field before the Hornburg two mounds were raised, 
and beneath them were laid all the Riders of the Mark who fell in the 
defence, those of the East Dales upon one side, and those of Westfold upon 
the other. In a_ grave alone under the shadow of the Hornburg lay Hbma, 
captain of the King's guard. He fell before the Gate. 




The Ores were piled in great heaps, away from the mounds of Men, not 
far from the eaves of the forest. And the people were troubled in their 
minds; for the heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning. 

They had little wood for firing, and none would have dared to take an axe to 
the strange trees, even if Gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark 
nor bough at their great peril. 

'Let the Ores lie,' said Gandalf. ’The morning may bring new counsel.' 

In the afternoon the King's company prepared to depart. The work of 
burial was then but beginning; and Thjoden mourned for the loss of Hbma, his 
captain, and cast the first earth upon his grave. 'Great injury indeed has 
Saruman done to me and all this land,' he said; 'and I will remember it, 
when we meet.' 

The sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the Coomb, 
when at last Thjoden and Gandalf and their companions rode down from the 
Dike. Behind them were gathered a great host, both of the Riders and of the 
people of Westfold, old and young, women and children, who had come out 
from 

the caves. A song of victory they sang with clear voices; and then they fell 
silent, wondering what would chance, for their eyes were on the trees and 
they feared them. 

The Riders came to the wood, and they halted; horse and man, they were 
unwilling to pass in. The trees were grey and menacing, and a shadow or a 
mist was about them. The ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like 
searching fingers, their roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of 
strange monsters, and dark caverns opened beneath them. But Gandalf went 
forward, leading the company, and where the road from the Hornburg met the 
trees they saw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs; and 
through it Gandalf passed, and they followed him. Then to their amazement 
they found that the road ran on, and the Deeping-stream beside it; and the 
sky was open above and full of golden light. But on either side the great 
aisles of the wood were already wrapped in dusk, stretching away into 
impenetrable shadows; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of 
boughs, and far cries, and a rumour of wordless voices, murmuring angrily. 
No Ore or other living creature could be seen. 

Legolas and Gimli were now riding together upon one horse; and they 
kept close beside Gandalf, for Gimli was afraid of the wood. 

'It is hot in here,' said Legolas to Gandalf. 'I feel a great wrath 




about me. Do you not feel the air throb in your ears?' 

’Yes,' said Gandalf. 

’What has become of the miserable Ores?’ said Legolas. 

’That, I think, no one will ever know,’ said Gandalf. 

They rode in silence for a while; but Legolas was ever glancing from 
side to side, and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the 
wood, if Gimli had allowed it. 

’These are the strangest trees that ever I saw,’ he said; 'and I have 
seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age. I wish that there were 
leisure now to walk among them: they have voices, and in time I might come 
to understand their thought.’ 

’No, no!’ said Gimli. 'Let us leave them! I guess their thought 
already: hatred of all that go on two legs; and their speech is of crushing 
and strangling.’ 

’Not of all that go on two legs,’ said Legolas. 'There I think you are 
wrong. It is Ores that they hate. For they do not belong here and know 
little of Elves and Men. Far away are the valleys where they sprang. From 
the deep dales of Fangorn, Gimli, that is whence they come, I guess.’ 

’Then that is the most perilous wood in Middle-earth,’ said Gimli. ’I 
should be grateful for the part they have played, but I do not love them. 

You may think them wonderful, but I have seen a greater wonder in this land, 
more beautiful than any grove or glade that ever grew: my heart is still 
full of ft. 'Strange are the ways of Men, Legolas ! Here they have one of the 
marvels of the Northern World, and what do they say of it? Caves, they say! 
Caves! Holes to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in! My good Legolas, 
do you know that the caverns of Helm’s Deep are vast and beautiful? There 
would be an endless pilgrimage of Dwarves, merely to gaze at them, if such 
things were known to be. Aye indeed, they would pay pure gold for a brief 
glance!’ 

’And I would give gold to be excused,’ said Legolas; 'and double to be 
let out, if I strayed in!’ 

’You have not seen, so I forgive your jest,’ said Gimli. ’But you speak 
like a fool. Do you think those halls are fair, where your King dwells under 
the hill in Mirkwood, and Dwarves helped in their making long ago? They are 
but hovels compared with the caverns I have seen here: immeasurable halls, 
filled with an everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools, as fair 
as Kheled-zvram in the starlight. 




'And, Legolas, when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy 
floors under the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas, gems and crystals and 
veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows 
through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen 
Galadriel. There are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose, Legolas, 
fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms; they spring up from many-coloured 
floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains 
fine as frozen clouds; spears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! 

Still lakes mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered 
with clear glass; cities, such as the mind of Durin could scarce have 
imagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on 
into the dark recesses where no light can come. And plink! a silver drop 
falls, and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and 
waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. Then evening comes: they 
fade and twinkle out; the torches pass on into another chamber and another 
dream. There is chamber after chamber, Legolas; hall opening out of hall, 
dome after dome, stair beyond stair; and still the winding paths lead on 
into the mountains' heart. Caves! The Caverns of Helm's Deep! Happy was the 
chance that drove me there! It makes me weep to leave them.' 

'Then I will wish you this fortune for your comfort, Gimli,' said the 
Elf, 'that you may come safe from war and return to see them again. But do 
not tell all your kindred! There seems little left for them to do, from your 
account. Maybe the men of this land are wise to say little: one family of 
busy dwarves with hammer and chisel might mar more than they made.' 

'No, you do not understand,' said Gimli. 'No dwarf could be unmoved by 
such loveliness. None of Durin's race would mine those caves for stones or 
ore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there. Do you cut down groves of 
blossoming trees in the spring-time for firewood? We would tend these glades 
of flowering stone, not quarry them. With cautious skill, tap by tap — a 
small chip of rock and no more, perhaps, in a whole anxious day — so we 
could work, and as the years went by, we should open up new ways, and 
display far chambers that are still dark, glimpsed only as a void beyond 
fissures in the rock. And lights, Legolas! We should make lights, such lamps 
as once shone in Khazad-dym; and when we wished we would drive away 
the 

night that has lain there since the hills were made; and when we desired 
rest, we would let the night return.' 




'You move me, Gimli,' said Legolas. 'I have never heard you speak like 
this before. Almost you make me regret that I have not seen these caves. 
Come! Let us make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the perils that 
await us, we will journey for a while together. You shall visit Fangorn with 
me, and then I will come with you to see Helm's Deep.' 

'That would not be the way of return that I should choose,' said Gimli. 

'But I will endure Fangorn, if I have your promise to come back to the caves 
and share their wonder with me.' 

'You have my promise,' said Legolas. 'But alas! Now we must leave 
behind both cave and wood for a while: See! We are coming to the end of the 
trees. How far is it to Isengard, Gandalf?' 

'About fifteen leagues, as the crows of Saruman make it.' said Gandalf: 

'five from the mouth of Deeping-coomb to the Fords: and ten more from there 
to the gates of Isengard. But we shall not ride all the way this night.' 

'And when we come there, what shall we see?' asked Gimli. 'You may 
know, but I cannot guess.' 

'I do not know myself for certain,' answered the wizard. 'I was there 
at nightfall yesterday, but much may have happened since. Yet I think that 
you will not say that the journey was in vain — not though the Glittering 
Caves of Aglarond be left behind.' 

At last the company passed through the trees, and found that they had 
come to the bottom of the Coomb, where the road from Helm's Deep 
branched, 

going one way east to Edoras, and the other north to the Fords of Isen. As 
they rode from under the eaves of the wood, Legolas halted and looked back 
with regret. Then he gave a sudden cry. 

'There are eyes!' he said. 'Eyes looking out from the shadows of the 
boughs! I never saw such eyes before.' 

The others, surprised by his cry, halted and turned; but Legolas 
started to ride back. 

'No, no!' cried Gimli. 'Do as you please in your madness, but let me 
first get down from this horse! I wish to see no eyes!' 'Stay, Legolas 
Greenleaf!' said Gandalf. 'Do not go back into the wood, not yet! Now is not 
your time.' 

Even as he spoke, there came forward out of the trees three strange 
shapes. As tall as trolls they were, twelve feet or more in height; their 
strong bodies, stout as young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment or with 




hide of close-fitting grey and brown. Their limbs were long, and their hands 
had many fingers; their hair was stiff, and their beards grey-green as moss. 
They gazed out with solemn eyes, but they were not looking at the riders: 
their eyes were bent northwards. Suddenly they lifted their long hands to 
their mouths, and sent forth ringing calls, clear as notes of a horn, but 
more musical and various. The calls were answered; and turning again, the 
riders saw other creatures of the same kind approaching, striding through 
the grass. They came swiftly from the North, walking like wading herons in 
their gait, but not in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat 
quicker than the heron's wings. The riders cried aloud in wonder, and some 
set their hands upon their sword-hilts. 

'You need no weapons,' said Gandalf. 'These are but herdsmen. They are 
not enemies, indeed they are not concerned with us at all.' 

So it seemed to be; for as he spoke the tall creatures, without a 
glance at the riders, strode into the wood and vanished. 

'Herdsmen!' said Thjoden. 'Where are their flocks? What are they, 
Gandalf? For it is plain that to you, at any rate, they are not strange.' 

'They are the shepherds of the trees,' answered Gandalf. 'Is it so long 
since you listened to tales by the fireside? There are children in your land 
who, out of the twisted threads of story, could pick the answer to your 
question. You have seen Ents, O King, Ents out of Fangorn Forest, which in 
your tongue you call the Entwood. Did you think that the name was given only 
in idle fancy? Nay, Thjoden, it is otherwise: to them you are but the 
passing tale; all the years from Eorl the Young to Thjoden the Old are of 
little count to them; and all the deeds of your house but a small matter.' 

The king was silent. 'Ents!' he said at length. 'Out of the shadows of 
legend I begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees, I think. I 
have lived to see strange days. Long we have tended our beasts and our 
fields, built our houses, wrought our tools, or ridden away to help in the 
wars of Minas Tirith. And that we called the life of Men, the way of the 
world. We cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land. Songs we 
have that tell of these things, but we are forgetting them, teaching them 
only to children, as a careless custom. And now the songs have come down 
among us out of strange places, and walk visible under the Sun.' 

'You should be glad, Thjoden King,' said Gandalf. 'For not only the 
little life of Men is now endangered, but the life also of those things 
which you have deemed the matter of legend. You are not without allies, even 




if you know them not.' 

'Yet also I should be sad,' said Thjoden. ’For however the fortune of 
war shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall 
pass for ever out of Middle-earth?' 

'It may,' said Gandalf. 'The evil of Sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor 
made as if it had not been. But to such days we are doomed. Let us now go on 
with the journey we have begun!' 

The company turned then away from the Coomb and from the wood and 
took 

the road towards the Fords. Legolas followed reluctantly. The sun had set, 
already it had sunk behind the rim of the world; but as they rode out from 
the shadow of the hills and looked west to the Gap of Rohan the sky was 
still red, and a burning light was under the floating clouds. Dark against 
it there wheeled and flew many black -winged birds. Some passed overhead 
with 

mournful cries, returning to their homes among the rocks. 

'The carrion-fowl have been busy about the battle-field,' said Jomer. 

They rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plains about 
them. The slow moon mounted, now waxing towards the full, and in its cold 
silver light the swelling grass-lands rose and fell like a wide grey sea. 

They had ridden for some four hours from the branching of the roads when 
they drew near to the Fords. Long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river 
spread in stony shoals between high grassy terraces. Borne upon the wind 
they heard the howling of wolves. Their hearts were heavy, remembering the 
many men that had fallen in battle in this place. 

The road dipped between rising turf-banks, carving its way through the 
terraces to the river's edge, and up again upon the further side. There were 
three lines of flat stepping-stones across the stream, and between them 
fords for horses, that went from either brink to a bare eyot in the midst. 

The riders looked down upon the crossings, and it seemed strange to them; 
for the Fords had ever been a place full of the rush and chatter of water 
upon stones; but now they were silent. The beds of the stream were almost 
dry, a bare waste of shingles and grey sand. 

'This is become a dreary place,' said Jomer. 'What sickness has 
befallen the river? Many fair things Saruman has destroyed: has he devoured 
the springs of Isen too?' 'So it would seem,' said Gandalf. 

'Alas!' said Thjoden. 'Must we pass this way, where the carrion-beasts 




devour so many good Riders of the Mark?' 

This is our way,' said Gandalf. 'Grievous is the fall of your men; but 
you shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them. 

It is with their friends, the Ores, that they hold their feast: such indeed 
is the friendship of their kind. Come!’ 

They rode down to the river, and as they came the wolves ceased their 
howling and slunk away. Fear fell on them seeing Gandalf in the moon, and 
Shadowfax his horse shining like silver. The riders passed over to the 
islet, and glittering eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks. 

'Look!' said Gandalf. 'Friends have laboured here.’ 

And they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled, ringed 
with stones, and set about with many spears. 

’Here lie all the Men of the Mark that fell near this place,’ said 
Gandalf. 

'Here let them rest!' said Jomer. 'And when their spears have rotted 
and rusted, long still may their mound stand and guard the Fords of Isen!' 

'Is this your work also, Gandalf, my friend?' said Thjoden. 'You 
accomplished much in an evening and a night!' 

'With the help of Shadowfax — and others,' said Gandalf. 'I rode fast 
and far. But here beside the mound I will say this for your comfort: many 
fell in the battles of the Fords, but fewer than rumour made them. More were 
scattered than were slain; I gathered together all that I could find. Some 
men I sent with Grimbold of Westfold to join Erkenbrand. Some I set to make 
this burial. They have now followed your marshal, Elfhelm. I sent him with 
many Riders to Edoras. Saruman I knew had despatched his full strength 
against you, and his servants had turned aside from all other errands and 
gone to Helm's Deep: the lands seemed empty of enemies; yet I feared that 
wolf-riders and plunderers might ride nonetheless to Meduseld, while it was 
undefended. But now I think you need not fear: you will find your house to 
welcome your return.' 

'And glad shall I be to see it again,' said Thjoden, 'though brief now, 

I doubt not, shall be my abiding there.' 

With that the company said farewell to the island and the mound, and 
passed over the river, and climbed the further bank. Then they rode on, glad 
to have left the mournful Fords. As they went the howling of the wolves 
broke out anew. 

There was an ancient highway that ran down from Isengard to the 




crossings. For some way it took its course beside the river, bending with it 
east and then north; but at the last it turned away and went straight 
towards the gates of Isengard; and these were under the mountain-side in the 
west of the valley, sixteen miles or more from its mouth. This road they 
followed but they did not ride upon it; for the ground beside it was firm 
and level, covered for many miles about with short springing turf. They rode 
now more swiftly, and by midnight the Fords were nearly five leagues behind. 
Then they halted, ending their night's journey, for the King was weary. They 
were come to the feet of the Misty Mountains, and the long arms of Nan 
Curunnr stretched down to meet them. Dark lay the vale before them, for the 
moon had passed into the West, and its light was hidden by the hills. But 
out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as 
it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimmering 
billows, black and silver, over the starry sky. 

’What do you think of that, Gandalf?' asked Aragorn. 'One would say 
that all the Wizard's Vale was burning.' 

'There is ever a fume above that valley in these days,' said Jomer: 

'but I have never seen aught like this before. These are steams rather than 
smokes. Saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us. Maybe he is boiling all 
the waters of Isen, and that is why the river runs dry.' 

'Maybe he is,' said Gandalf. 'Tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing. 
Now let us rest for a while, if we can.' 

They camped beside the bed of the Isen river; it was still silent and 
empty. Some of them slept a little. But late in the night the watchmen cried 
out, and all awoke. The moon was gone. Stars were shining above; but over 
the ground there crept a darkness blacker than the night. On both sides of 
the river it rolled towards them, going northward. 

'Stay where you are!' said Gandalf. 'Draw no weapons! Wait! and it will 
pass you by!' 

A mist gathered about them. Above them a few stars still glimmered 
faintly; but on either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom; they 
were in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow. Voices they heard, 
whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling sigh; the earth shook 
under them. Long it seemed to them that they sat and were afraid; but at 
last the darkness and the rumour passed, and vanished between the mountain's 
arms. 

Away south upon the Hornburg, in the middle night men heard a great 




noise, as a wind in the valley, and the ground trembled; and all were afraid 
and no one ventured to go forth. But in the morning they went out and were 
amazed; for the slain Ores were gone, and the trees also. Far down into the 
valley of the Deep the grass was crushed and trampled brown, as if giant 
herdsmen had pastured great droves of cattle there; but a mile below the 
Dike a huge pit had been delved in the earth, and over it stones were piled 
into a hill. Men believed that the Ores whom they had slain were buried 
there; but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them, none 
could say, for no man ever set foot upon that hill. The Death Down it was 
afterwards called, and no grass would grow there. But the strange trees were 
never seen in Deeping-coomb again; they had returned at night, and had gone 
far away to the dark dales of Fangorn. Thus they were revenged upon the 
Ores. 

The king and his company slept no more that night; but they saw and 
heard no other strange thing, save one: the voice of the river beside them 
suddenly awoke. There was a rush of water hurrying down among the stones; 
and when it had passed, the Isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again, as it 
had ever done. 

At dawn they made ready to go on. The light came grey and pale, and 
they did not see the rising of the sun. The air above was heavy with fog, 
and a reek lay on the land about them. They went slowly, riding now upon the 
highway. It was broad and hard, and well-tended. Dimly through the mists 
they could descry the long arm of the mountains rising on their left. They 
had passed into Nan Curunnr, the Wizard's Vale. That was a sheltered valley, 
open only to the South. Once it had been fair and green, and through it the 
Isen flowed, already deep and strong before it found the plains; for it was 
fed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain-washed hills, and all 
about it there had lain a pleasant, fertile land. 

It was not so now. Beneath the walls of Isengard there still were acres 
tilled by the slaves of Saruman; but most of the valley had become a 
wilderness of weeds and thorns. Brambles trailed upon the ground, or 
clambering over bush and bank, made shaggy caves where small beasts 
housed. 

No trees grew there; but among the rank grasses could still be seen the 
burned and axe-hewn stumps of ancient groves. It was a sad country, silent 
now but for the stony noise of quick waters. Smokes and steams drifted in 
sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows. The riders did not speak. Many 




doubted in their hearts, wondering to what dismal end their journey led. 

After they had ridden for some miles, the highway became a wide street, 
paved with great flat stones, squared and laid with skill; no blade of grass 
was seen in any joint. Deep gutters, filled with trickling water, ran down 
on either side. Suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them. It was black; 
and set upon it was a great stone, carved and painted in the likeness of a 
long White Hand. Its finger pointed north. Not far now they knew that the 
gates of Isengard must stand, and their hearts were heavy; but their eyes 
could not pierce the mists ahead. 

Beneath the mountain's arm within the Wizard's Vale through years 
uncounted had stood that ancient place that Men called Isengard. Partly it 
was shaped in the making of the mountains, but mighty works the Men of 
Westernesse had wrought there of old; and Saruman had dwelt there long and 
had not been idle. 

This was its fashion, while Saruman was at his height, accounted by 
many the chief of Wizards. A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, 
stood out from the shelter of the mountain- side, from which it ran and then 
returned again. One entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved 
in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been 
hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought 
and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living 
stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the 
arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing 
tunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast 
shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and 
filled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams that 
flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there in the 
latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags, dark and 
hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched long lines of 
pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron, joined by heavy chains. 

Many houses there were, chambers, halls, and passages, cut and 
tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side, so that all the open 
circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors. Thousands could 
dwell there, workers, servants, slaves, and warriors with great store of 
arms; wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath. The plain, too, was 
bored and delved. Shafts were driven deep into the ground; their upper ends 
were covered by low mounds and domes of stone, so that in the moonlight the 




Ring of Isengard looked like a graveyard of unquiet dead. For the ground 
trembled. The shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns 
far under; there Saruman had treasuries, store-houses, armouries, smithies, 
and great furnaces. Iron wheels revolved there endlessly, and hammers 
thudded. At night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents, lit from beneath 
with red light, or blue, or venomous green. 

To the centre all the roads ran between their chains. There stood a 
tower of marvellous shape. It was fashioned by the builders of old, who 
smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a thing not made by the 
craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment 
of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it was. black and gleaming hard: four 
mighty piers of many-sided stone were welded into one, but near the summit 
they opened into gaping horns, their pinnacles sharp as the points of 
spears, keen-edged as knives. Between them was a narrow space, and there 
upon a floor of polished stone, written with strange signs, a man might 
stand five hundred feet above the plain. This was Orthanc, the citadel of 
Saruman, the name of which had (by design or chance) a twofold meaning; for 
in the Elvish speech orthanc signifies Mount Fang, but in the language of 
the Mark of old the Cunning Mind. 

A strong place and wonderful was Isengard, and long it had been 
beautiful; and there great lords had dwelt, the wardens of Gondor upon the 
West, and wise men that watched the stars. But Saruman had slowly shaped it 
to his shifting purposes, and made it better, as he thought, being 
deceived-for all those arts and subtle devices, for which he forsook his 
former wisdom, and which fondly he imagined were his own. came but 
from 

Mordor; so that what he made was naught, only a little copy, a child's model 
or a slave's flattery, of that vast fortress, armoury, prison, furnace of 
great power, Barad-dyr, the Dark Tower, which suffered no rival, and laughed 
at flattery, biding its time, secure in its pride and its immeasurable 
strength. 

This was the stronghold of Saruman, as fame reported it; for within 
living memory the men of Rohan had not passed its gates, save perhaps a few, 
such as Wormtongue, who came in secret and told no man what they saw. 

Now Gandalf rode to the great pillar of the Hand, and passed it: and as 
he did so the Riders saw to their wonder that the Hand appeared no longer 
white. It was stained as with dried blood; and looking closer they perceived 




that its nails were red. Unheeding Gandalf rode on into the mist, and 
reluctantly they followed him. All about them now, as if there had been a 
sudden flood, wide pools of water lay beside the road, filling the hollows, 
and rills went trickling down among the stones. 

At last Gandalf halted and beckoned to them; and they came, and saw 
that beyond him the mists had cleared, and a pale sunlight shone. The hour 
of noon had passed. They were come to the doors of Isengard. 

But the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground. And all about, 
stone, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, was scattered 
far and wide, or piled in ruinous heaps. The great arch still stood, but it 
opened now upon a roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare, and through the 
cliff-like walls on either side great rents and breaches had been torn; 
their towers were beaten into dust. If the Great Sea had risen in wrath and 
fallen on the hills with storm, it could have worked no greater ruin. 

The ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron, in 
which there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and spars, chests and 
casks and broken gear. Twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintered 
stems above the flood, but all the roads were drowned. Far off, it seemed, 
half veiled in winding cloud, there loomed the island rock. Still dark and 
tall, unbroken by the storm, the tower of Orthanc stood. Pale waters lapped 
about its feet. 

The king and all his company sat silent on their horses, marvelling, 
perceiving that the power of Saruman was overthrown; but how they could not 
guess. And now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined 
gates. There they saw close beside them a great rubble-heap; and suddenly 
they were aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease, grey-clad, 
hardly to be seen among the stones. There were bottles and bowls and 
platters laid beside them, as if they had just eaten well, and now rested 
from their labour. One seemed asleep; the other, with crossed legs and arms 
behind his head, leaned back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth 
long wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke. 

For a moment Thjoden and Jomer and all his men stared at them in 
wonder. Amid all the wreck of Isengard this seemed to them the strangest 
sight. But before the king could speak, the small smoke-breathing figure 
became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent on the edge of the 
mist. He sprang to his feet. A young man he looked, or like one, though not 
much more than half a man in height; his head of brown curling hair was 




uncovered, but he was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and 
shape as the companions of Gandalf had worn when they rode to Edoras. He 
bowed very low. putting his hand upon his breast. Then, seeming not to 
observe the wizard and his friends, he turned to Jomer and the king. 

'Welcome, my lords, to Isengard!' he said. 'We are the doorwardens. 
Meriadoc, son of Saradoc is my name; and my companion, who, alas! is 
overcome with weariness' — here he gave the other a dig with his foot — 

'is Peregrin, son of Paladin, of the house of Took. Far in the North is our 
home. The Lord Saruman is within; but at the moment he is closeted with one 
Wormtongue, or doubtless he would be here to welcome such honourable 
guests.' 

'Doubtless he would!' laughed Gandalf. 'And was it Saruman that ordered 
you to guard his damaged doors, and watch for the arrival of guests, when 
your attention could be spared from plate and bottle?' 

'No, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered Merry gravely 'He has 
been much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who has taken over 
the 

management of Isengard. He commanded me to welcome the Lord of Rohan 
with 

fitting words. I have done my best.' 

'And what about your companions? What about Legolas and me?' cried 
Gimli, unable to contain himself longer. 'You rascals, you woolly-footed and 
wool-pated truants ! A fine hunt you have led us! Two hundred leagues, 
through fen and forest, battle and death, to rescue you ! And here we find 
you feasting and idling -and smoking ! Smoking! Where did you come by the 
weed, you villains? Hammer and tongs! I am so torn between rage and joy, 
that if I do not burst, it will be a marvel!' 

'You speak for me, Gimli,' laughed Legolas. 'Though I would sooner 
learn how they came by the wine.' 

'One thing you have not found in your hunting, and that's brighter 
wits,' said Pippin, opening an eye. 'Here you find us sitting on a field of 
victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few 
well-earned comforts!' 

'Well-earned?' said Gimli. 'I cannot believe that!' 

The Riders laughed. 'It cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting 
of dear friends,' said Thjoden. 'So these are the lost ones of your company, 
Gandalf? The days are fated to be filled with marvels. Already I have seen 




many since I left my house; and now here before my eyes stand yet another of 
the folk of legend. Are not these the Halflings, that some among us call the 
Holbytlan?' 

'Hobbits, if you please, lord,' said Pippin. 

'Hobbits?' said Thjoden. 'Your tongue is strangely changed; but the 
name sounds not unfitting so. Hobbits! No report that I have heard does 
justice to the truth.' 

Merry bowed; and Pippin got up and bowed low. 'You are gracious, lord; 
or I hope that I may so take your words,' he said. 'And here is another 
marvel! I have wandered in many lands, since I left my home, and never till 
now have I found people that knew any story concerning hobbits.' 

'My people came out of the North long ago,' said Thjoden. 'But I will 
not deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits. All that is said among us 
is that far away, over many hills and rivers, live the halfling folk that 
dwell in holes in sand-dunes. But there are no legends of their deeds, for 
it is said that they do little, and avoid the sight of men, being able to 
vanish in a twinkling: and they can change their voices to resemble the 
piping of birds. But it seems that more could be said.' 

'It could indeed, lord,' said Merry. 

'For one thing,' said Thjoden, 'I had not heard that they spouted smoke 
from their mouths.' 

'That is not surprising,' answered Merry; 'for it is an art which we 
have not practised for more than a few generations. It was Tobold 
Hornblower, of Longbottom in the Southfarthing, who first grew the true 
pipe-weed in his gardens, about the year 1070 according to our reckoning. 
How old Toby came by the plant...' 

'You do not know your danger, Thjoden,' interrupted Gandalf. 'These 
hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table, 
or the small doings of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, 
and remoter cousins to the ninth degree, if you encourage them with undue 
patience. Some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking. 
Where is Treebeard, Merry?' 

'Away on the north side, I believe. He went to get a drink-of clean 
water. Most of the other Ents are with him, still busy at their work — over 
there.' Merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake; and as they looked, 
they heard a distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was falling 
from the mountain-side. Far away came a hoom-hom, as of horns blowing 




triumphantly. 

'And is Orthanc then left unguarded?' asked Gandalf. 

'There is the water,' said Merry. 'But Quickbeam and some others are 
watching it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of Saruman's 
planting. Quickbeam, I think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair.' 

'Yes, a tall grey Ent is there,' said Legolas, 'but his arms are at his 
sides, and he stands as still as a door -tree.' 

'It is past noon,' said Gandalf, 'and we at any rate have not eaten 
since early morning. Yet I wish to see Treebeard as soon as may be. Did he 
leave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?' 

'He left a message,' said Merry, 'and I was coming to it, but I have 
been hindered by many other questions. I was to say that, if the Lord of the 
Mark and Gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find Treebeard 
there, and he will welcome them. I may add that they will also find food of 
the best there, it was discovered and selected by your humble servants.' He 
bowed. 

Gandalf laughed. 'That is better!' he said. 'Well, Thjoden. will you 
ride with me to find Treebeard? We must go round about, but it is not far. 
When you see Treebeard, you will learn much. For Treebeard is Fangorn, and 
the eldest and chief of the Ents, and when you speak with him you will hear 
the speech of the oldest of all living things.' 

'I will come with you,' said Thjoden. 'Farewell, my hobbits! May we 
meet again in my house ! There you shall sit beside me and tell me all that 
your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires, as far as you can reckon 
them; and we will speak also of Tobold the Old and his herb-lore. Farewell!' 

The hobbits bowed low. 'So that is the King of Rohan!' said Pippin in 
an undertone. 'A fine old fellow. Very polite.' 




Chapter 9 . Flotsam and Jetsam 



Gandalf and the King’s company rode away, turning eastward to make the 
circuit of the ruined walls of Isengard. But Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas 
remained behind. Leaving Arod and Hasufel to stray in search of grass, they 
came and sat beside the hobbits. 

'Well, well! The hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of 
us ever thought to come,' said Aragorn. 

'And now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,' said 
Legolas, 'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small 
riddles. We tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many 
things that I should like to know the truth of.' 

'And there is a great deal, too, that we want to know about you ' said 
Merry. 'We have learnt a few things through Treebeard, the Old Ent, but that 
is not nearly enough.' 

'All in good time,' said Legolas. 'We were the hunters, and you should 
give an account of yourselves to us first.' 

'Or second,' said Gimli. 'It would go better after a meal, t have a 
sore head; and it is past mid-day. You truants might make amends by finding 
us some of the plunder that you spoke of. Food and drink would pay off some 
of my score against you.' 

'Then you shall have it,' said Pippin. 'Will you have it here, or in 
more comfort in what's left of Saruman's guard-house— over there under the 
arch? We had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road.' 

'Less than an eye!' said Gimli. 'But I will not go into any ore-house 
nor touch Ores' meat or anything that they have mauled.' 

'We wouldn't ask you to,' said Merry. 'We have had enough of Ores 
ourselves to last a life-time. But there were many other folk in Isengard. 
Saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his Ores. He had Men to guard his 
gates: some of his most faithful servants, I suppose. Anyway they were 
favoured and got good provisions.' 

'And pipe-weed?' asked Gimli. 

'No, I don't think so,' Merry laughed. 'But that is another story, 
which can wait until after lunch.' 

'Well let us go and have lunch then!' said the Dwarf. 




The hobbits led the way; and they passed under the arch and came to a 
wide door upon the left, at the top of a stair. It opened direct into a 
large chamber, with other smaller doors at the far end, and a hearth and 
chimney at one side. The chamber was hewn out of the stone; and it must once 
have been dark, for its windows looked out only into the tunnel. But light 
came in now through the broken roof. On the hearth wood was burning. 

'I lit a bit of fire,' said Pippin. 'It cheered us up in the fogs. 

There were few faggots about, and most of the wood we could find was wet. 
But there is a great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up 
through the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked. A fire is handy. 

I will make you some toast. The bread is three or four days old, I am 
afraid.' 

Aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long 
table, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors. 
’Store-room in there, and above the woods, luckily,’ said Pippin, as they 
came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of various sorts. 

’And you need not turn up your nose at the provender, Master Gimli,’ 
said Merry. 'This is not ore-stuff, but man-food, as Treebeard calls it. 

Will you have wine or beer? There’s a barrel inside there — very passable. 

And this is first-rate salted pork. Or I can cut you some rashers of bacon 
and broil them, if you like. I am sorry there is no green stuff: the 
deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days! I cannot offer 
you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread. Are you 
content?’ 

’Indeed yes,’ said Gimli. ’The score is much reduced.’ 

The three were soon busy with their meal; and the two hobbits, 
unabashed, set to a second time. ’We must keep our guests company,’ they 
said. 

’You are full of courtesy this morning,’ laughed Legolas. ’But maybe, 
if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another 
company again.’ 

’Maybe; and why not?’ said Pippin. ’We had foul fare with the Ores, and 
little enough for days before that. It seems a long while since we could eat 
to heart’s content.’ 

’It does not seem to have done you any harm,’ said Aragorn. 'Indeed you 
look in the bloom of health.’ 

’Aye, you do indeed,’ said Gimli, looking them up and down over the top 




of his cup. ’Why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; 
and I would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for 
hobbits of your age. This Treebeard at any rate has not starved you.' 

'He has not,' said Merry. 'But Ents only drink, and drink is not enough 
for content. Treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need 
of something solid. And even lembas is none the worse for a change.' 

'You have drunk of the waters of the Ents, have you?' said Legolas. 

'Ah, then I think it is likely that Gimli's eyes do not deceive him. Strange 
songs have been sung of the draughts of Fangorn.' 

'Many strange tales have been told about that land,' said Aragorn. 'I 
have never entered it. Come, tell me more about it, and about the Ents!' 

'Ents,' said Pippin, 'Ents are — well Ents are all different for on 
thing. But their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' He tried a few fumbling 
words that trailed off into silence. 'Oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen 
some at a distance, already -they saw you at any rate, and reported that you 
were on the way-and you will see many others, I expect, before you leave 
here. You must form your own ideas.' 

'Now, now!' said Gimli. 'We are beginning the story in the middle. I 
should like a tale in the right order, starting with that strange day when 
our fellowship was broken.' 

'You shall have it, if there is time,' said Merry. 'But first-if you 
have finished eating-you shall fill your pipes and light up. And then for a 
little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at Bree again, or in 
Rivendell.' 

He produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. 'We have heaps of it,' 
he said; 'and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. We did some 
salvage-work this morning, Pippin and I. There are lots of things floating 
about. It was Pippin who found two small barrels, washed up out of some 
cellar or store-house, I suppose. When we opened them, we found they were 
filled with this: as fine a pipe- weed as you could wish for, and quite 
unspoilt.' 

Gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it. 'It feels 
good, and it smells good,' he said. 

'It is good!' said Merry. 'My dear Gimli, it is Longbottom Leaf! There 
were the Hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as plain as plain. How it 
came here, I can't imagine. For Saruman's private use. I fancy. I never knew 
that it went so far abroad. But it comes in handy now?' 




'It would,' said Gimli, 'if I had a pipe to go with it. Alas, I lost 
mine in Moria, or before. Is there no pipe in all your plunder?' 

'No, I am afraid not,' said Merry. 'We have not found any, not even 
here in the guardrooms. Saruman kept this dainty to himself, it seems. And I 
don't think it would be any use knocking on the doors of Orthanc to beg a 
pipe of him! We shall have to share pipes, as good friends must at a pinch.' 

'Half a moment!' said Pippin. Putting his hand inside the breast of his 
jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string. 'I keep a treasure or 
two near my skin, as precious as Rings to me. Here's one: my old wooden 
pipe. And here's another: an unused one. I have carried it a long way,, 
though I don't know why. I never really expected to find any pipe- weed on 
the journey, when my own ran out. But now it comes in useful after all.' He 
held up a small pipe with a wide flattened bowl, and handed it to Gimli. 
'Does that settle the score between us?' he said. 'Settle it!' cried Gimli. 

'Most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.' 

'Well, I am going back into the open air, to see what the wind and sky 
are doing!' said Legolas. 

'We will come with you,' said Aragorn. 

They went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the 
gateway. They could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting 
and floating away upon the breeze. 

'Now let us take our ease here for a little!' said Aragorn. 'We will 
sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as Gandalf says, while he is busy 
elsewhere. I feel a weariness such as I have seldom felt before.' He wrapped 
his grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long 
legs. Then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke. 

'Look!' said Pippin. 'Strider the Ranger has come back!' 

'He has never been away,' said Aragorn. 'I am Strider and D®nadan too, 
and I belong both to Gondor and the North.' 

They smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them; slanting 
into the valley from among white clouds high in the West. Legolas lay still, 
looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes, and singing softly to 
himself. At last he sat up. 'Come now!' he said. 'Time wears on, and the 
mists are blowing away, or would if you strange folk did not wreathe 
yourselves in smoke. What of the tale?' 

'Well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all 
strung-up in an ore-camp,' said Pippin. 'Let me see, what is today?' 




'The fifth of March in the Shire-reckoning,' said Aragorn. Pippin made 
some calculations on his fingers. 'Only nine days ago!' he said.l 'It seems 
a year since we were caught. Well, though half of it was like a bad dream, I 
reckon that three very horrible days followed. Merry will correct me, if I 
forget anything important: I am not going into details: the whips and the 
filth and stench and all that; it does not bear remembering.' With that he 
plunged into an account of Boromir's last fight and the ore-march from Emyn 
Muil to the Forest. The others nodded as the various points were fitted in 
with their guesses. 

'Here are some treasures that you let fall,' said Aragorn. 'You will be 
glad to have them back.' He loosened his belt from under his cloak and took 
from it the two sheathed knives. 

'Well!' said Merry. 'I never expected to see those again! I marked a 
few ores with mine; but Ugl®k took them from us. How he glared! At first I 
thought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things away as if they 
burned him.' 

'And here also is your brooch, Pippin,' said Aragorn. 'I have kept it 
safe, for it is a very precious thing.' 

'I know,' said Pippin. 'It was a wrench to let it go; but what else 
could I do?' 

'Nothing else,' answered Aragorn. 'One who cannot cast away a treasure 
at need is in fetters. You did rightly.' 

'The cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!' said 
Gimli. 'Luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, 
one might say.' 

'And set us a pretty riddle,' said Legolas. 'I wondered if you had 
grown wings!' 

'Unfortunately not,' said Pippin. 'But you did not know about 
Grishnbkh.' He shuddered and said no more, leaving Merry to tell of those 
last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful 
strength of Grishnbkh's hairy arms. 

'All this about the Ores of Barad-dyr, Lugb®rz as they call it, makes 
me uneasy,' said Aragorn. 'The Dark Lord already knew too much and his 
servants also; and Grishnbkh evidently sent some message across the River 
after the quarrel. The Red Eye will be looking towards Isengard. But Saruman 
at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.' 

'Yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,' said Merry. 'Things 




began to go all wrong for him from the moment his Ores set foot in Rohan.' 

'We caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so Gandalf hints,' said 
Gimli. 'On the edge of the Forest.' 

'When was that?' asked Pippin. 

'Five nights ago,' said Aragorn. 

'Let me see,' said Merry: 'five nights ago-now we come to a part of the 
story you know nothing about. We met Treebeard that morning after the 
battle; and that night we were at Wellinghall, one of his ent-houses. The 
next morning we went to Entmoot, a gathering of Ents, that is, and the 
queerest thing I have ever seen in my life. It lasted all that day and the 
next; and we spent the nights with an Ent called Quickbeam. And then late in 
the afternoon in the third day of their moot, the Ents suddenly blew up. It 
was amazing. The Forest had felt as tense as if a thunderstorm was brewing 
inside it: then all at once it exploded. I wish you could have heard their 
song as they marched.' 

'If Saruman had heard it, he would be a hundred miles away by now, even 
if he had had to run on his own legs,' said Pippin. 

'Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone, 

We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door! 

There was very much more. A great deal of the song had no words, and 
was like a music of horns and drums. It was very exciting. But I thought it 
was only marching music and no more, just a song — until I got here. I know 
better now.' 

'We came down over the last ridge into Nan Curunnr, after night had 
fallen,' Merry continued. 'It was then that I first had the feeling that the 
Forest itself was moving behind us. I thought I was dreaming an entish 
dream, but Pippin had noticed it too. We were both frightened; but we did 
not find out more about it until later. 

'It was the Huorns, or so the Ents call them in "short language". 
Treebeard won't say much about them, but I think they are Ents that have 
become almost like trees, at least to look at. They stand here and there in 
the wood or under its eaves, silent, watching endlessly over the trees; but 
deep in the darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them, I 
believe. 

'There is a great power in them, and they seem able to wrap themselves 
in shadow: it is difficult to see them moving. But they do. They can move 
very quickly, if they are angry. You stand still looking at the weather, 




maybe, or listening to the rustling of the wind, and then suddenly you find 
that you are in the middle of a wood with great groping trees all around 
you. They still have voices, and can speak with the Ents — that is why they 
are called Huorns, Treebeard says — but they have become queer and wild. 
Dangerous. I should be terrified of meeting them, if there were no true Ents 
about to look after them. 

'Well, in the early night we crept down a long ravine into the upper 
end of the Wizard's Vale, the Ents with all their rustling Huorns behind. We 
could not see them, of course, but the whole air was full of creaking. It 
was very dark, a cloudy night. They moved at a great speed as soon as they 
had left the hills, and made a noise like a rushing wind. The Moon did not 
appear through the clouds, and not long after midnight there was a tall wood 
all round the north side of Isengard. There was no sign of enemies nor of 
any challenge. There was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower, 
that was all. 

'Treebeard and a few more Ents crept on, right round to within sight of 
the great gates. Pippin and I were with him. We were sitting on Treebeard's 
shoulders, and I could feel the quivering tenseness in him. But even when 
they are roused, Ents can be very cautious and patient. They stood still as 
carved stones, breathing and listening. 

'Then all at once there was a tremendous stir. Trumpets blared and the 
walls of Isengard echoed. We thought that we had been discovered, and that 
battle was going to begin. But nothing of the sort. All Saruman's people 
were marching away. I don't know much about this war, or about the 
Horsemen 

of Rohan, but Saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his 
men with one final blow. He emptied Isengard. I saw the enemy go: endless 
lines of marching Ores; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. And 
there were battalions of Men, too. Many of them carried torches, and in the 
flare I could see their faces. Most of them were ordinary men, rather tall 
and dark-haired, and grim but not particularly evil -looking. But there were 
some others that were horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, 
leering, squint-eyed. Do you know, they reminded me at once of that 
Southerner at Bree: only he was not so obviously ore-like as most of these 
were.' 

'I thought of him too,' said Aragorn. 'We had many of these half-ores 
to deal with at Helm's Deep. It seems plain now that that Southerner was a 




spy of Saruman’s; but whether he was working with the Black Riders, or for 
Saruman alone, I do not know. It is difficult with these evil folk to know 
when they are in league, and when they are cheating one another.' 

'Well, of all sorts together, there must have been ten thousand at the 
very least,' said Merry. 'They took an hour to pass out of the gates. Some 
went off down the highway to the Fords, and some turned away p and went 
eastward. A bridge has been built down there, about a mile away, where the 
river runs in a very deep channel. You could see it now, if you stood up. 

They were all singing with harsh voices, and laughing, making a hideous din. 

I thought things looked very black for Rohan. But Treebeard did not move. He 
said: 'My business is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.' 

'But, though I could not see what was happening in the dark, I believe 
that Huorns began to move south, as soon as the gates were shut again. Their 
business was with Ores I think. They were far down the valley in the 
morning; or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldn't see through. 

'As soon as Saruman had sent off all his army, our turn came. Treebeard 
put us down, and went up to the gates, and began hammering on the doors, and 
calling for Saruman. There was no answer, except arrows and stones from the 
walls. But arrows are no use against Ents. They hurt them, of course, and 
infuriate them: like stinging flies. But an Ent can be stuck as full of 
ore-arrows as a pin-cushion, and take no serious harm. They cannot be 
poisoned, for one thing; and their skin seems to be very thick, and tougher 
than bark. It takes a very heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously. They 
don't like axes. But there would have to be a great many axe -men to one Ent: 
a man that hacks once at an Ent never gets a chance of a second blow. A 
punch from an Ent-fist crumples up iron like thin tin. 

'When Treebeard had got a few arrows in him, he began to warm up, to 
get positively "hasty", as he would say. He let out a great hoom-hom, and a 
dozen more Ents came striding up. An angry Ent is terrifying. Their fingers, 
and their toes, just freeze on to rock; and they tear it up like 
bread-crust. It was like watching the work of great tree-roots in a hundred 
years, all packed into a few moments. 

'They pushed, pulled, tore, shook, and hammered; and clang-bang, 
crash-crack, in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in ruin; 
and some were already beginning to eat into the walls, like rabbits in a 
sand-pit. I don't know what Saruman thought was happening; but anyway he 
did 




not know how to deal with it. His wizardry may have been falling off lately, 
of course; but anyway I think he has not much grit, not much plain courage 
alone in a tight place without a lot of slaves and machines and things, if 
you know what I mean. Very different from old Gandalf. I wonder if his fame 
was not all along mainly due to his cleverness in settling at Isengard.’ 

'No,' said Aragorn. 'Once he was as great as his fame made him. His 
knowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands marvellously 
skilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. The wise he could 
persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still 
keeps. There are not many in Middle-earth that I should say were safe, if 
they were left alone to talk with him, even now when he has suffered a 
defeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has 
been laid bare, but very few others.' 

'The Ents are safe,' said Pippin. 'He seems at one time to have got 
round them, but never again. And anyway he did not understand them; and he 
made the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations. He had no 
plan for them, and there was no time to make any, once they had set to work. 
As soon as our attack began, the few remaining rats in Isengard started 
bolting through every hole that the Ents made. The Ents let the Men go, 
after they had questioned them, two or three dozen only down at this end. I 
don't think many ore-folk, of any size, escaped. Not from the Huorns: there 
was a wood full of them all round Isengard by that time, as well as those 
that had gone down the valley. 

'When the Ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to 
rubbish, and what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him, 
Saruman fled in a panic. He seems to have been at the gates when we arrived: 

I expect he came to watch his splendid army march out. When the Ents broke 
their way in, he left in a hurry. They did not spot him at first. But the 
night had opened out, and there was a great light of stars, quite enough for 
Ents to see by, and suddenly Quickbeam gave a cry "The tree-killer, the 
tree-killer!" Quickbeam is a gentle creature, but he hates Saruman all the 
more fiercely for that: his people suffered cruelly from ore-axes. He leapt 
down the path from the inner gate, and he can move like a wind when he is 
roused. There was a pale figure hurrying away in and out of the shadows of 
the pillars, and it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower-door. But it 
was a near thing. Quickbeam was so hot after him, that he was within a step 
or two of being caught and strangled when he slipped in through the door. 




’When Saruman was safe back in Orthanc, it was not long before he set 
some of his precious machinery to work. By that time there were many Ents 
inside Isengard: some had followed Quickbeam, and others had burst in from 
the north and east; they were roaming about and doing a great deal of 
damage. Suddenly up came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over 
the plain began to spout and belch. Several of the Ents got scorched and 
blistered. One of them, Beechbone I think he was called, a very tall 
handsome Ent, got caught in a spray of some liquid fire and burned like a 
torch: a horrible sight. 

'That sent them mad. I thought that they had been really roused before; 
but I was wrong. I saw what it was like at last. It was staggering. They 
roared and boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to crack and fall at the 
mere noise of them. Merry and I lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks 
into our ears. Round and round the rock of Orthanc the Ents went striding 
and storming like a howling gale, breaking pillars, hurling avalanches of 
boulders down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like 
leaves. The tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind. I saw iron 
posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up hundreds of feet, and smash 
against the windows of Orthanc. But Treebeard kept his head. lie had not had 
any burns, luckily. He did not want his folk to hurt themselves in their 
fury, and he did not want Saruman to escape out of some hole in the 
confusion. Many of the Ents were hurling themselves against the 
Orthanc -rock; but that defeated them. It is very smooth and hard. Some 
wizardry is in it, perhaps, older and stronger than Saruman’s. Anyway they 
could not get a grip on it, or make a crack in it; and they were bruising 
and wounding themselves against it. ’So Treebeard went out into the ring and 
shouted. His enormous voice rose above all the din. There was a dead 
silence, suddenly. In it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the 
tower. That had a queer effect on the Ents. They had been boiling over; now 
they became cold, grim as ice, and quiet. They left the plain and gathered 
round Treebeard, standing quite still. He spoke to them for a little in 
their own language; I think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his 
old head long before. Then they just faded silently away in the grey light. 

Day was dawning by that time. 

'They set a watch on the tower, I believe, but the watchers were so 
well hidden in shadows and kept so still, that I could not see them. The 
others went away north. All that day they were busy, out of sight. Most of 




the time we were left alone. It was a dreary day; and we wandered about a 
bit, though we kept out of the view of the windows of Orthanc, as much as we 
could: they stared at us so threateningly. A good deal of the time we spent 
looking for something to eat. And also we sat and talked, wondering what was 
happening away south in Rohan, and what had become of all the rest of our 
Company. Every now and then we could hear in the distance the rattle and 
fall of stone, and thudding noises echoing in the hills. 

’In the afternoon we walked round the circle, and went to have a look 
at what was going on. There was a great shadowy wood of Huorns at the head 
of the valley, and another round the northern wall. We did not dare to go 
in. But there was a rending, tearing noise of work going on inside. Ents and 
Huorns were digging great pits and trenches, and making great pools and 
dams, gathering all the waters of the Isen and every other spring and stream 
that they could find. We left them to it. 

'At dusk Treebeard came back to the gate. He was humming and booming to 
himself, and seemed pleased. He stood and stretched his great arms and legs 
and breathed deep. I asked him if he was tired. 

' "Tired?" he said, "tired? Well no, not tired, but stiff. I need a 
good draught of Entwash. We have worked hard; we have done more 
stone -cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long 
year 

before. But it is nearly finished. When night falls do not linger near this 
gate or in the old tunnel! Water may come through-and it will be foul water 
for a while, until all the filth of Saruman is washed away. Then Isen can 
run clean again." He began to pull down a bit more of the walls, in a 
leisurely sort of way, just to amuse himself. 

'We were just wondering where it would be safe to lie and get some 
sleep, when the most amazing thing of all happened. There was the sound of a 
rider coming swiftly up the road. Merry and I lay quiet, and Treebeard hid 
himself in the shadows under the arch. Suddenly a great horse came striding 
up, like a flash of silver. It was already dark, but I could see the rider's 
face clearly: it seemed to shine, and all his clothes were white. I just sat 
up, staring, with my mouth open. I tried to call out, and couldn't. 

'There was no need. He halted just by us and looked down at us. 
'Gandalf!' I said at last, but my voice was only a whisper. Did he say: 

"Hullo, Pippin! This is a pleasant surprise!"? No, indeed! He said: "Get up, 
you tom-fool of a Took! Where, in the name of wonder, in all this ruin is 




Treebeard? I want him. Quick!" 

’Treebeard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once; and 
there was a strange meeting. I was surprised, because neither of them seemed 
surprised at all. Gandalf obviously expected to find Treebeard here; and 
Treebeard might almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose 
to meet him. Yet we had told the old Entail about Moria. But then I 
remembered a queer look he gave us at the time. I can only suppose that he 
had seen Gandalf or had some news of him, but would not say anything in a 
hurry. "Don’t be hasty" is his motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say 
much about Gandalf s movements when he is not there. 

'"Hoorn! Gandalf!" said Treebeard. "I am glad you have come. Wood and 
water, stock and stone, I can master; but there is a Wizard to manage here." 

'"Treebeard," said Gandalf. "I need your help. You have done much, but 
I need more. I have about ten thousand Ores to manage." 

'Then those two went off and had a council together in some corner. It 
must have seemed very hasty to Treebeard, for Gandalf was in a tremendous 
hurry, and was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of 
hearing. They were only away a matter of minutes, perhaps a quarter of an 
hour. Then Gandalf came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. He 
did say he was glad to see us, then. 

"'But Gandalf," I cried, "where have you been? And have you seen the 
others?" 

"'Wherever I have been, I am back," he answered in the genuine Gandalf 
manner. "Yes, I have seen some of the others. But news must wait. This is a 
perilous night, and I must ride fast. But the dawn may be brighter; and if 
so, we shall meet again. Take care of yourselves, and keep away from 
Orthanc! Good-bye!" 

'Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone. He had evidently 
learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it. He looked at us and said: 

"Hm, well, I find you are not such hasty folk as I thought. You said much 
less than you might, and not more than you should. Hm, this is a bundle of 
news and no mistake! Well, now Treebeard must get busy again." 

'Before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it did not cheer 
us up at all. But for the moment we thought more about you three than about 
Frodo and Sam, or about poor Boromir. For we gathered that there was a great 
battle going on, or soon would be, and that you were in it, and might never 
come out of it. 




'"Huorns will help," said Treebeard. Then he went away and we did not 
see him again until this morning. 

'It was deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see 
nothing beyond it. Mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great 
blanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of 
rustlings, creakings, and a murmur like voices passing. I think that 
hundreds more of the Huorns must have been passing by to help in the battle. 
Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of 
lightning far away across Rohan. Every now and then we could see 
mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, 
and then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but 
different. At times the whole valley echoed. 

'It must have been about midnight when the Ents broke the dams and 
poured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall, down into 
Isengard. The Huorn-dark had passed, and the thunder had rolled away. The 
Moon was sinking behind the western mountains. 

'Isengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools. They 
glittered in the last light of the Moon, as they spread over the plain. 

Every now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or 
spouthole. Great white steams hissed up. Smoke rose in billows. There were 
explosions and gusts of fire. One great coil of vapour went whirling up, 
twisting round and round Orthanc, until it looked like a tall peak of cloud, 
fiery underneath and moonlit above. And still more water poured in, until at 
last Isengard looked like a huge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling.' 

'We saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we 
came to the mouth of Nan Curunnr,' said Aragorn. 'We feared that Saruman 
was 

brewing some new devilry for us.' 

'Not he!' said Pippin. 'He was probably choking and not laughing any 
more. By the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk down into all 
the holes, and there was a dense fog. We took refuge in that guardroom over 
there; and we had rather a fright. The lake began to overflow and pour out 
through the old tunnel, and the water was rapidly rising up the steps. We 
thought we were going to get caught like Ores in a hole; but we found a 
winding stair at the back of the store-room that brought us out on top of 
the arch. It was a squeeze to get out, as the passages had been cracked and 
half blocked with fallen stone near the top. There we sat high up above the 




floods and watched the drowning of Isengard. The Ents kept on pouring in 
more water, till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled. The fogs 
slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge umbrella of cloud: it 
must have been a mile high. In the evening there was a great rainbow over 
the eastern hills; and then the sunset was blotted out by a thick drizzle on 
the mountain-sides. It all went very quiet. A few wolves howled mournfully, 
far away. The Ents stopped the inflow in the night, and sent the Isen back 
into its old course. And that was the end of it all. 

’Since then the water has been sinking again. There must be outlets 
somewhere from the caves underneath, I think. If Saruman peeps out of any of 
his windows, it must look an untidy, dreary mess. We felt very lonely. Not 
even a visible Ent to talk to in all the ruin; and no news. We spent the 
night up on top there above the arch, and it was cold and damp and we did 
not sleep. We had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute. 
Saruman is still in his tower. There was a noise in the night like a wind 
coming up the valley. I think the Ents and Huorns that had been away came 
back then; but where they have all gone to now, I don't know. It was a 
misty, moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round again, 
and 

nobody was about. And that is about all there is to tell. It seems almost 
peaceful now after all the turmoil. And safer too, somehow, since Gandalf 
came back. I could sleep!' 

They all fell silent for a while. Gimli re-filled his pipe. 'There is 
one thing I wonder about,' he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder: 
'Wormtongue. You told Thjoden he was with Saruman. How did he get there?' 

'Oh yes, I forgot about him,' said Pippin. 'He did not get here till 
this morning. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when Treebeard 
appeared again. We heard him hooming and calling our names outside. 

"'I have just come round to see how you are faring, my lads,' he said; 

'and to give you some news. Huorns have come back. All's well; aye very well 
indeed!" he laughed, and slapped his thighs. "No more Ores in Isengard, no 
more axes! And there will be folk coming up from the South before the day is 
old; some that you may be glad to see." 

'He had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road. 

We rushed out before the gates, and I stood and stared, half expecting to 
see Strider and Gandalf come riding up at the head of an army. But out of 
the mist there rode a man on an old tired horse; and he looked a queer 




twisted sort of creature himself. There was no one else. When he came, out 
of the mist and suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he 
sat and gaped, and his face went almost green. He was so bewildered that he 
did not seem to notice us at first. When he did, he gave a cry, and tried to 
turn his horse round and ride off. But Treebeard took three strides, put out 
a long arm, and lifted him out of the saddle. His horse bolted in terror, 
and he grovelled on the ground. He said he was Grnma, friend and counsellor 
of the king, and had been sent with important messages from Thjoden to 
Saruman. 

'"No one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full of foul 
Ores," he said, "so I was sent. And I have had a perilous journey, and I am 
hungry and weary. I fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves." 

'I caught the sidelong looks he gave to Treebeard, and I said to myself 
"liar". Treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for several minutes, 
till the wretched man was squirming on the floor. Then at last he said: "Ha, 
hm, I was expecting you, Master Wormtongue." The man started at that name. 
"Gandalf got here first. So I know as much about you as I need, and I know 
what to do with you. Put all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will. 

I am the master of Isengard now, but Saruman is locked in his tower; and you 
can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of." 

'"Let me go, let me go!" said Wormtongue. "I know the way." 

"'You knew the way, I don't doubt," said Treebeard. "But things have 
changed here a little. Go and see!" 

'He let Wormtongue go, and he limped off through the arch with us close 
behind, until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay 
between him and Orthanc. Then he turned to us. 

"'Let me go away!" he whined. "Let me go away! My messages are useless 
now." 

"'They are indeed," said Treebeard. "But you have only two choices: to 
stay with me until Gandalf and your master arrive; or to cross the water. 
Which will you have?" 

'The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot into the 
water; but he drew back. "I cannot swim," he said. 

"'The water is not deep," said Treebeard. "It is dirty, but that will 
not harm you, Master Wormtongue. In you go now!" 

'With that the wretch floundered off into the flood. It rose up nearly 
to his neck before he got too far away for me to see him. The last I saw of 




him was clinging to some old barrel or piece of wood. But Treebeard waded 
after him, and watched his progress. 

'"Well, he has gone in," he said when he returned. "I saw him crawling 
up the steps like a draggled rat. There is someone in the tower still: a 
hand came out and pulled him in. So there he is, and I hope the welcome is 
to his liking. Now I must go and wash myself clean of the slime. I'll be 
away up on the north side, if anyone wants to see me. There is no clean 
water down here fit for an Ent to drink, or to bathe in. So I will ask you 
two lads to keep a watch at the gate for the folk that are coming. There’ll 
be the Lord of the Fields of Rohan, mark you! You must welcome him as well 
as you know how: his men have fought a great fight with the Ores. Maybe, you 
know the right fashion of Men's words for such a lord, better than Ents. 

There have been many lords in the green fields in my time, and I have never 
learned their speech or their names. They will be wanting man-food, and you 
know all about that, I guess. So find what you think is fit for a king to 
eat, if you can." And that is the end of the story. Though I should like to 
know who this Wormtongue is. Was he really the king's counsellor?' 

'He was,' said Aragorn; 'and also Saruman's spy and servant in Rohan. 

Fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. The sight of the ruin of 
all that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost 
punishment enough. But I fear that worse awaits him.' 

'Yes, I don't suppose Treebeard sent him to Orthanc out of kindness,' 
said Merry. 'He seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was 
laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. We spent a busy 
time after that, searching the flotsam, and rummaging about. We found two or 
three store-rooms in different places nearby, above the flood-level. But 
Treebeard sent some Ents down, and they carried off a great deal of the 
stuff. 

"'We want man-food for twenty-five," the Ents said, so you can see that 
somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived. You three 
were evidently meant to go with the great people. But you would not have 
fared any better. We kept as good as we sent, I promise you. Better, because 
we sent no drink. 

"'What about drink?" I said to the Ents. 

"'There is water of Isen," they said, "and that is good enough for Ents 
and Men." But I hope that the Ents may have found time to brew some of their 
draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see Gandalf's beard curling 




when he returns. After the Ents had gone, we felt tired, and hungry. But we 
did not grumble — our labours had been well rewarded. It was through our 
search for man-food that Pippin discovered the prize of all the flotsam, 
those Hornblower barrels. "Pipe-weed is better after food," said Pippin; 
that is how the situation arose.' 

'We understand it all perfectly now,' said Gimli. 

'All except one thing,' said Aragorn: 'leaf from the Southfarthing in 
Isengard. The more I consider it, the more curious I find it. I have never 
been in Isengard, but I have journeyed in this land, and I know well the 
empty countries that lie between Rohan and the Shire. Neither goods nor folk 
have passed that way for many a long year, not openly. Saruman had secret 
dealings with someone in the Shire, I guess. Wormtongues may be found in 
other houses than King Thjoden's. Was there a date on the barrels?' 

'Yes,' said Pippin. 'It was the 1417 crop, that is last year's; no, the 
year before, of course, now: a good year.' 

'Ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, I hope; or else it is 
beyond our reach at present,' said Aragorn. 'Yet I think I shall mention it 
to Gandalf, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.' 

'I wonder what he is doing,' said Merry. 'The afternoon is getting on. 

Let us go and look round! You can enter Isengard now at any rate, Strider, 
if you want to. But it is not a very cheerful sight.' 




Chapter 10. The Voice of Saruman 



They passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones, 
gazing at the dark rock of Orthanc, and its many windows, a menace still in 
the desolation that lay all about it. The waters had now nearly all 
subsided. Here and there gloomy pools remained, covered with scum and 
wreckage; but most of the wide circle was bare again, a wilderness of slime 
and tumbled rock, pitted with blackened holes, and dotted with posts and 
pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that. At the rim of the shattered 
bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great 
storm; and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long 
ravine between the dark arms of the mountains. Across the waste they saw 
riders picking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already 
they were drawing near to Orthanc. 

There is Gandalf, and Thjoden and his men!' said Legolas. 'Let us go 
and meet them!' 

'Walk warily!' said Merry. 'There are loose slabs that may tilt up and 
throw you down into a pit, if you don't take care.' 

They followed what was left of the road from the gates to Orthanc, 
going slowly, for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed. The riders, 
seeing them approach, halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for 
them. Gandalf rode forward to meet them. 

'Well, Treebeard and I have had some interesting discussions, and made 
a few plans,' he said; 'and we have all had some much-needed rest. Now we 
must be going on again. I hope you companions have all rested, too, and 
refreshed yourselves?' 

'We have,' said Merry. 'But our discussions began and ended in smoke. 
Still we feel less ill-disposed towards Saruman than we did.' 

'Do you indeed?' said Gandalf. 'Well, I do not. I have now a last task 
to do before I go: I must pay Saruman a farewell visit. Dangerous, and 
probably useless; but it must be done. Those of you who wish may come with 
me — but beware! And do not jest! This is not the time for it.' 

'I will come,' said Gimli. 'I wish to see him and learn if he really 
looks like you.' 

'And how will you learn that, Master Dwarf?' said Gandalf. 'Saruman 




could look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. And are 
you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits? Well, we shall see, 
perhaps. He may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes 
together. But I have ordered all the Ents to remove themselves from sight, 
so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out.' 

’What's the danger?’ asked Pippin. 'Will he shoot at us, and pour fire 
out of the windows; or can he put a spell on us from a distance?' 

'The last is most likely, if you ride to his door with a light heart,' 
said Gandalf. 'But there is no knowing what he can do, or may choose to try. 

A wild beast cornered is not safe to approach. And Saruman has powers you do 
not guess. Beware of his voice!' 

They came now to the foot of Orthanc. It was black, and the rock 
gleamed as if it were wet. The many faces of the stone had sharp edges as 
though they had been newly chiselled. A few scorings, and small flake-like 
splinters near the base, were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the 
Ents. 

On the eastern side, in the angle of two piers, there was a great door, 
high above the ground; and over it was a shuttered window, opening upon a 
balcony hedged with iron bars. Up to the threshold of the door there mounted 
a flight of twenty-seven broad stairs, hewn by some unknown art of the same 
black stone. This was the only entrance to the tower; but many tall windows 
were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like 
little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns. 

At the foot of the stairs Gandalf and the king dismounted. 'I will go 
up,' said Gandalf. 'I have been in Orthanc and I know my peril.' 

'And I too will go up,' said the king. 'I am old, and fear no peril any 
more. I wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong. 
Jomer 

shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.' 

'As you will,' said Gandalf. 'Aragorn shall come with me. Let the 
others await us at the foot of the stairs. They will hear and see enough, if 
there is anything to hear or see.' 

'Nay!' said Gimli. 'Legolas and I wish for a closer view. We alone here 
represent our kindred. We also will come behind.' 

'Come then!' said Gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and 
Thjoden went beside him. 

The Riders of Rohan sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of 




the stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fearing what might 
befall their lord. Merry and Pippin sat on the bottom step, feeling both 
unimportant and unsafe. 

'Half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered Pippin. 'I wish I 
could slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed! What did we come for? We are 
not wanted.' 

Gandalf stood before the door of Orthanc and beat on it with his staff. 

It rang with a hollow sound. 'Saruman, Saruman!' he cried in a loud 
commanding voice. 'Saruman come forth!' 

For some time there was no answer. At last the window above the door 
was unbarred, hut no figure could be seen at its dark opening. 

'Who is it?' said a voice. 'What do you wish?' 

Thjoden started. 'I know that voice,' he said, 'and I curse the day 
when I first listened to it.' 

'Go and fetch Saruman, since you have become his footman, Grnma 
Wormtongue!' said Gandalf. 'And do not waste our time!' 

The window closed. They waited. Suddenly another voice spoke, low and 
melodious, its very sound an enchantment. Those who listened unwarily to 
that voice could seldom report the words that they heard; and if they did, 
they wondered, for little power remained in them. Mostly they remembered 
only that it was a delight to hear the voice speaking, all that it said 
seemed wise and reasonable, and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to 
seem wise themselves. When others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth 
by 

contrast; and if they gainsaid the voice, anger was kindled in the hearts of 
those under the spell. Fur some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke 
to them, and when it spake to another they smiled, as men do who see through 
a juggler's trick while others gape at it. For many the sound of the voice 
alone was enough to hold them enthralled; but for those whom it conquered 
the spell endured when they were far away, and ever they heard that soft 
voice whispering and urging them. But none were unmoved; none rejected its 
pleas and its commands without an effort of mind and will, so long as its 
master had control of it. 

'Well?' it said now with gentle question. 'Why must you disturb my 
rest? Will you give me no peace at all by night or day?' Its tone was that 
of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved. 

They looked up, astonished, for they had heard no sound of his coming; 




and they saw a figure standing at the rail, looking down upon them: an old 
man, swathed in a great cloak, the colour of which was not easy to tell, for 
it changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred. His face was long, 
with a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the 
look that they now bore was grave and benevolent, and a little weary. His 
hair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed about his lips 
and ears. 

'Like, and yet unlike,’ muttered Gimli. 

'But come now,' said the soft voice. 'Two at least of you I know by 
name. Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or 
counsel here. But you, Thjoden Lord of the Mark of Rohan are declared by 
your noble devices, and still more by the fair countenance of the House of 
Eorl. O worthy son of Thengel the Thrice-renowned! Why have you not 
come 

before, and as a friend? Much have I desired to see you, mightiest king of 
western lands, and especially in these latter years, to save you from the 
unwise and evil counsels that beset you ! Is it yet too late? Despite the 
injuries that have been done to me, in which the men of Rohan, alas! have 
had some part, still I would save you, and deliver you from the ruin that 
draws nigh inevitably, if you ride upon this road which you have taken. 
Indeed I alone can aid you now.' 

Thjoden opened his mouth as if to speak, but he said nothing. He looked 
up at the face of Saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and 
then to Gandalf at his side; and he seemed to hesitate. Gandalf made no 
sign; but stood silent as stone, as one waiting patiently for some call that 
has not yet come. The Riders stirred at first, murmuring with approval of 
the words of Saruman; and then they too were silent, as men spell-bound. It 
seemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their 
lord. Rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with Thjoden. And over 
their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the Mark 
in a darkness to which Gandalf was driving them, while Saruman stood beside 
a door of escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through. 
There was a heavy silence. 

It was Gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly. 'The words of this wizard 
stand on their heads,' he growled, gripping the handle of his axe. 'In the 
language of Orthanc help means ruin, and saving means slaying, that is 
plain. But we do not come here to beg.' 




’Peace!' said Saruman, and for a fleeting moment his voice was less 
suave, and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone. 'I do not speak to 
you yet, Gimli Gluin's son,' he said. ’Far away is your home and small 
concern of yours are the troubles of this land. But it was not by design of 
your own that you became embroiled in them, and so I will not blame such 
part as you have played-a valiant one, I doubt not. But I pray you, allow me 
first to speak with the King of Rohan, my neighbour, and once my friend. 

’What have you to say, Thjoden King? Will you have peace with me, and 
all the aid that my knowledge, founded in long years, can bring? Shall we 
make our counsels together against evil days, and repair our injuries with 
such good will that our estates shall both come to fairer flower than ever 
before?' 

Still Thjoden did not answer. Whether he strove with anger or doubt 
none could say. Jomer spoke. 

'Lord, hear me!' he said. 'Now we feel the peril that we were warned 
of. Have we ridden forth to victory, only to stand at last amazed by an old 
liar with honey on his forked tongue? So would the trapped wolf speak to the 
hounds, if he could. What aid can he give to you, forsooth? All he desires 
is to escape from his plight. But will you parley with this dealer in 
treachery and murder? Remember Thjodred at the Fords, and the grave of 
Hbma 

in Helm's Deep!' 

'If we speak of poisoned tongues what shall we say of yours, young 
serpent?' said Saruman, and the flash of his anger was now plain to see. 

'But come, Jomer, Jomund's son!' he went on in his soft voice again. To 
every man h part. Valour in arms is yours, and you win high honour thereby. 
Slay whom your lord names as enemies, and be content. Meddle not in policies 
which you do not understand. But maybe, if you become a king, you Will find 
that he must choose his friends with care. The friendship of Saruman and the 
power of Orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside, whatever grievances, real 
or fancied, may lie behind. You have won a battle but not a war and that 
with help on which you cannot count again. You may find the Shadow of the 
Wood at your own door next: it is wayward, and senseless, and has no love 
for Men. 

'But my lord of Rohan, am I to be called a murderer, because valiant 
men have fallen in battle? If you go to war, needlessly, for I did not 
desire it, then men will be slain. But if I am a murderer on that account, 




then all the House of Eorl is stained with murder; for they have fought many 
wars, and assailed many who defied them. Yet with some they have afterwards 
made peace, none the worse for being politic. I say, Thjoden King: shall we 
have peace and friendship, you and I? It is ours to command ' 

'We will have peace,' said Thjoden at last thickly and with an effort. 

Several of the Riders cried out gladly. Thjoden held up his hand. 'Yes, we 
will have peace,' he said, now in a clear voice, 'we will have peace, when 
you and all your works have perished — and the works of your dark master to 
whom you would deliver us. You are a liar. Saruman, and a corrupter of men's 
hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the 
claw of Mordor. Cruel and cold! Even if your war on me was just as it was 
not, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and 
mine for your own profit as you desired — even so, what will you say of 
your torches in Westfold and the children that lie dead there? And they 
hewed Hbma's body before the gates of the Hornburg, after he was dead. 

When 

you hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows, I 
will have peace with you and Orthanc. So much for the House of Eorl. A 
lesser son of great sires am I, but I do not need to lick your fingers. Turn 
elsewhither. But I fear your voice has lost its charm.' 

The Riders gazed up at Thjoden like men startled out of a dream. Harsh 
as an old raven's their master's voice sounded in their ears after the music 
of Saruman. But Saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath. He leaned 
over the rail as if he would smite the King with his staff. To some suddenly 
it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike. 

'Gibbets and crows!' he hissed, and they shuddered at the hideous 
change. 'Dotard! What is the house of Eorl but a thatched barn where 
brigands drink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor among the 
dogs? Too long have they escaped the gibbet themselves. But the noose comes, 
slow in the drawing, tight and hard in the end. Hang if you will!' Now his 
voice changed, as he slowly mastered himself. 'I know not why I have had the 
patience to speak to you. For I need you not, nor your little band of 
gallopers, as swift to fly as to advance, Thjoden Horsemaster. Long ago I 
offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit. I have offered it again, 
so that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads. You give 
me brag and abuse. So be it. Go back to your huts! 

'But you, Gandalf ! For you at least I am grieved, feeling for your 




shame. How comes it that you can endure such company? For you are proud, 
Gandalf-and not without reason, having a noble mind and eyes that look both 
deep and far. Even now will you not listen to my counsel?' 

Gandalf stirred, and looked up. ’What have you to say that you did not 
say at our last meeting?' he asked. 'Or, perhaps, you have things to unsay?' 

Saruman paused. 'Unsay?' he mused, as if puzzled. 'Unsay? I endeavoured 
to advise you for your own good, but you scarcely listened. You are proud 
and do not love advice, having indeed a store of your own wisdom. But on 
that occasion you erred, I think, misconstruing my intentions wilfully. I 
fear that in my eagerness to persuade you, I lost patience. And indeed I 
regret it. For I bore you no ill-will; and even now I bear none, though you 
return to me in the company of the violent and the ignorant. How should I? 
Are we not both members of a high and ancient order, most excellent in 
Middle-earth? Our friendship would profit us both alike. Much we could still 
accomplish together, to heal the disorders of the world. Let us understand 
one another, and dismiss from thought these lesser folk! Let them wait on 
our decisions ! For the common good I am willing to redress the past, and to 
receive you. Will you not consult with me? Will you not come up?' 

So great was the power that Saruman exerted in this last effort that 
none that stood within hearing were unmoved. But now the spell was wholly 
different. They heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with an 
erring but much-loved minister. But they were shut out, listening at a door 
to words not meant for them: ill-mannered children or stupid servants 
overhearing the elusive discourse of their elders, and wondering how it 
would affect their lot. Of loftier mould these two were made: reverend and 
wise. It was inevitable that they should make alliance. Gandalf would ascend 
into the tower, to discuss deep things beyond their comprehension in the 
high chambers of Orthanc. The door would be closed, and they would be left 
outside, dismissed to await allotted work or punishment. Even in the mind of 
Thjoden the thought took shape, like a shadow of doubt: 'He will betray us; 
he will go — we shall be lost.' 

Then Gandalf laughed. The fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke. 

'Saruman, Saruman!' said Gandalf still laughing. 'Saruman, you missed 
your path in life. You should have been the king's jester and earned your 
bread, and stripes too, by mimicking his counsellors. Ah me!' he paused, 
getting the better of his mirth. 'Understand one another? I fear I am beyond 
your comprehension. But you, Saruman, I understand now too well. I keep a 




clearer memory of your arguments, and deeds, than you suppose. When last I 
visited you, you were the jailor of Mordor, and there I was to be sent. Nay, 
the guest who has escaped from the roof, will think twice before he comes 
back in by the door. Nay, I do not think I will come up. But listen, 
Saruman, for the last time! Will you not come down? Isengard has proved less 
strong than your hope and fancy made it. So may other things in which you 
still have trust. Would it not be well to leave it for a while? To turn to 
new things, perhaps? Think well, Saruman! Will you not come down?' 

A shadow passed over Saruman's face; then it went deathly white. Before 
he could conceal it, they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in 
doubt, loathing to stay and dreading to leave its refuge. For a second he 
hesitated, and no one breathed. Then he spoke, and his voice was shrill and 
cold. Pride and hate were conquering him. 

'Will I come down?' he mocked. 'Does an unarmed man come down to 
speak 

with robbers out of doors? I can hear you w ell enough here. I am no fool, 
and I do not trust you, Gandalf. They do not stand openly on my stairs, but 
I know where the wild wood-demons are lurking, at your command.' 

'The treacherous are ever distrustful,' answered Gandalf wearily. 'But 
you need not fear for your skin. I do not wish to kill you, or hurt you, as 
you would know, if you really understood me. And I have the power to protect 
you. I am giving you a last chance. You can leave Orthanc, free — if you 
choose.' 

'That sounds well,' sneered Saruman. 'Very much in the manner of 
Gandalf the Grey: so condescending, and so very kind. I do not doubt that 
you would find Orthanc commodious, and my departure convenient. But 
why 

should I wish to leave? And what do you mean by 'free'? There are 
conditions, I presume?' 

'Reasons for leaving you can see from your windows.' answered Gandalf. 
'Others will occur to your thought. Your servants are destroyed and 
scattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you have cheated 
your new master, or tried to do so. When his eye turns hither, it will be 
the red eye of wrath. But when I say 'free', I mean 'free': free from bond, 
of chain or command: to go where you will, even, even to Mordor, Saruman, if 
you desire. But you will first surrender to me the Key of Orthanc, and your 
staff. They shall be pledges of your conduct, to be returned later, if you 




merit them.' 

Saruman's face grew livid, twisted with rage, and a red light was 
kindled in his eyes. He laughed wildly. 'Later!' he cried, and his voice 
rose to a scream. 'Later! Yes, when you also have the Keys ofBarad-dyr 
itself, I suppose; and the crowns of seven kings, and the rods of the Five 
Wizards, and have purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes larger than 
those that you wear now. A modest plan. Hardly one in which my help is 
needed! I have other things to do. Do not be a fool. If you wish to treat 
with me, while you have a chance, go away, and come back when you are 
sober! 

And leave behind these cut-throats and small rag-tag that dangle at your 
tail! Good day!' He turned and left the balcony. 

'Come back, Saruman!' said Gandalf in a commanding voice. To the 
amazement of the others, Saruman turned again, and as if dragged against his 
will, he came slowly back to the iron rail, leaning on it, breathing hard. 

His face was lined and shrunken. His hand clutched his heavy black staff 
like a claw. 

'I did not give you leave to go,' said Gandalf sternly. 'I have not 
finished. You have become a fool, Saruman, and yet pitiable. You might still 
have turned away from folly and evil, and have been of service. But you 
choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots. Stay then! But I warn 
you. you will not easily come out again. Not unless the dark hands of the 
East stretch out to take you. Saruman!' he cried, and his voice grew in 
power and authority. 'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed. 
I am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death. You have no colour 
now, 

and I cast you from the order and from the Council.' 

He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice. 'Saruman, 
your staff is broken.' There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in 
Saruman's hand, and the head of it fell down at Gandalf s feet. 'Go!' said 
Gandalf. With a cry Saruman fell back and crawled away. At that moment a 
heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above. It glanced off the iron 
rail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf 's head, it smote 
the stair on which he stood. The rail rang and snapped. The stair cracked 
and splintered in glittering sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on 
down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark, but glowing with a heart of fire. 

As it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up. 




'The murderous rogue!' cried Jomer. But Gandalf was unmoved. No, that 
was not thrown b Saruman, he said; nor even at his bidding, I think. It came 
from a window far above. A parting shot from Master Wormtongue, I fancy, 
but 

ill aimed.' 

'The aim was poor, maybe, because he could not make up his mind which 
he hated more, you or Saruman,' said Aragorn. 

'That may be so,' said Gandalf. 'Small comfort will those two have in 
their companionship: they will gnaw one another with words. But the 
punishment is just. If Wormtongue ever comes out of Orthanc alive, it will 
be more than he deserves. 

'Here, my lad, I'll take that! I did not ask you to handle it,' he 
cried, turning sharply and seeing Pippin coming up the steps, slowly, as if 
he were bearing a great weight. He went down to meet him and hastily took 
the dark globe from the hobbit, wrapping it in the folds of his cloak. 'I 
will take care of this,' he said. 'It is not a thing, I guess, that Saruman 
would have chosen to cast away.' 

'But he may have other things to cast,' said Gimli. 'If that is the end 
of the debate, let us go out of stone's throw, at least!' 

'It is the end,' said Gandalf. 'Let us go.' 

They turned their backs on the doors of Orthanc, and went down. The 
riders hailed the king with joy, and saluted Gandalf. The spell of Saruman 
was broken: they had seen him come at call, and crawl away, dismissed. 

'Well, that is done,' said Gandalf. 'Now I must find Treebeard and tell 
him how things have gone.' 

'He will have guessed, surely?' said Merry. 'Were they likely to end 
any other way?' 

'Not likely,' answered Gandalf, 'though they came to the balance of a 
hair. But I had reasons for trying; some merciful and some less so. First 
Saruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning. He cannot be 
both 

tyrant and counsellor. When the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret. 

Yet he fell into the trap, and tried to deal with his victims piece-meal, 
while others listened. Then I gave him a last choice and a fair one: to 
renounce both Mordor and his private schemes, and make amends by helping 
us 

in our need. He knows our need, none better. Great service he could have 




rendered. But he has chosen to withhold it, and keep the power of Orthanc. 
He will not serve, only command. He lives now in terror of the shadow of 
Mordor, and yet he still dreams of riding the storm. Unhappy fool! He will 
be devoured, if the power of the East stretches out its arms to Isengard. We 
cannot destroy Orthanc from without, but Sauron — who knows what he can 
do?' 

'And what if Sauron does not conquer? What will you do to him?' asked 
Pippin. 

'I? Nothing!' said Gandalf. 'I will do nothing to him. I do not wish 
for mastery. What w ill become of him? I cannot say. I grieve that so much 
that was good now festers in the tower. Still for us things have not gone 
badly. Strange are the turns of fortune! Often does hatred hurt itself! I 
guess that, even if we had entered in, we could have found few treasures in 
Orthanc more precious than the thing which Wormtongue threw down at us.' 

A shrill shriek; suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above. 

'It seems that Saruman thinks so too,' said Gandalf. 'Let us leave 
them!' 

They returned now to the ruins of the gate. Hardly had they passed out 
under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where they 
had stood, Treebeard and a dozen other Ents came striding up. Aragorn, Gimli 
and Legolas gazed at them in wonder. 

'Here are three of my companions, Treebeard,' said Gandalf. 'I have 
spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.' He named them one by one. 

The Old Ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in 
turn. Last he turned to Legolas. 'So you have come all the way from 
Mirkwood, my good Elf? A very great forest it used to be!' 

'And still is,' said Legolas. 'But not so great that we who dwell there 
ever tire of seeing new trees. I should dearly love to journey in Fangorn's 
Wood. I scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and I did not wish to turn 
back.' 

Treebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. 'I hope you may have your wish, 
ere the hills be much older,' he said. 

'I will come, if I have the fortune,' said Legolas. 'I have made a 
bargain with my friend that, if all goes well, we will visit Fangorn 
together — by your leave.' 

'Any Elf that comes with you will be welcome,' said Treebeard. 

'The friend I speak of is not an Elf,' said Legolas; 'I mean Gimli, 




Gluin's son here.' Gimli bowed low, and the axe slipped from his belt and 
clattered on the ground. 

'Hoom, hm! Ah now,' said Treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. A dwarf 
and an axe-bearer! Hoom! I have good will to Elves; but you ask much. This 
is a strange friendship!' ’Strange it may seem,' said Legolas; 'but while 
Gimli lives I shall not come to Fangorn alone. His axe is not for trees, but 
for ore-necks, O Fangorn, Master of Fangorn's Wood. Forty -two he hewed in 
the battle.' 

'Hoo! Come now!' said Treebeard. 'That is a better story! Well, well, 
things will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them. But 
now we must part for a while. Day is drawing to an end, yet Gandalf says you 
must go ere nightfall, and the Ford of the Mark is eager for his own house.' 

'Yes, we must go, and go now,' said Gandalf. 'I fear that I must take 
your gatekeepers from you. But you will manage well enough without them.' 

'Maybe I shall,' said Treebeard. 'But I shall miss them. We have become 
friends in so short a while that I think I must be getting hasty — growing 
backwards towards youth, perhaps. But there, they are the first new thing 
under Sun or Moon that I have seen for many a long, long day. I shall not 
forget them. I have put their names into the Fong Fist. Ents will remember 
it. 

Ents the earthborn, old as mountains, 

the wide-walkers, water drinking; 

and hungry as hunters, the Hobbit children, 

the laughing-folk, the little people, 

they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed. Fare you well! 

But if you hear news up in your pleasant land, in the Shire, send me word! 
You know what I mean: word or sight of the Entwives. Come yourselves if 
you 
can!' 

'We will!' said Merry and Pippin together, and they turned away 
hastily. Treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his 
head thoughtfully. Then he turned to Gandalf. 

'So Saruman would not leave?' he said. 'I did not think he would. His 
heart is as rotten as a black Huorn's. Still, if I were overcome and all my 
trees destroyed, I would not come while I had one dark hole left to hide 
in.' 

'No,' said Gandalf. 'But you have not plotted to cover all the world 




with your trees and choke all other living things. But there it is, Saruman 
remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can. He has the 
Key of Orthanc. But he must not be allowed to escape.' 

'Indeed no! Ents will see to that,' said Treebeard. 'Saruman shall not 
set foot beyond the rock, without my leave. Ents will watch over him.’ 

'Good!' said Gandalf. 'That is what I hoped. Now I can go and turn to 
other matters with one care the less. But you must be wary. The waters have 
gone down. It will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower, I fear. I 
do not doubt that there were deep ways delved under Orthanc, and that 
Saruman hopes to go and come unmarked, before long. If you will undertake 
the labour, I beg you to pour in the waters again; and do so, until Isengard 
remains a standing pool, or you discover the outlets. When all the 
underground places are drowned, and the outlets blocked, then Saruman must 
stay upstairs and look out of the windows.' 

'Leave it to the Ents!’ said Treebeard. 'We shall search the valley 
from head to foot and peer under every pebble. Trees are coming back to live 
here, old trees, wild trees. The Watchwood we will call it. Not a squirrel 
will go here, but I shall know of it. Leave it to Ents ! Until seven times 
the years in which he tormented us have passed, we shall not tire of 
watching him.' 




Chapter 11. The Palantnr 



The sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when 
Gandalf and his companions, and the king with his Riders, set out again from 
Isengard. Gandalf took Merry behind him, and Aragorn took Pippin. Two of 
the 

king's men went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down 
into the valley. The others followed at an easy pace. 

Ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long 
arms uplifted, but they made no sound. Merry and Pippin looked back, when 
they had passed some way down the winding road. Sunlight was still shining 
in the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey ruins falling into 
darkness. Treebeard stood alone there now, like the distant stump of an old 
tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon the sunny ledge far 
away on the borders of Fangorn. 

They came to the pillar of the White Hand. The pillar was still 
standing, but the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small 
pieces. Right in the middle of the road the long forefinger lay, white in 
the dusk, its red nail darkening to black. 

'The Ents pay attention to every detail!' said Gandalf. 

They rode on, and evening deepened in the valley. 

'Are we riding far tonight, Gandalf?' asked Merry after a while. 'I 
don't know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but the 
rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.' 

'So you heard that?' said Gandalf. 'Don't let it rankle! Be thankful no 
longer words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it is any comfort 
to your pride, I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in 
his thoughts than all the rest of us. Who you are; how you came there, and 
why; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped 
when all the Ores perished — it is with those little riddles that the great 
mind ^ Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Meriadoc, is a compliment, if 
you feel honoured by his concern.' 

'Thank you!' said Merry. 'But it is a greater honour to dangle at your 
tail, Gandalf. For one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a 




question a second time. Are we riding far tonight?' 

Gandalf laughed. 'A most unquenchable hobbit! All Wizards should have a 
hobbit or two in their care — to teach them the meaning of the word, and to 
correct them. I beg your pardon. But I have given thought even to these 
simple matters. We will ride for a few hours, gently, until we come to the 
end of the valley. Tomorrow we must ride faster. 

’When we came, we meant to go straight from Isengard back to the king's 
house at Edoras over the plains, a ride of some days. But we have taken 
thought and changed the plan. Messengers have gone ahead to Helm's Deep, to 
warn them that the king is returning tomorrow. He will ride from there with 
many men to Dunharrow by paths among the hills. From now on no more than 
two 

or three together are to go openly over the land, by day or night, when it 
can be avoided.' 

'Nothing or a double helping is your way!' said Merry. 'I am afraid I 
was not looking beyond tonight's bed. Where and what are Helm's Deep and all 
the rest of it? I don't know anything about this country.' 

'Then you'd best learn something, if you wish to understand what is 
happening. But not just now, and not from me: I have too many pressing 
things to think about.' 

'All right, I'll tackle Strider by the camp-fire: he's less testy. But 
why all this secrecy? I thought we'd won the battle!' 

Yes, we have won, but only the first victor and that in itself 
increases our danger. There was some link between Isengard and Mordor, 
which 

I have not yet fathomed. How they exchanged news I am not sure; but they did 
so. The Eye of Barad-dyr will be looking impatiently towards the Wizard's 
Vale, I think; and towards Rohan. The less it sees the better.' 

The road passed slowly, winding down the valley. Now further, and now 
nearer Isen flowed in its stony bed. Night came down from the mountains. All 
the mists were gone. A chill wind blew. The moon, now waxing round, filled 
the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen. The shoulders of the mountain to 
their right sloped down to bare hills. The wide plains opened grey before 
them. 

At last they halted. Then they turned aside, leaving the highway and 
taking to the sweet upland turf again. Going westward a mile or so they came 
to a dale. It opened southward, leaning back into the slope of round Dol 




Baran, the last hill of the northern ranges, greenfooted, crowned with 
heather. The sides of the glen were shaggy with last year's bracken, among 
which the tight-curled fronds of spring were just thrusting through the 
sweet-scented earth. Thornbushes grew thick upon the low banks, and under 
them they made their camp, two hours or so before the middle of the night. 
They lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of a spreading hawthorn, 
tall as a tree, writhen with age; but hale in every limb. Buds were swelling 
at each twig's tip. 

Guards were set, two at a watch. The rest, after they had supped, 
wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept. The hobbits lay in a 
corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken. Merry was sleepy, but 
Pippin now seemed curiously restless. The bracken cracked and rustled, as he 
twisted and turned. 

'What’s the matter?' asked Merry. 'Are you lying on an ant-hill?' 

'No,' said Pippin, 'but I'm not comfortable. I wonder how long it is 
since I slept in a bed?' 

Merry yawned. 'Work it out on your fingers!' he said. 'But you must 
know how long it is since we left Lurien.' 

'Oh, that!' said Pippin. 'I mean a real bed in a bedroom.' 

'Well, Rivendell then,' said Merry. 'But I could sleep anywhere 
tonight.' 

'You had the luck, Merry,' said Pippin softly, after a long pause. 'You 
were riding with Gandalf.' 

'Well, what of it?' 

'Did you get any news, any information out of him?' 

'Yes, a good deal. More than usual. But you heard it all or most of it: 
you were close by, and we were talking no secrets. But you can go with him 
tomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him-and if he'll have you.' 

'Can I? Good! But he's close, isn't he? Not changed at all.' 

'Oh yes, he is!' said Merry, waking up a little, and beginning to 
wonder what was bothering his companion. 'He has grown, or something. He 
can 

be both kinder and more alarming, merrier and more solemn than before, I 
think. He has changed; but we have not had a chance to see how much, yet. 
But think of the last part of that business with Saruman! Remember Saruman 
was once Gandalf s superior: head of the Council, whatever that may be 




exactly. He was Saruman the White. Gandalf is the White now. Saruman 
came 

when he was told, and his rod was taken; and then he was just told to go, 
and he went!' 

'Well, if Gandalf has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's 
all,' Pippin argued. 'That-glass ball, now. He seemed mighty pleased with 
it. He knows or guesses something about it. But does he tell us what? No, 
not a word. Yet I picked it up, and I saved it from rolling into a pool. 

Here, I'll take that, my lad — that's all. I wonder what it is? It felt so 
very heavy.' Pippin's voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself. 

'Hullo!' said Merry. 'So that's what is bothering you? Now, Pippin my 
lad, don't forget Gildor's saying — the one Sam used to quote: Do not 
meddle in the at Fairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.' 

'But our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the 
affairs of Wizards,' said Pippin. 'I should like a bit of information as 
well as danger. I should like a look at that ball.' 

'Go to sleep!' said Merry. 'You'll get information enough, sooner or 
later. My dear Pippin, no Took ever beat a Brandybuck for inquisitiveness; 
but is this the time, I ask you?' 

'All right! What's the harm in my telling you what I should like: a 
look at that stone? I know I can't have it, with old Gandalf sitting on it, 
like a hen on an egg. But it doesn't help much to get no more from you than 
a you-can 't-have-it so -go -to -sleep ! ' 

'Well, what else could I say?' said Merry. 'I'm sorry, Pippin, but you 
really must wait till the morning. I'll be as curious as you like after 
breakfast, and I'll help in any way I can at wizard-wheedling. But I can't 
keep awake any longer. If I yawn any more, I shall split at the ears. Good 
night!' 

Pippin said no more. He lay still now, but sleep remained far away; and 
it was not encouraged by the sound of Merry breathing softly, asleep in a 
few minutes after saying good night. 'The thought of the dark globe seemed 
to grow stronger as all grew quiet. Pippin felt again its weight in his 
hands, and saw again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for 
a moment. He tossed and turned and tried to think of something else. 

At last he could stand it no longer. He got up and looked round. It was 
chilly, and he wrapped his cloak about him. The moon was shining cold and 
white, down into the dell, and the shadows of the bushes were black. All 




about lay sleeping shapes. The two guards were not in view: they were up on 
the hill, perhaps, or hidden in the bracken. Driven by some impulse that he 
did not understand, Pippin walked softly to where Gandalf lay. He looked 
down at him. The wizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there 
was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes. Pippin stepped back hastily. 

But Gandalf made no sign; and drawn forward once more, half against his 
will, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard's head. He was rolled 
in a blanket, with his cloak spread over the top; and close beside him, 
between his right side and his bent arm, there was a hummock, something 
round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off 
it to the ground. 

Hardly breathing, Pippin crept nearer, foot by foot. At last he knelt 
down. Then he put his hands out stealthily, and slowly lifted the lump up: 
it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected. 'Only some bundle of 
oddments, perhaps, after all,' he thought with a strange sense of relief; 
but he did not put the bundle down again. He stood for a moment clasping it. 
Then an idea came into his mind. He tiptoed away, found a large stone, and 
came back. 

Quickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and kneeling 
down, laid it back by the wizard's hand. Then at last he looked at the thing 
that he had uncovered. There it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and 
dead, lying bare before his knees. Pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in 
his own cloak, and half turned to go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf 
moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange 
tongue; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone, then he sighed 
and did not move again. 

'You idiotic fool!' Pippin muttered to himself. 'You're going to get 
yourself into frightful trouble. Put it back quick!' But he found now that 
his knees quaked, and he did not dare to go near enough to the wizard to 
reach the bundle. 'I'll never get it back now without waking him,' he 
thought, 'not till I'm a bit calmer. S0I may as well have a look first. Not 
just here though!' He stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not far 
from his bed. The moon looked in over the edge of the dell. 

Pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them. He bent 
low over it, looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food, in a 
corner away from others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at it. The air 
seemed still and tense about him. At first the globe was dark, black as jet, 




with the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then there came a faint glow and 
stir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look 
away. Soon all the inside seemed on fire; the ball was spinning, or the 
lights within were revolving. Suddenly the lights went out. He gave a gasp 
and struggled; but he remained bent, clasping the ball with both hands. 
Closer and closer he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly 
for a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still. 

The cry was piercing. The guards leapt down from the banks. All the 
camp was soon astir. 

’So this is the thief!' said Gandalf. Hastily he cast his cloak over 
the globe where it lay. ’But you, Pippin! This is a grievous turn to 
things!’ He knelt by Pippin's body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid, 
with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky. 'The devilry! What mischief has he 
done-to himself, and to all of us?' The wizard's face was drawn and haggard. 

He took Pippin's hand and bent over his face, listening for his breath; 
then he laid his hands on his brow. The hobbit shuddered. His eyes closed. 
He cried out; and sat up. staring in bewilderment at all the faces round 
him, pale in the moonlight. 

'It is not for you, Saruman!' he cried in a shrill and toneless voice 
shrinking away from Gandalf. 'I will send for it at once. Do you understand? 
Say just that!' Then he struggled to get up and escape but Gandalf held him 
gently and firmly. 

'Peregrin Took!' he said. 'Come back!' 

The hobbit relaxed and fell back, clinging to the wizard's hand. 
'Gandalf!' he cried. 'Gandalf! Forgive me!' 

'Forgive you?' said the wizard. 'Tell me first what you have done!' 

'I, I took the ball and looked at it,' stammered Pippin; 'and I saw 
things that frightened me. And I wanted to go away, but I couldn't. And then 
he came and questioned me; and he looked at me, and, and that is all I 
remember.' 

'That won't do,' said Gandalf sternly. 'What did you see, and what did 
you say?' 

Pippin shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. They all stared at 
him in silence, except Merry who turned away. But Gandalf s face was still 
hard. 'Speak!' he said. 

In a low hesitating voice Pippin began again, and slowly his words grew 
clearer and stronger. 'I saw a dark sky, and tall battlements,' he said. 




'And tiny stars. It seemed very far away and long ago, yet hard and clear. 
Then the stars went in and out-they were cut off by things with wings. Very 
big, I think, really; but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round 
the tower. I thought there were nine of them. One began to fly straight 
towards me, getting bigger and bigger. It had a horrible — no, no! I can't 
say. 

'I tried to get away, because I thought it would fly out; but when it 
had covered all the globe, it disappeared. Then he came. He did not speak so 
that I could hear words. He just looked, and I understood. 

"'So you have come back? Why have you neglected to report for so long?" 

'I did not answer. He said: "Who are you?" I still did not answer, but 
it hurt me horribly; and he pressed me, so I said: "A hobbit." 

'Then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. It was cruel. 

It was like being stabbed with knives. I struggled. But he said: "Wait a 
moment! We shall meet again soon. Tell Saruman that this dainty is not for 
him. I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!" 

'Then he gloated over me. I felt I was falling to pieces. No, no! I 
can't say any more. I don't remember anything else.' 

'Look at me!' said Gandalf. 

Pippin looked up straight into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze for a 
moment in silence. Then his face grew gentler, and the shadow of a smile 
appeared. He laid his hand softly on Pippin's head. 

'All right!' he said. 'Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no 
lie in your eyes, as I feared. But he did not speak long with you. A fool, 
but an honest fool, you remain, Peregrin Took. Wiser ones might have done 
worse in such a pass. But mark this! You have been saved, and all your 
friends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is called. You cannot count on it 
a second time. If he had questioned you, then and there, almost certainly 
you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too 
eager. He did not want information only: he wanted you, quickly, so that he 
could deal with you in the Dark Tower, slowly. Don't shudder! If you will 
meddle in the affairs of Wizards, you must be prepared to think of such 
things. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not turned out as 
evilly as they might.' 

He lifted Pippin gently and carried him back to his bed. Merry 
followed, and sat down beside him. Lie there and rest, if you can, Pippin!' 
said Gandalf. 'Trust me. If you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of 




it! Such things can be cured. But anyway, my dear hobbit, don't put a lump 
of rock under my elbow again! Now, I will leave you two together for a 
while.' 

With that Gandalf returned to the others, who were still standing by 
the Orthanc-stone in troubled thought. 'Peril comes in the night when least 
expected,' he said. 'We have had a narrow escape!' 

'How is the hobbit, Pippin?' asked Aragorn. 

'I think all will be well now,' answered Gandalf. 'He was not held 
long, and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery. The memory, or the 
horror of it, will probably fade quickly. Too quickly, perhaps. Will you, 
Aragorn, take the Orthanc-stone and guard it? It is a dangerous charge.' 

'Dangerous indeed, but not to all,' said Aragorn. 'There is one who may 
claim it by right. For this assuredly is the palantnr of Orthanc from the 
treasury of Elendil, set here by the Kings of Gondor. Now my hour draws 
near. I will take it.' 

Gandalf looked at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he 
lifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it. 

'Receive it, lord!' he said: 'in earnest of other things that shall be 
given back. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own, do not use it 
— yet! Be wary!' 

'When have I been hasty or unwary, who have waited and prepared for so 
many long years?' said Aragorn. 

'Never yet. Do not then stumble at the end of the road,' answered 
Gandalf. 'But at the least keep this thing secret. You, and all others that 
stand here ! The hobbit, Peregrin, above all should not know where it is 
bestowed. The evil fit may come on him again. For alas ! he has handled it 
and looked in it, as should never have happened. He ought never to have 
touched it in Isengard, and there I should have been quicker. But my mind 
was bent on Saruman, and I did not at once guess the nature of the Stone. 
Then I was weary, and as I lay pondering it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!' 

'Yes, there can be no doubt,' said Aragorn. 'At last we know the link' 
between Isengard and Mordor, and how it worked. Much is explained.' 'Strange 
powers have our enemies, and strange weaknesses!' said Thjoden. 'But it has 
long been said: oft evil will shall evil mar.' 

'That many times is seen,' said Gandalf. 'But at this time we have been 
strangely fortunate. Maybe, I have been saved by this hobbit from a grave 
blunder. I had considered whether or not to probe this Stone myself to find 




its uses. Had I done so, I should have been revealed to him myself. I am not 
ready for such a trial, if indeed I shall ever be so: But even if I found 
the power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for him to see me, yet 
— until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer.' 

'That hour is now come, I think,' said Aragorn. 

'Not yet,' said Gandalf. 'There remains a short while of doubt which we 
must use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that the Stone was in Orthanc — 
why should he not? And that therefore the hobbit was captive there, driven 
to look in the glass for his torment by Saruman. That dark mind will be 
filled now with the voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it 
may take some time before he learns his error. We must snatch that time. We 
have been too leisurely. We must move. The neighbourhood of Isengard is no 
place now to linger in. I will ride ahead at once with Peregrin Took. It 
will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep.' 

'I will keep Jomer and ten Riders,' said the king. 'They shall ride 
with me at early day. The rest may go with Aragorn and ride as soon as they 
have a mind.' 

'As you will,' said Gandalf. 'But make all the speed you may to the 
cover of the hills, to Helm's Deep!' 

At that moment a shadow fell over them. The bright moonlight seemed to 
be suddenly cut off. Several of the Riders cried out, and crouched, holding 
their arms above their heads, as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind 
fear and a deadly cold fell on them. Cowering they looked up. A vast winged 
shape passed over the moon like a black cloud. It wheeled and went north, 
flying at a speed greater than any wind of Middle -earth. The stars fainted 
before it. It was gone. 

They stood up, rigid as stones. Gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and 
downwards, stiff, his hands clenched. 

'Nazgyl!' he cried. 'The messenger of Mordor. The storm is coming. The 
Nazgyl have crossed the River! Ride, ride! Wait not for the dawn! Let not 
the swift wait for the slow! Ride!' 

He sprang away, calling Shadowfax as he ran. Aragorn followed him. 
Going to Pippin, Gandalf picked him up in his arms. 'You shall come with me 
this time,' he said. 'Shadowfax shall show you his paces.' Then he ran to 
the place where he had slept. Shadowfax stood there already. Slinging the 
small bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders, the wizard leapt 
upon the horse's back. Aragorn lifted Pippin and set him in Gandalf s arms, 




, wrapped in cloak and blanket. 

’Farewell! Follow fast!' cried Gandalf. 'Away, Shadowfax!' 

The great horse tossed his head. His flowing tail flicked in the 
moonlight. Then he leapt forward, spurning the earth, and was gone like the 
north wind from the mountains. 

'A beautiful, restful night!' said Merry to Aragorn. 'Some folk have 
wonderful luck. He did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with Gandalf 
— and there he goes ! Instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand 
here for ever as a warning.' 

'If you had been the first to lift the Orthanc-stone, and not he, how 
would it be now?' said Aragorn. 'You might have done worse. Who can say? 
But 

now it is your luck to come with me, I fear. At once. Go and get ready, and 
bring anything that Pippin left behind. Make haste!' 

Over the plains Shadowfax was flying, needing no urging and no 
guidance. Less than an hour had passed, and they had reached the Fords of 
Isen and crossed them. The Mound of the Riders and its cold spears lay grey 
behind them. 

Pippin was recovering. He was warm, but the wind in his face was keen 
and refreshing. He was with Gandalf. The horror of the stone and of the 
hideous shadow over the moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of 
the mountains or in a passing dream. He drew a deep breath. 

'I did not know you rode bare-back, Gandalf,' he said. 'You haven't a 
saddle or a bridle!' 

'I do not ride elf-fashion, except on Shadowfax,' said Gandalf. 'But 
Shadowfax will have no harness. You do not ride Shadowfax: he is willing to 
carry you-or not. If he is willing, that is enough. It is then his business 
to see that you remain on his back, unless you jump off into the air.' 

'How fast is he going?' asked Pippin. 'Fast by the wind, but very 
smooth. And how light his footfalls are!' 

'He is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,' 
answered Gandalf; 'but that is not fast for him. The land is rising a little 
here, and is more broken than it was beyond the river. But see how the White 
Mountains are drawing near under the stars! Yonder are the Thrihyrne peaks 
like black spears. It will not be long before we reach the branching roads 
and come to the Deeping-coomb, where the battle was fought two nights ago.' 

Pippin was silent again for a while. He heard Gandalf singing softly to 




himself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran 
under them. At last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught 
the words: a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the 
wind: 

Tall ships and tall kings 

Three times three, 

What brought they from the foundered land 

Over the flowing sea? 

Seven stars and seven stones 

And one white tree. 

’What are you saying, Gandalf?' asked Pippin. 

'I was just running over some of the Rhymes of Lore in my mind ' 
answered the wizard. 'Hobbits, I suppose, have forgotten them, even those 
that they ever knew.' 

'No, not all,' said Pippin. 'And we have many of our own, which 
wouldn't interest you, perhaps. But I have never heard this one. What is it 
about — the seven stars and seven stones?' 

'About the palantnri of the Kings of Old,' said Gandalf. 

'And what are they?' 

'The name meant that which looks far away. The Orthanc-stone was one.' 

'Then it was not made, not made' — Pippin hesitated — 'by the Enemy?' 

'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor by Saruman. It is beyond his art, and beyond 
Sauron's too. The palantnri came from beyond Westernesse from Eldamar. 

The 

Noldor made them. Flanor himself, maybe, wrought them, in days so long ago 
that the time cannot be measured in years. But there is nothing that Sauron 
cannot turn to evil uses. Alas for Saruman! It was his downfall, as I now 
perceive. Perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we 
possess ourselves. Yet he must bear the blame. Fool! to keep it secret, for 
his own profit. No word did he ever speak of it to any of the Council. We 
had not yet given thought to the fate of the palantnri of Gondor in its 
ruinous wars. By Men they were almost forgotten. Even in Gondor they were a 
secret known only to a few; in Arnor they were remembered only in a rhyme of 
lore among the D®nedain.' 

'What did the Men of old use them for?' asked Pippin, delighted and 
astonished at getting answers to so many questions, and wondering how long 
it would last. 




To see far off, and to converse in thought with one another,' said 
Gandalf. 'In that way they long guarded and united the realm of Gondor. They 
set up Stones at Minas Anor, and at Minas Ithil, and at Orthanc in the ring 
of Isengard. The chief and master of these was under the Dome of Stars at 
Osgiliath before its ruin. The three others were far away in the North. In 
the house of Elrond it is told that they were at Ann®minas, and Amon Syl, 
and Elendil's Stone was on the Tower Hills that look towards Mithlond in the 
Gulf of Lune where the grey ships lie. 

'Each palantnr replied to each, but all those in Gondor were ever open 
to the view of Osgiliath. Now it appears that, as the rock of Orthanc has 
withstood the storms of time, so there the palantnr of that tower has 
remained. But alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far 
off and days remote. Very useful, no doubt, that was to Saruman; yet it 
seems that he was not content. Further and further abroad he gazed, until he 
cast his gaze upon Barad-dyr. Then he was caught! 

'Who knows where the lost Stones of Arnor and Gondor now lie buried, or 
drowned deep? But one. at least Sauron must have obtained and mastered to 
his purposes. I guess that it was the Ithil-stone, for he took Minas Ithil 
long ago and turned it into an evil place: Minas Morgul, it has become. 

'Easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of Saruman was 
trapped and held; and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar, and 
daunted when persuasion would not serve. The biter bit, the hawk under the 
eagle's foot, the spider in a steel web! How long, I wonder, has he been 
constrained to come often to his glass for inspection and instruction, and 
the Orthanc -stone so bent towards Barad-dyr that, if any save a will of 
adamant now looks into it, it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither? 

And how it draws one to itself! Have I not felt it? Even now my heart 
desires to test my will upon it, to see if I could not wrench it from him 
and turn it where I would-to look across the wide seas of water and of time 
to Tirion the Fair, and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Flanor at 
their work, while both the White Tree and the Golden were in flower!' He 
sighed and fell silent. 

'I wish I had known all this before,' said Pippin. 'I had no notion of 
what I was doing.' 

'Oh yes, you had,' said Gandalf. 'You knew you were behaving wrongly 
and foolishly; and you told yourself so, though you did not listen. I did 
not tell you all this before, because it is only by musing on all that has 




happened that I have at last understood, even as we ride together. But if I 
had spoken sooner, it would not have lessened your desire, or made it easier 
to resist. On the contrary! No, the burned hand teaches best. After that 
advice about fire goes to the heart.' 

'It does,' said Pippin. 'If all the seven stones were laid out before 
me now, I should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets.' 

'Good!' said Gandalf. 'That is what I hoped.' 

'But I should like to know—' Pippin began. 

'Mercy!' cried Gandalf. 'If the giving of information is to be the cure 
of your inquisitiveness, I shall spend all the rest of my days in answering 
you. What more do you want to know?' 

'The names of all the stars, and of all living things, and the whole 
history of Middle-earth and Over -heaven and of the Sundering Seas ' laughed 
Pippin. 'Of course! What less? But I am notin a hurry tonight. At the 
moment I was just wondering about the black shadow. I heard you shout 
"messenger of Mordor". What was it? What could it do at Isengard?' 

'It was a Black Rider on wings, a Nazgyl,' said Gandalf. 'It could have 
taken you away to the Dark Tower.' 

'But it was not coming for me, was it?' faltered Pippin. 'I mean, it 
didn't know that I had... ' 

'Of course not,' said Gandalf. 'It is two hundred leagues or more in 
straight flight from Barad-dyr to Orthanc, and even a Nazgyl would take a 
few hours to fly between them. But Saruman certainly looked in the Stone 
since the ore-raid, and more of his secret thought, I do not doubt, has been 
read than he intended. A messenger has been sent to find out what he is 
doing. And after what has happened tonight another will come, I think, and 
swiftly. So Saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put 
his hand in. He has no captive to send. He has no Stone to see with, and 
cannot answer the summons. Sauron will only believe that he is withholding 
the captive and refusing to use the Stone. It will not help Saruman to tell 
the truth to the messenger. For Isengard may be ruined, yet he is still safe 
in Orthanc. So whether he will or no, he will appear a rebel. Yet he 
rejected us, so as to avoid that very thing! What he will do in such a 
plight, I cannot guess. He has power still, I think, while in Orthanc, to 
resist the Nine Riders. He may try to do so. He may try to trap the Nazgyl, 
or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air. In that case 
let Rohan look to its horses ! 




'But I cannot tell how it will fall out, well or ill for us. It may be 
that the counsels of the Enemy will be confused, or hindered by his wrath 
with Saruman. It may be that he will learn that I was there and stood upon 
the stairs of Orthanc-with hobbits at my tail. Or that an heir of Elendil 
lives and stood beside me. If Wormtongue was not deceived by the armour of 
Rohan, he would remember Aragorn and the title that he claimed. That is what 
I fear. And so we fly — not from danger but into greater danger. Every 
stride of Shadowfax bears you nearer to the Land of Shadow, Peregrin Took.' 

Pippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had 
struck him. Grey land passed under them. 

'See now!' said Gandalf. 'The Westfold dales are opening before us. 

Here we come back to the eastward road. The dark shadow yonder is the 
mouth 

of the Deeping-coomb. That way lies Aglarond and the Glittering Caves. Do 
not ask me about them. Ask Gimli, if you meet again, and for the first time 
you may get an answer longer than you wish. You will not see the caves 
yourself, not on this journey. Soon they will be far behind.' 

'I thought you were going to stop at Helm's Deep!' said Pippin. 'Where 
are you going then?' 

'To Minas Tirith, before the seas of war surround it.' 

'Oh! And how far is that?' 

'Leagues upon leagues,' answered Gandalf. 'Thrice as far as the 
dwellings of King Thjoden, and they are more than a hundred miles east from 
here, as the messengers of Mordor fly. Shadowfax must run a longer road. 
Which will prove the swifter? 

'We shall ride now till daybreak, and that is some hours away. Then 
even Shadowfax must rest, in some hollow of the hills: at Edoras, I hope. 
Sleep, if you can! You may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden 
roof of the house of Eorl. And in two days thence you shall see the purple 
shadow of Mount Mindolluin and the walls of the tower of Denethor white in 
the morning. 

'Away now, Shadowfax! Run, greatheart, run as you have never run 
before! Now we are come to the lands where you were foaled and every stone 
you know. Run now! Hope is in speed!' 

Shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud, as if a trumpet had summoned 
him to battle. Then he sprang forward. Fire flew from his feet; night rushed 
over him. 




As he fell slowly into sleep, Pippin had a strange feeling: he and 
Gandalf were still as stone, seated upon the statue of a running horse, 
while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind. 




* BOOK IV * 



Chapter 1. The Taming of Smjagol 



'Well, master, we’re in a fix and no mistake,' said Sam Gamgee. He 
stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside Frodo, and peered out with 
puckered eyes into the gloom. 

It was the third evening since they had fled from the Company, as far 
as they could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which 
they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the 
Emyn 

Muil, sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way 
forward, sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to 
where they had been hours before. Yet on the whole they had worked steadily 
eastward, keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this 
strange twisted knot of hills. But always they found its outward faces 
sheer, high and impassable, frowning over the plain below; beyond its 
tumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even 
a bird was to be seen. 

The hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff, bare and bleak, its 
feet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with 
drifting cloud. A chill wind' blew from the East. Night was gathering over 
the shapeless lands before them; the sickly green of them was fading to a 
sullen brown. Far away to the right the Anduin, that had gleamed fitfully in 
sun-breaks during the day, was now hidden in shadow. But their eyes did not 
look beyond the River, back to Gondor, to their friends, to the lands of 
Men. South and east they stared to where, at the edge of the oncoming night, 
a dark line hung, like distant mountains of motionless smoke. Every now and 
again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of earth and 
sky. 

'What a fix! ' said Sam. 'That's the one place in all the lands we've 
ever heard of that we don't want to see any closer; and that's the one place 
we're trying to get to! And that's just where we can't get, nohow. We've 
come the wrong way altogether, seemingly. We can't get down; and if we did 




get down, we’d find all that green land a nasty bog, I'll warrant. Phew! Can 
you smell it?' He sniffed at the wind. 

’Yes, I can smell it,' said Frodo, but he did not move, and his eyes 
remained fixed, staring out towards the dark line and the flickering flame. 
'Mordor! ' he muttered under his breath. 'If I must go there I wish I could 
come there quickly and make an end! ' He shuddered. The wind was chilly and 
yet heavy with an odour of cold decay. 'Well,' he said, at last withdrawing 
his eyes, 'we cannot stay here all night, fix or no fix. We must find a more 
sheltered spot, and camp once more; and perhaps another day will show us a 
path.’ 

'Or another and another and another,' muttered Sam. 'Or maybe no day. 
We've come the wrong way.' 

'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'It's my doom, I think, to go to that Shadow 
yonder, so that a way will be found. But will good or evil show it to me? 

What hope we had was in speed. Delay plays into the Enemy's hands-and here I 
am: delayed. Is it the will of the Dark Tower that steers us? All my choices 
have proved ill. I should have left the Company long before, and come down 
from the North, east of the River and of the Emyn Muil, and so over the hard 
of Battle Plain to the passes of Mordor. But now it isn't possible for you 
and me alone to find a way back, and the Ores are prowling on the east bank. 
Every day that passes is a precious day lost. I am tired, Sam. I don't know 
what is to be done. What food have we got left?' 

'Only those, what d'you call 'em, lembas, Mr. Frodo. A fair supply. But 
they are better than naught, by a long bite. I never thought, though, when I 
first set tooth in them, that I should ever come to wish for a change. But I 
do now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug — aye, half a mug — of beer would 
go down proper. I've lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last camp, 
and what use has it been? Naught to make a fire with, for a start; and 
naught to cook, not even grass!' 

They turned away and went down into a stony hollow. The westering sun 
was caught into clouds, and night came swiftly. They slept as well as they 
could for the cold, turn and turn about, in a nook among great jagged 
pinnacles of weathered rock; at least they were sheltered from the easterly 
wind. 

'Did you see them again, Mr. Frodo?’ asked Sam, as they sat, stiff and 
chilled, munching wafers of lembas , in the cold grey of early morning. 

'No,' said Frodo. 'I've heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two nights 




now.' 

'Nor me,' said Sam. 'Grrr! Those eyes did give me a turn! But perhaps 
we've shaken him off at last, the miserable slinker. Gollum! I'll give him 
gollum in his throat, if ever I get my hands on his neck.' 

'I hope you'll never need to,' said Frodo. 'I don't know how he 
followed us; but it may be that he's lost us again, as you say. In this dry 
bleak land we can't leave many footprints, nor much scent, even for his 
snuffling nose.' 

'I hope that's the way of it,' said Sam. 'I wish we could be rid of him 
for good!' 

'So do I,' said Frodo; 'but he's not my chief trouble. I wish we could 
get away from these hills ! I hate them. I feel all naked on the east side, 
stuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that Shadow 
yonder. There's an Eye in it. Come on! We've got to get down today somehow.' 

But that day wore on, and when afternoon faded towards evening they 
were still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape. 

Sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they 
heard faint sounds behind them, a stone falling, or the imagined step of 
flapping feet on the rock. But if they halted and stood still listening, 
they heard no more, nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the 
stones — yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp 
teeth. 

All that day the outer ridge of the Emyn Muil had been bending 
gradually northward, as they struggled on. Along its brink there now 
stretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock, cut every now 
and again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in 
the cliff-face. To find a path in these clefts, which were becoming deeper 
and more frequent, Frodo and Sam were driven to their left, well away from 
the edge, and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going 
slowly but steadily downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of 
the lowlands. 

At last they were brought to a halt. The ridge took a sharper bend 
northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine. On the further side it reared 
up again, many fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before 
them, cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke. They could go no further 
forwards, and must turn now either west or east. But west would lead them 
only into more labour and delay, back towards the heart of the hills; east 




would take them to the outer precipice. 

'There's nothing for it but to scramble down this gully, Sam,' said 
Frodo. 'Let's see what it leads to!' 

'A nasty drop, I'll bet,' said Sam. 

The cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed. Some way down they 
found a few gnarled and stunted trees, the first they had seen for days: 
twisted birch for the most part, with here and there a fir-tree. Many were 
dead and gaunt, bitten to the core by the eastern winds. Once in milder days 
there must have been a fair thicket in the ravine, but now, after some fifty 
yards, the trees came to an end, though old broken stumps straggled on 
almost to the cliffs brink. The bottom of the gully, which lay along the 
edge of a rock-fault, was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down. 
When they came at last to the end of it, Frodo stooped and leaned out. 

'Look!' he said. 'We must have come down a long way, or else the cliff 
has sunk. It's much lower here than it was, and it looks easier too.' 

Sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge. Then he 
glanced up at the great cliff rising up, away on their left. 'Easier! ’ he 
grunted. 'Well, I suppose it's always easier getting down than up. Those as 
can't fly can jump!' 

'It would be a big jump still,’ said Frodo. 'About, well' — he stood 
for a moment measuring it with his eyes — 'about eighteen fathoms I should 
guess. Not more.’ 

'And that's enough! ' said Sam. 'Ugh! How I do hate looking down from a 
height! But looking's better than climbing.' 

'All the same,' said Frodo, 'I think we could climb here; and I think 
we shall have to try. See — the rock is quite different from what it was a 
few miles back. It has slipped and cracked.' 

The outer fall was indeed no longer sheer, but sloped outwards a 
little. It looked like a great rampart or sea-wall whose foundations had 
shifted, so that its courses were all twisted and disordered, leaving great 
fissures and long slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as 
stairs. 

'And if we're going to try and get down, we had better try at once. 

It's getting dark early. I think there's a storm coming.' 

The smoky blur of the mountains in the East was lost in a deeper 
blackness that was already reaching out westwards with long arms. There was 
a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze. Frodo sniffed the 




air and looked up doubtfully at the sky. He strapped his belt outside his 
cloak and tightened it, and settled his light pack on his back; then he 
stepped towards the edge. 'I'm going to try it,' he said. 

'Very good! ' said Sam gloomily. 'But I'm going first.' 

'You? ' said Frodo. 'What's made you change your mind about climbing?' 

'I haven't changed my mind. But it's only sense: put the one lowest as 
is most likely to slip. I don't want to come down atop of you and knock you 
off no sense in killing two with one fall.' 

Before Frodo could stop him, he sat down, swung his legs over the 
brink, and twisted round, scrabbling with his toes for a foothold. It is 
doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood, or more unwise. 

'No, no! Sam, you old ass! ' said Frodo. 'You'll kill yourself for 
certain going over like that without even a look to see what to make for. 
Come back! ' He took Sam under the armpits and hauled him up again. 'Now, 
wait a bit and be patient! ' he said. Then he lay on the ground, leaning out 
and looking down: but the light seemed to be fading quickly, although the 
sun had not yet set. 'I think we could manage this,' he said presently. 'I 
could at any rate; and you could too. if you kept your head and followed me 
carefully.' 

'I don't know how you can be so sure,' said Sam. 'Why! You can't see to 
the bottom in this light. What if you comes to a place where there's nowhere 
to put your feet or your hands?' 

'Climb back, I suppose,' said Frodo. 

'Easy said,' objected Sam. 'Better wait till morning and more light.' 

'No! Not if I can help it,' said Frodo with a sudden strange vehemence. 

I grudge every hour, every minute. I'm going down to try it out. Don't you 
follow till I come back or call!' 

Gripping the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he let himself 
gently down, until when his arms were almost at full stretch, his toes found 
a ledge. 'On_ e step down! ' he said. 'And this ledge broadens out to the 
right. I could stand there without a hold. I'll—' his words were cut short. 

The hurrying darkness, now gathering great speed, rushed up from the 
East and swallowed the sky. There was a dry splitting crack of thunder right 
overhead. Searing lightning smote down into the hills. Then came a blast of 
savage wind, and with it, mingling with its roar, there came a high shrill 
shriek. The hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the Marish as they 
fled from Hobbiton, and even there in the woods of the Shire it had frozen 




their blood. Out here in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced 
them with cold blades of horror and despair, stopping heart and breath. Sam 
fell flat on his face. Involuntarily Frodo loosed his hold and put his hands 
over his head and ears. He swayed, slipped, and slithered downwards with a 
wailing cry. 

Sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge. 'Master, master! 

' he called. ’Master!'. 

He heard no answer. He found he was shaking all over, but he gathered 
his breath, and once again he shouted: 'Master!' The wind seemed to blow his 
voice back into his throat, but as it passed, roaring up the gully and away 
over the hills, a faint answering cry came to his ears: 

'All right, all right! I'm here. But I can't see.' 

Frodo was calling with a weak voice. ,He was not actually very far 
away. He had slid and not fallen, and had come up with a jolt to his feet on 
a wider ledge not many yards lower down. Fortunately the rock-face at this 
point leaned well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff, so 
that he had not toppled over. He steadied himself a little, laying his face 
against the cold stone, feeling his heart pounding. But either the darkness 
had grown complete, or else his eyes had lost their sight. All was black 
about him. He wondered if he had been struck blind. He took a deep breath. 

'Come back! Come back! ' he heard Sam's voice out of the blackness 
above. 

'I can't,’ he said. 'I can't see. I can't find any hold. I can't move 
yet.' 

'What can I do, Mr. Frodo? What can I do? ’ shouted Sam, leaning out 
dangerously far. Why could not his master see? It was dim, certainly, but 
not as dark as all that. He could see Frodo below him, a grey forlorn figure 
splayed against the cliff. But he was far out of the reach of any helping 
hand. 

There was another crack of thunder; and then the rain came. In a 
blinding sheet, mingled with hail, it drove against the cliff, bitter cold. 

Tm coming down to you,' shouted Sam, though how he hoped to help in 
that way he could not have said. 

'No, no! wait! 'Frodo called back, more strongly now. 'I shall be 
better soon. I feel better already. Wait! You can't do anything without a 
rope.' 

'Rope!' cried Sam, talking wildly to himself in his excitement and 




relief. 'Well, if I don’t deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning 
to numbskulls! You're nowt but a ninnyhammer, Sam Gamgee: that's what 
the 

Gaffer said to me often enough, it being a word of his. Rope!' 

'Stop chattering!’ cried Frodo, now recovered enough to feel both 
amused and annoyed. ’Never mind your Gaffer! Are you trying to tell yourself 
you've got some rope in your pocket? If so, out with it! 

'Yes, Mr. Frodo, in my pack and all. Carried it hundreds of miles and 
I'd clean forgotten it!' 

'Then get busy and let an end down!’ 

Quickly Sam unslung his pack and rummaged in it. There indeed at the 
bottom was a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of Lurien. He 
cast an end to his master. The darkness seemed to lift from Frodo's eyes, or 
else his sight was returning. He could see the grey line as it came dangling 
down, and he thought it had a faint silver sheen. Now that he had some point 
in the darkness to fix his eyes on, he felt less giddy. Leaning his weight 
forward, he made the end fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line 
with both hands. 

Sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from 
the edge. Half hauled, half scrambling. Frodo came up and threw himself on 
the ground. 

Thunder growled and rumbled in the distance, and the rain was still 
falling heavily. The hobbits crawled away back into the gully; but they did 
not find much shelter there. Rills of water began to run down; soon they 
grew to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stones, and spouted out over 
the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof. 

'I should have been half drowned down there, or washed clean off,' said 
Frodo. 'What a piece of luck you had that rope!' 

'Better luck if I'd thought of it sooner,' said Sam. 'Maybe you 
remember them putting the ropes in the boats, as we started off: in the 
elvish country. I took a fancy to it, and I stowed a coil in my pack. Years 
ago, it seems. "It may be a help in many needs," he said: Haldir, or one of 
those folk. And he spoke right.' 

'A pity I didn't think of bringing another length,' said Frodo; 'but I 
left the Company in such a hurry and confusion. If only we had enough we 
could use it to get down. How long is your rope, I wonder?’ 

Sam paid it out slowly, measuring it with his arms: 'Five, ten, twenty, 




thirty ells, more or less,' he said. 

'Who'd have thought it!' Frodo exclaimed. 

'Ah! Who would? ' said Sam. 'Elves are wonderful folk. It looks a bit 
thin, but it's tough; and soft as milk to the hand. Packs close too, and as 
light as light. Wonderful folk to be sure!' 

'Thirty ells! ' said Frodo considering. 'I believe it would be enough. 

If the storm passes before nightfall, I'm going to try it.' 

'The rain's nearly given over already,' said Sam; 'but don't you go 
doing anything risky in the dim again, Mr. Frodo! And I haven't got over 
that shriek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a Black Rider it sounded-but 
one up in the air, if they can fly. I'm thinking we'd best lay up in this 
crack till night's over.' 

'And I'm thinking that I won't spend a moment longer than I need stuck 
up on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking over the marshes,' 
said Frodo. 

With that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again. 

He looked out. Clear sky was growing in the East once more. The skirts of 
the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to 
spread its great wings over the Emyn Muil; upon which the dark thought of 
Sauron brooded for a while. Thence it turned, smiting the Vale of Anduin 
with hail and lightning, and casting its shadow upon Minas Tirith with 
threat of war. Then, lowering in the mountains, and gathering its great 
spires, it rolled on slowly over Gondor and the skirts of Rohan, until far 
away the Riders on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the sun, as 
they rode into the West. But here, over the desert and the reeking marshes 
the deep blue sky of evening opened once more, and a few pallid stars 
appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent moon. 

'It's good to be able to see again,' said Frodo, breathing deep. 'Do 
you know, I thought for a bit that I had lost my sight? From the lightning 
or something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey 
rope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow.' 

'It does look sort of silver in the dark,' said Sam. 'Never noticed it 
before, though I can't remember as I've ever had it out since I first stowed 
it. But if you're so set on climbing, Mr. Frodo, how are you going to use 
it? Thirty ells, or say, about eighteen fathom: that's no more than your 
guess at the height of the cliff.' 

Frodo thought for a while. 'Make it fast to that stump, Sam! ’ he said. 




'Then I think you shall have your wish this time and go first. I'll lower 
you, and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself 
off the rock. Though, if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give 
me a rest, it will help. When you're down, I'll follow. I feel quite myself 
again now.' 

'Very well,' said Sam heavily. 'If it must be, let's get it over! ' He 
took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink; then 
the other end he tied about his own waist. Reluctantly he turned and 
prepared to go over the edge a second time. 

It did not, however, turn out half as bad as he had expected. The rope 
seemed to give him confidence, though he shut his eyes more than once when 
he looked down between his feet. There was one awkward spot, where there 
was 

no ledge and the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space; there 
he slipped and swung out on the silver line. But Frodo lowered him slowly 
and steadily, and it was over at last. His chief fear had been that the 
rope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a 
good bight in Frodo's hands, when Sam came to the bottom and called up: 'I'm 
down! ' His voice came up clearly from below, but Frodo could not see him; 
his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight. 

Frodo took rather more time to follow him. He had the rope about his 
waist and it was fast above, and he had shortened it so that it would pull 
him up before he reached the ground; still he did not want to risk a fall, 
and he had not quite Sam's faith in this slender grey line. He found two 
places, all the same, where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces 
where there was no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges 
were far apart. But at last he too was down. 

'Well!' he cried. 'We've done it! We've escaped from the Emyn Muil! And 
now what next, I wonder? Maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock 
under foot again.' 

But Sam did not answer: he was staring back up the cliff. 

'Ninny hammers! ' he said. 'Noodles! My beautiful rope! There it is tied to a 
stump, and we're at the bottom. Just as nice a little stair for that 
slinking Gollum as we could leave. Better put up a signpost to say which way 
we've gone! I thought it seemed a bit too easy.' 

'If you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet 
brought it down with us, then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer, or any 




other name your Gaffer gave you,' said Frodo. 'Climb up and untie it and let 
yourself down, if you want to!' 

Sam scratched his head. 'No, I can't think how, begging your pardon,' 
he said. 'But I don't like leaving it, and that's a fact.' He stroked the 
rope's end and shook it gently. 'It goes hard parting with anything I 
brought out of the Elf-country. Made by Galadriel herself, too, maybe. 
Galadriel,' he murmured nodding his head mournfully. He looked up and gave 
one last pull to the rope as if in farewell. 

To the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose. Sam fell 
over, and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top of him. Frodo 
laughed. 'Who tied the rope? ' he said. 'A good thing it held as long as it 
did! To think that I trusted all my weight to your knot!’ 

Sam did not laugh. 'I may not be much good at climbing, Mr. Frodo,' he 
said in injured tones, 'but I do know something about rope and about knots. 

It's in the family, as you might say. Why, my grand-dad, and my uncle Andy 
after him, him that was the Gaffer's eldest brother he had a rope-walk over 
by Tighfield many a year. And I put as fast a hitch over the stump as any 
one could have done, in the Shire or out of it.' 

'Then the rope must have broken — frayed on the rock-edge, I expect,' 
said Frodo. 

'I bet it didn't! ' said Sam in an even more injured voice. He stooped 
and examined the ends. 'Nor it hasn't neither. Not a strand!' 

'Then I'm afraid it must have been the knot,' said Frodo. 

Sam shook his head and did not answer. He was passing the rope through 
his fingers thoughtfully. 'Have it your own way, Mr. Frodo,' he said at 
last, 'but I think the rope came off itself — when I called.' He coiled it 
up and stowed it lovingly in his pack. 

'It certainly came,' said Frodo, 'and that's the chief thing. But now 
we've got to think of our next move. Night will be on us soon. How beautiful 
the stars are, and the Moon!' 

'They do cheer the heart, don't they? ' said Sam looking up. 'Elvish 
they are. somehow. And the Moon's growing. We haven't seen him for a night 
or two in this cloudy weather. He's beginning to give quite a light.' 

'Yes,' said Frodo; 'but he won't be full for some days. I don't think 
we'll try the marshes by the light of half a moon.' 

Under the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of 
their journey. After a while Sam turned and looked back at the way they had 




come. The mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff. Tm glad 
we’ve got the rope,' he said. 'We’ve set a little puzzle for that footpad, 
anyhow. He can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges!' 

They picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff, among a 
wilderness of boulders and rough stones, wet and slippery with the heavy 
rain. The ground still fell away sharply. They had not gone very far when 
they came upon a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet. 
It was not wide, but it was too wide to jump across in the dim light. They 
thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths. It curved away on 
their left northward, back towards the hills, and so barred their road in 
that direction, at any rate while darkness lasted. 

'We had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff, I 
think,' said Sam. 'We might find some nook there, or even a cave or 
something.' 

'I suppose so,' said Frodo. Tm tired, and I don't think I can 
scramble among stones much longer tonight — though I grudge the delay. I 
wish there was a clear path in front of us: then I'd go on till my legs gave 
way.' 

They did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the Emyn 
Muil. Nor did Sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only bare stony 
slopes frowned over by the cliff, which now rose again, higher and more 
sheer as they went back. In the end, worn out, they just cast themselves on 
the ground under the lee of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the 
precipice. There for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the 
cold stony night, while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do 
to hold it off. The moon now rode high and clear. Its thin white light lit 
up the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff, 
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale grey scored with 
black shadows. 

'Well! ' said Frodo, standing up and drawing his cloak more closely 
round him. 'You sleep for a bit Sam and take my blanket. I'll walk up and 
down on sentry for a while.' Suddenly he stiffened, and stooping he gripped 
Sam by the arm. 'What's that? ' he whispered. 'Look over there on the 
cliff!’ 

Sam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth. 'Ssss!' he said. 
'That's what it is. It's that Gollum! Snakes and adders! And to think that I 
thought that we'd puzzle him with our bit of a climb! Look at him! Like a 




nasty crawling spider on a wall.' 

Down the face of a precipice, sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the 
pale moonlight, a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed 
out. Maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices and holds 
that no hobbit could ever have seen or used, but it looked as if it was just 
creeping down on sticky pads, like some large prowling thing of insect-kind. 
And it was coming down head first, as if it was smelling its way. Now and 
again it lifted its head slowly, turning it right back on its long skinny 
neck, and the hobbits caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights, 
its eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded 
again. 

'Do you think he can see us? ' said Sam. 

'I don't know,' said Frodo quietly, 'but I think not. It is hard even 
for friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: I cannot see you in the shadow 
even at a few paces. And I've heard that he doesn’t like Sun or Moon.' 

'Then why is he coming down just here? ’ asked Sam. 

'Quietly, Sam! ' said Frodo. 'He can smell us, perhaps. And he can hear 
as keen as Elves, I believe. I think he has heard something now: our voices 
probably. We did a lot of shouting away back there; and we were talking far 
too loudly until a minute ago.' 

'Well, I'm sick of him,' said Sam. 'He's come once too often for me and 
I'm going to have a word with him, if I can. I don't suppose we could give 
him the slip now anyway.' Drawing his grey hood well over his face, Sam 
crept stealthily towards the cliff. 

'Careful!' whispered Frodo coming behind. 'Don't alarm him! He's much 
more dangerous than he looks.' 

The black crawling shape was now three-quarters of the way down, and 
perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliffs foot. Crouching stone-still in 
the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him. He seemed to have 
come to a difficult passage or to be troubled about something. They could 
hear him snuffling, and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that 
sounded like a curse. He lifted his head, and they thought they heard him 
spit. Then he moved on again. Now they could hear his voice creaking and 
whistling. 

'Ach, sss! Cautious, my precious! More haste less speed. We musstn't 
rissk our neck, musst we, precious? No, precious — golluml' He lifted his 
head again, blinked at the moon, and quickly shut his eyes. 'We hate it,' he 




hissed. 'Nassty, nassty shivery light it is — sss — it spies on us, 
precious — it hurts our eyes.' 

He was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer. 
'Where iss it, where iss it: my Precious, my Precious? It's ours, it is, and 
we wants it. The thieves, the thieves, the filthy little thieves. Where are 
they with my Precious? Curse them! We hates them.' 

'It doesn't sound as if he knew we were here, does it? ' whispered Sam. 
'And what's his Precious? Does he mean the' 

'Hsh! ' breathed Frodo. 'He's getting near now, near enough to hear a 
whisper.' 

Indeed Gollum had suddenly paused again, and his large head on its 
scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening. His pale 
eyes were half unlidded. Sam restrained himself, though his fingers were 
twitching. His eyes, filled with anger and disgust, were fixed on the 
wretched creature as he now began to move again, still whispering and 
hissing to himself. 

At last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground, right above 
their heads. From that point there was a sheer drop, for the cliff was 
slightly undercut, and even Gollum could not find a hold of any kind. He 
seemed to be trying to twist round, so as to go legs first, when suddenly 
with a shrill whistling shriek he fell. As he did so, he curled his legs and 
arms up round him, like a spider whose descending thread is snapped. 

Sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him 
and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps. Before Gollum could get up, he was 
on top of him. But he found Gollum more than he bargained for, even taken 
like that, suddenly, off his guard after a fall. Before Sam could get a 
hold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a 
clinging grip, soft but horribly strong, was squeezing him like slowly 
tightening cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat. Then sharp 
teeth bit into his shoulder. All he could do was to butt his hard round head 
sideways into the creature's face. Gollum hissed and spat, but he did not 
let go. 

Things would have gone ill with Sam, if he had been alone. But Frodo 
sprang up, and drew Sting from its sheath. With his left hand he drew back 
Gollum's head by his thin lank hair, stretching his long neck, and forcing 
his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky. 

'Let go! Gollum,' he said. 'This is Sting. You have seen it before once 




upon a time. Let go, or you'll feel it this time! I'll cut your throat.' 

Gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string. Sam got up, fingering 
his shoulder. His eyes smouldered with anger, but he could not avenge 
himself: his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering. 

'Don't hurt us! Don't let them hurt us, precious! They won't hurt us 
will they, nice little hobbitses? We didn't mean no harm, but they jumps on 
us like cats on poor mices, they did, precious. And we're so lonely, gollum. 
We'll be nice to them, very nice, if they'll be nice to us, won't we, yes, 
yess.' 

'Well, what’s to be done with it? ' said Sam. 'Tie it up, so as it 
can't come sneaking after us no more, I say.' 

'But that would kill us, kill us,' whimpered Gollum. 'Cruel little 
hobbitses. Tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us, gollum, gollum.' 
Sobs welled up in his gobbling throat. 

'No,' said Frodo. 'If we kill him, we must kill him outright. But we 
can't do that, not as things are. Poor wretch! He has done us no harm.' 

'Oh hasn't he! ' said Sam rubbing his shoulder. 'Anyway he meant to, 
and he means to, I'll warrant. Throttle us in our sleep, that's his plan.' 

'I daresay,' said Frodo. 'But what he means to do is another matter.' 

He paused for a while in thought. Gollum lay still, but stopped whimpering. 
Sam stood glowering over him. 

It seemed to Frodo then that he heard, quite plainly but far off, 
voices out of the past: 

What a pity Bilbo did not stub the vile creature, when he had a chance! 

Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike 
without need. 

I do not feel any pity for Gollum. He deserves death. 

Deserves death! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And 
some die that deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too eager 
to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even 
the wise cannot see all ends. 

'Very well,’ he answered aloud, lowering his sword. 'But still I am 
afraid. And yet, as you see, I will not touch the creature. For now that I 
see him, I do pity him.' 

Sam stared at his master, who seemed to be speaking to some one who was 
not there. Gollum lifted his head. 

'Yess, wretched we are, precious,' he whined. 'Misery misery! Hobbits 




won't kill us, nice hobbits.' 

'No, we won't,' said Frodo. 'But we won't let you go, either. You're 
full of wickedness and mischief, Gollum. You will have to come with us, 
that's all, while we keep an eye on you. But you must help us, if you can. 

One good turn deserves another.' 

'Yess, yes indeed,' said Gollum sitting up. 'Nice hobbits! We will come 
with them. Find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. And where are they 
going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we wonders? ' He looked up 
at them, and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second 
in his pale blinking eyes. 

Sam scowled at him, and sucked his teeth; but he seemed to sense that 
there was something odd about his master's mood and that the matter was 
beyond argument. All the same he was amazed at Frodo's reply. 

Frodo looked straight into Gollum's eyes which flinched and twisted 
away. 'You know that, or you guess well enough, Smjagol,' he said, quietly 
and sternly. 'We are going to Mordor, of course. And you know the way there, 
I believe.' 

'Ach! sss! ' said Gollum, covering his ears with his hands, as if such 
frankness, and the open speaking of the names, hurt him. 'We guessed, yes we 
guessed,' he whispered; 'and we didn't want them to go, did we? No, 
precious, not the nice hobbits. Ashes, ashes, and dust, and thirst there is; 
and pits, pits, pits, and Ores, thousands of Orcses. Nice hobbits mustn't go 
to — sss — those places.' 

'So you have been there? ' Frodo insisted. 'And you're being drawn back 
there, aren't you?' 

'Yess. Yess. No! ' shrieked Gollum. 'Once, by accident it was, wasn't 
it, precious? Yes, by accident. But we won't go back, no, no!' Then suddenly 
his voice and language changed, and he sobbed in his throat, and spoke but 
not to them. 'Leave me alone, golluml You hurt me. O my poor hands, gollum 
I, we, I don't want to come back. I can't find it. I am tired. I, we can't 
find it, gollum, gollum, no, nowhere. They're always awake. Dwarves, Men, 
and Elves, terrible Elves with bright eyes. I can't find it. Ach! ' He got 
up and clenched his long hand into a bony fleshless knot, shaking it towards 
the East. 'We won't! ' he cried. 'Not for you.' Then he collapsed again. 
'Gollum, gollum,' he whimpered with his face to the ground. 'Don't look at 
us! Go away! Go to sleep!' 

'He will not go away or go to sleep at your command, Smjagol,' said 




Frodo. 'But if you really wish to be free of him again, then you must help 
me. And that I fear means finding us a path towards him. But you need not go 
all the way, not beyond the gates of his land.' 

Gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids. 'He's over 
there,' he cackled. 'Always there. Ores will take you all the way. Easy to 
find Ores east of the River. Don't ask Smjagol. Poor, poor Smjagol, he went 
away long ago. They took his Precious, and he's lost now.' 

'Perhaps we'll find him again, if you come with us,' said Frodo. 

'No, no, never! He's lost his Precious,' said Gollum. 

'Get up! ' said Frodo. 

Gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff. 

'Now! ’ said Frodo. 'Can you find a path easier by day or by night? 

We're tired; but if you choose the night, we'll start tonight.' 

'The big lights hurt our eyes, they do,’ Gollum whined. 'Not under the 
White Face, not yet. It will go behind the hills soon, yess. Rest a bit 
first, nice hobbits!’ 

'Then sit down,' said Frodo, 'and don't move!' 

The hobbits seated themselves beside him, one on either side, with 
their backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. There was no need for any 
arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. Slowly 
the moon went by. Shadows fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before 
them. The stars grew thick and bright in the sky above. No one stirred. 
Gollum sat with his legs drawn up, knees under chin, flat hands and feet 
splayed on the ground, his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking 
or listening. 

Frodo looked across at Sam. Their eyes met and they understood. They 
relaxed, leaning their heads back, and shutting their eyes or seeming to. 

Soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard. Gollum's hands 
twitched a little. Hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the 
right, and first one eye and then the other opened a slit. The hobbits made 
no sign. 

Suddenly, with startling agility and speed, straight off the ground 
with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog. Gollum bounded forward into the 
darkness. But that was just what Frodo and Sam had expected. Sam was on 
him 

before he had gone two paces after his spring. Frodo coming behind grabbed 
his leg and threw him. 




'Your rope might prove useful again, Sam.' he said. 

Sam got out the rope. 'And where were you off to in the cold hard 
lands, Mr. Gollum?' he growled. 'We wonders, aye, we wonders. To find 
some 

of your ore-friends, I warrant. You nasty treacherous creature. It's round 
your neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.' 

Gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks. He did not answer Sam, 
but gave him a swift venomous look. 

'All we need is something to keep a hold on him,' said Frodo. 'We want 
him to walk, so it's no good tying his legs-or his arms, he seems to use 
them nearly as much. Tie one end to his ankle, and keep a grip on the other 
end.' 

He stood over Gollum, while Sam tied the knot. The result surprised 
them both. Gollum began to scream, a thin, tearing sound, very horrible to 
hear. He writhed, and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope. 

He kept on screaming. 

At last Frodo was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could 
not be from the knot. He examined it and found that it was not too tight, 
indeed hardly tight enough. Sam was gentler than his words. 'What's the 
matter with you? ' he said. 'If you will try to run away, you must be tied; 
but we don't wish to hurt you.' 

'It hurts us, it hurts us,' hissed Gollum. 'It freezes, it bites! Elves 
twisted it, curse them! Nasty cruel hobbits! That's why we tries to escape, 
of course it is, precious. We guessed they were cruel hobbits. They visits 
Elves, fierce Elves with bright eyes. Take it off us! It hurts us.' 

'No, I will not take it off you,’ said Frodo, 'not unless' — he paused 
a moment in thought — 'not unless there is any promise you can make that I 
can trust.' 

'We will swear to do what he wants, yes, yess, said Gollum, still 
twisting and grabbling at his ankle. 'It hurts us.' 

'Swear? ’ said Frodo. 

'Smjagol,' said Gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and 
staring at Frodo with a strange light. 'Smjagol will swear on the Precious.' 

Frodo drew himself up, and again Sam was startled by his words and his 
stern voice. 'On the Precious? How dare you? ' he said. 'Think! 

One Ring to rule them all and in the Darkness bind them. 

Would you commit your promise to that, Smjagol? It will hold you. But 




it is more treacherous than you are. It may twist your words. Beware!' 

Gollum cowered. 'On the Precious, on the Precious! ' he repeated. 

'And what would you swear? ' asked Frodo. 

'To be very very good,' said Gollum. Then crawling to Frodo's feet he 
grovelled before him, whispering hoarsely: a shudder ran over him, as if the 
words shook his very bones with fear. 'Smjagol will swear never, never, to 
let Him have it. Never! Smjagol will save it. But he must swear on the 
Precious.' 

'No! not on it,' said Frodo, looking down at him with stern pity. 'All 
you wish is to see it and touch it, if you can, though you know it would 
drive you mad. Not on it. Swear by it, if you will. For you know where it 
is. Yes, you know, Smjagol. It is before you.' 

For a moment it appeared to Sam that his master had grown and Gollum 
had shrunk: a tall stern shadow, a mighty lord who hid his brightness in 
grey cloud, and at his feet a little whining dog. Yet the two were in some 
way akin and not alien: they could reach one another's minds. Gollum raised 
himself and began pawing at Frodo, fawning at his knees. 

'Down! down! ' said Frodo. 'Now speak your promise!’ 

'We promises, yes I promise!’ said Gollum. ’I will serve the master of 
the Precious. Good master, good Smjagol, gollum, gollumY Suddenly he began 
to weep and bite at his ankle again. 

'Take the rope off, Sam!' said Frodo. 

Reluctantly Sam obeyed. At once Gollum got up and began prancing about, 
like a whipped cur whose master has patted it. From that moment a change, 
which lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and 
whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He 
would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden 
movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was 
friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with 
laughter and caper, if any jest was made, or even if Frodo spoke kindly to 
him, and weep if Frodo rebuked him. Sam said little to him of any sort. He 
suspected him more deeply than ever, and if possible liked the new Gollum, 
the Smjagol, less than the old. 

'Well, Gollum, or whatever it is we're to call you,' he said, 'now for 
it! The Moon's gone, and the night's going. We'd better start.' 

'Yes, yes,' agreed Gollum, skipping about. 'Off we go! There's only one 
way across between the North-end and the South-end. I found it, I did. Ores 




don’t use it, Ores don't know it. Ores don’t cross the Marshes, they go 
round for miles and miles. Very lucky you came this way. Very lucky you 
found Smjagol, yes. Follow Smjagol!' 

He took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly, like a dog 
inviting them for a walk. 'Wait a bit, Gollum!' cried Sam. 'Not too far 
ahead now! I'm going to be at your tail, and I've got the rope handy.' 

'No, no! ' said Gollum. 'Smjagol promised.' 

In the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off. Gollum led 
them back northward for a while along the way they had come; then he slanted 
to the right away from the steep edge of the Emyn Muil, down the broken 
stony slopes towards the vast fens below. They faded swiftly and softly into 
the darkness. Over all the leagues of waste before the gates of Mordor there 
was a black silence. 




Chapter 2 . The Passage of the Marshes 



Gollum moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, often 
using his hands as well as his feet. Frodo and Sam were hard put to it to 
keep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, 
and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. After a time he 
brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before; 
but they were now further from the hills. 

'Here it is!' he cried. 'There is a way down inside, yes. Now we 
follows it — out, out away over there.' He pointed south and east towards 
the marshes. The reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in 
the cool night air. . 

Gollum cast up and down along the brink, and at length he called to 
them. 'Here! We can get down here. Smjagol went this way once: I went this 
way, hiding from Ores.' 

He led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into the 
gloom. It was not difficult, for the rift was at this point only some 
fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across. There was running water at the 
bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled 
down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond. Gollum 
turned to the right, southward more or less, and splashed along with his 
feet in the shallow stony stream. He seemed greatly delighted to feel the 
water, and chuckled to himself, sometimes even croaking in a sort of song. 

The cold hard lands, 
they bites our hands, 
they gnaws our feet. 

The rocks and stones 
are like old bones 
all bare of meat. 

But stream and pool 
is wet and cool: 
so nice for feet! 

And now we wish — 

'Ha! ha! What does we wish?' he said, looking sidelong at the hobbits. 
'We'll tell you.' he croaked. 'He guessed it long ago, Baggins guessed it.’ 

A glint came into his eyes, and Sam catching the gleam in the darkness 




thought it far from pleasant. 

Alive without breath; 
as cold as death; 
never thirsting, ever drinking; 
clad in mail, never clinking. 

Drowns on dry land, 
thinks an island 
is a mountain; 
thinks a fountain 
is a puff of air. 

So sleek, so fair! 

What a joy to meet! 

We only wish 
to catch a fish, 
so juicy-sweet! 

These words only made more pressing to Sam's mind a problem that had 
been troubling him from the moment when he understood that hir master was 
going to adopt Gollum as a guide: the problem of food. It did not occur to 
him that his master might also have thought of it. hut he supposed Gollum 
had. Indeed how had Gollum kept himself in all his lonely wandering? 'Not 
too well,' thought Sam. 'He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what 
hobbit tastes like if there ain't no fish, I'll wager — supposing as he 
could catch us napping. Well, he won't: not Sam Gamgee for one.' 

They stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it 
seemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam. The gully turned eastward, and as 
they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above 
grew faint with the first grey of morning. Gollum had shown no signs of 
tiring, but now he looked up and halted. 

'Day is near,' he whispered, as if Day was something that might 
overhear him and spring on him. 'Smjagol will stay here: I will stay here, 
and the Yellow Face won't see me.' 

'We should be glad to see the Sun;' said Frodo, 'but we will stay here: 
we are too tired to go any further at present.' 

'You are not wise to be glad of the Yellow Face,' said Gollum. 'It 
shows you up. Nice sensible hobbits stay with Smjagol. Ores and nasty things 
are about. They can see a long way. Stay and hide with me! ' 

The three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of 




the gully. It was not much more than a tall man’s height now, and at its 
base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel 
on the other side. Frodo and Sam sat on one of the flats, resting their 
backs. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream. 

'We must take a little food,' said Frodo. 'Are you hungry, Smjagol? We 
have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.’ 

At the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in Gollum’s pale eyes, 
and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. For 
a moment he relapsed into his old Gollum-manner. ’We are famisshed, yes 
famisshed we are. precious,’ he said. 'What is it they eats? Have they nice 
fisshes? ’ His tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth, licking his 
colourless lips. 

'No, we have got no fish,’ said Frodo. 'We have only got this’ — he 
held up a wafer of lembas — ’and water, if the water here is fit to drink.’ 

'Yess, yess, nice water,’ said Gollum. 'Drink it, drink it, while we 
can! But what is it they’ve got, precious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty? ’ 

Frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its 
leaf- wrapping. Gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of 
disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. 'Smjagol smells it! ’he 
said. 'Leaves out of the elf-country, gah! They stinks. He climbed in those 
trees, and he couldn’t wash the smell off his hands, my nice hands.’ 
Dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it. He spat, 
and a fit of coughing shook him. 

'Ach! No! ’ he spluttered. 'You try to choke poor Smjagol. Dust and 
ashes, he can’t eat that. He must starve. But Smjagol doesn't mind. Nice 
hobbits! Smjagol has promised. He will starve. He can’t eat hobbits' food. 

He will starve. Poor thin Smjagol! ' 

'I'm sorry,' said Frodo; 'but I can't help you, I'm afraid. I think 
this food would do you good, if you would try. But perhaps you can't even 
try, not yet anyway.’ 

The hobbits munched their lembas in silence. Sam thought that it tasted 
far better, somehow, than it had for a good while: Gollum's behaviour had 
made him attend to its flavour again. But he did not feel comfortable. 
Gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by 
diner's chair. Only when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was 
he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share 
in. Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little. 




'Look here! ' Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really 
care whether Gollum heard him or not. 'We’ve got to get some sleep; but not 
both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. Smjagol 
or Gollum, he won't change his habits in a hurry, I'll warrant. You go to 
sleep, Mr. Frodo, and I'll call you when I can't keep my eyelids propped up. 
Turn and about, same as before, while he's loose.' 

'Perhaps you're right, Sam,' said Frodo speaking openly. 'There is a 
change in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep, I'm not sure 
yet. Seriously though, I don't think there is any need for fear — at 
present. Still watch if you wish. Give me about two hours, not more, and 
then call me.' 

So tired was Frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he 
slept, almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed no longer to 
have any fears. He curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. 
Presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, hut he 
lay still as stone. After a while, fearing that he would drop off himself, 
if he sat listening to his two companions breathing, Sam got up and gently 
prodded Gollum. His hands uncurled and twitched, but he made no other 
movement. Sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear, but there was no 
response, not even a catch in Gollum's breathing. 

Sam scratched his head. 'Must really be asleep,' he muttered. 'And if I 
was like Gollum, he wouldn't wake up never again.' He restrained the 
thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat 
down by his master. 

When he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when 
they had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from his own feeling 
of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight 
away, nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched 
on his side. Gollum was not to be seen. Various reproachful names for 
himself came to Sam's mind, drawn from the Gaffer's large paternal 
word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: 
there had for the present been nothing to guard against. They were at any 
rate both alive and unthrottled. 

'Poor wretch! ' he said half remorsefully. 'Now I wonder where he's got 
to? ' 

'Not far, not far! ' said a voice above him. He looked up and saw the 
shape of Gollum's large head and ears against the evening sky. 




'Here, what are you doing? ' cried Sam, his suspicions coming back as 
soon as he saw that shape. 

'Smjagol is hungry,' said Gollum. 'Be back soon.' 

'Come back now!' shouted Sam. 'Hi! Come back!' But Gollum had vanished. 

Frodo woke at the sound of Sam's shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. 
'Hullo!' he said. 'Anything wrong? What's the time?' 

'I dunno,' said Sam. 'After sundown, I reckon. And he's gone off. Says 
he's hungry.' 

'Don't worry!' said Frodo. 'There's no help for it. But he'll come 
back, you'll see. The promise will hold yet a while. And he won't leave his 
Precious, anyway.' 

Frodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for 
hours with Gollum, and a very hungry Gollum too, loose beside them. 'Don't 
think of any of your Gaffer's hard names,' he said. 'You were worn out, and 
it has turned out well: we are now both rested. And we have a hard road 
ahead, the worst road of all.' 

'About the food,' said Sam. 'How long's it going to take us to do this 
job? And when it's done, what are we going to do then? This waybread keeps 
you on your legs in a wonderful way, though it doesn't satisfy the innards 
proper, as you might say: not to my feeling anyhow, meaning no disrespect to 
them as made it. But you have to eat some of it every day, and it doesn't 
grow. I reckon we've got enough to last, say, three weeks or so, and that 
with a tight belt and a light tooth, mind you. We've been a bit free with it 
so far.' 

'I don't know how long we shall take to — to finish,' said Frodo. 'We 
were miserably delayed in the hills. But Samwise Gamgee, my dear hobbit — 
indeed, Sam my dearest hobbit, friend of friends — I do not think we need 
give thought to what comes after that. To do the job as you put it — what 
hope is there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of 
that? If the One goes into the Fire, and we are at hand? I ask you, Sam, are 
we ever likely to need bread again? I think not. If we can nurse our limbs 
to bring us to Mount Doom, that is all we can do. More than I can, I begin 
to feel.’ 

Sam nodded silently. He took his master's hand and bent over it. He did 
not kiss it, though his tears fell on it. Then he turned away, drew his 
sleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle, and 
saying between the efforts: 'Where's that dratted creature?' 




It was actually not long before Gollum returned; but he came so quietly 
that they did not hear him till he stood before them. His fingers and face 
were soiled with black mud. He was still chewing and slavering. What he was 
chewing, they did not ask or like to think. 

'Worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes,' thought Sam. 'Brr! 

The nasty creature; the poor wretch! ' 

Gollum said nothing to them, until he had drunk deeply and washed 
himself in the stream. Then he came up to them, licking his lips. 'Better 
now,' he said. 'Are we rested? Ready to go on? Nice hobbits, they sleep 
beautifully. Trust Smjagol now? Very, very good.' 

The next stage of their journey was much the same as the last. As they 
went on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more 
gradual. Its bottom was less stony and more earthy, and slowly its sides 
dwindled to mere banks. It began to wind and wander. That night drew to its 
end, but clouds were now over moon and star, and they knew of the coming of 
day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light. 

In a chill hour they came to the end of the water -course. The banks 
became moss-grown mounds. Over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream 
gurgled and fell down into a brown bog and was lost. Dry reeds hissed and 
rattled though they could feel no wind. 

On either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay, stretching 
away southward and eastward into the dim half-light. Mists curled and smoked 
from dark and noisome pools. The reek of them hung stifling in the still 
air. Far away, now almost due south, the mountain-walls of Mordor loomed, 
like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea. 

The hobbits were now wholly in the hands of Gollum. They did now know, 
and could not guess in that misty light, that they were in fact only just 
within the northern borders of the marshes, the main expanse of which lay 
south of them. They could, if they had known the lands, with some delay have 
retraced their steps a little, and then turning east have come round over 
hard roads to the bare plain of Dagorlad: the field of the ancient battle 
before the gates of Mordor. Not that there was great hope in such a course. 

On that stony plain there was no cover, and across it ran the highways of 
the Ores and the soldiers of the Enemy. Not even the cloaks of Lurien would 
have concealed them there. 

'How do we shape our course now, Smjagol? ' asked Frodo. 'Must we cross 
these evil-smelling fens? ' 




'No need, no need at all,' said Gollum. 'Not if hobbits want to reach 
the dark mountains and go to see Him very quick. Back a little, and round a 
little' — his skinny arm waved north and east — 'and you can come on hard 
cold roads to the very gates of His country. Lots of His people will be 
there looking out for guests, very pleased to take them straight to Him, O 
yes. His Eye watches that way all the time. It caught Smjagol there, long 
ago.' Gollum shuddered. 'But Smjagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes: 
I've used eyes and feet and nose since then. 1 know other ways. More 
difficult, not so quick; but better, if we don't want Him to see. Follow 
Smjagol! He can take you through the marshes, through the mists, nice thick 
mists. Follow Smjagol very carefully, and you may go a long way. quite a 
long way, before He catches you, yes perhaps.' 

It was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the marsh-reeks 
lay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low clouded sky, and Gollum seemed 
anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a brief rest they set out 
again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of 
the lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that 
they sought. They went slowly in single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo. 

Frodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went, he 
often lagged. The hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen 
was really an endless network of pools, and soft mires, and winding 
half- strangled water -courses. Among these a cunning eye and foot could 
thread a wandering path. Gollum certainly had that cunning, and needed all 
of it. His head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that, while 
he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself. Sometimes he would hold up 
his hand and halt them, while he went forward a little, crouching, testing 
the ground with fingers or toes, or merely listening with one ear pressed to 
the earth. 

It was dreary and wearisome. Cold clammy winter still held sway in this 
forsaken country. The only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark 
greasy surfaces of the sullen waters. Dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed 
up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers. 

As the day wore on the light increased a little, and the mists lifted, 
growing thinner and more transparent. Far above the rot and vapours of the 
world the Sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors 
of dazzling foam, but only a passing ghost of her could they see below, 
bleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth. But even at this faint 




reminder of her presence Gollum scowled and flinched. He halted their 
journey, and they rested, squatting like little hunted animals, in the 
borders of a great brown reed-thicket. There was a deep silence, only 
scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken 
grass-blades trembling in small air -movements that they could not feel. 

'Not a bird! ' said Sam mournfully. 

'No, no birds,' said Gollum. 'Nice birds! ' He licked his teeth. 'No 
birds here. There are snakeses, wormses, things in the pools. Lots of 
things, lots of nasty things. No birds,' he ended sadly. Sam looked at him 
with distaste. 

So passed the third day of their journey with Gollum. Before the 
shadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on 
and on with only brief halts. These they made not so much for rest as to 
help Gollum; for now even he had to go forward with great care, and he was 
sometimes at a loss for a while. They had come to the very midst of the Dead 
Marshes, and it was dark. 

They walked slowly, stooping, keeping close in line, following 
attentively every move that Gollum made. The fens grew more wet, opening 
into wide stagnant meres, among which it grew more and more difficult to 
find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling 
mud. The travellers were light, or maybe none of them would ever have found 
a way through. 

Presently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and 
heavy to breathe. When lights appeared Sam rubbed his eyes: he thought his 
head was going queer. He first saw one with the corner of his left eye, a 
wisp of pale sheen that faded away; but others appeared soon after: some 
like dimly shining smoke, some like misty flames flickering slowly above 
unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by 
hidden hands. But neither of his companions spoke a word. 

At last Sam could bear it no longer. 'What's all this, Gollum? ' he 
said in a whisper. 'These lights? They're all round us now. Are we trapped? 
Who are they? ' 

Gollum looked up. A dark water was before him, and he was crawling on 
the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. 'Yes, they are all round 
us,' he whispered. 'The tricksy lights. Candles of corpses, yes, yes. Don't 
you heed them! Don't look! Don't follow them! Where's the master? ' 

Sam looked back and found that Frodo had lagged again. He could not see 




him. He went some paces back into the darkness, not daring to move far, or 
to call in more than a hoarse whisper. Suddenly he stumbled against Frodo, 
who was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. His hands hung 
stiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them. 

'Come, Mr. Frodo! ' said Sam. 'Don't look at them! Gollum says we 
mustn't. Let's keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as 
we can — if we can! ' 

'All right,' said Frodo, as if returning out of a dream. 'I'm coming. 

Go on! ' 

Hurrying forward again, Sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root 
or tussock. He fell and came heavily on his hands, which sank deep into 
sticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark 
mere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the lights flickered 
and danced and swirled. For a moment the water below him looked like some 
window, glazed with grimy glass, through which he was peering. Wrenching 
his 

hands out of the bog, he sprang back with a cry. 'There are dead things, 
dead faces in the water,' he said with horror. 'Dead faces ! ' 

Gollum laughed. 'The Dead Marshes, yes, yes: that is their names,' he 
cackled. 'You should not look in when the candles are lit.’ 

'Who are they? What are they? ’ asked Sam shuddering, turning to Frodo, 
who was now behind him. 

’I don't know,' said Frodo in a dreamlike voice. 'But I have seen them 
too. In the pools when the candles were lit. They lie in all the pools, pale 
faces, deep deep under the dark water. I saw them: grim faces and evil, and 
noble faces and sad. Many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver 
hair. But all foul, all rotting, all dead. A fell light is in them.' Frodo 
hid his eyes in his hands. 'I know not who they are; but I thought I saw 
there Men and Elves, and Ores beside them.' 

'Yes, yes,' said Gollum. 'All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and Ores. 

The Dead Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him 
when Smjagol was young, when I was young before the Precious came. It was 
a 

great battle. Tall Men with long swords, and terrible Elves, and Orcses 
shrieking. They fought on the plain for days and months at the Black Gates. 
But the Marshes have grown since then, swallowed up the graves; always 
creeping, creeping.' 




'But that is an age and more ago,' said Sam. The Dead can’t be really 
there! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land? ’ 

'Who knows? Smjagol doesn't know,' answered Gollum. 'You cannot reach 
them, you cannot touch them. We tried once, .yes, precious. I tried once; 
but you cannot reach them. Only shapes to see, perhaps, not to touch. No 
precious! All dead.' 

Sam looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed 
why Smjagol had tried to touch them. 'Well, I don't want to see them,' he 
said. 'Never again! Can't we get on and get away? ' 

'Yes, yes,' said Gollum. 'But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully! Or 
hobbits go down to join the Dead ones and light little candles. Follow 
Smjagol! Don't look at lights! ' 

He crawled away to the right, seeking for a path round the mere. They 
came close behind, stooping, often using their hands even as he did. 'Three 
precious little Gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,' 
thought Sam. 

At last they came to the end of the black mere, and they crossed it, 
perilously, crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tussock to 
another. Often they floundered, stepping or falling hands-first into waters 
as noisome as a cesspool, till they were slimed and fouled almost up to 
their necks and stank in one another's nostrils. 

It was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground 
again. Gollum hissed and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was 
pleased: in some mysterious way, by some blended sense of feel, and smell, 
and uncanny memory for shapes in the dark, he seemed to know just where he 
was again, and to be sure of his road ahead. 

'Now on we go! 'he said. 'Nice hobbits! Brave hobbits! Very very 
weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take master 
away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.' With these words he started 
off again, almost at a trot, down what appeared to be a long lane between 
high reeds, and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could. But in a 
little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully, hissing as 
if he was troubled or displeased again. 

'What is it? ' growled Sam, misinterpreting the signs. 'What's the need 
to sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and 
master stinks; the whole place stinks.' 

'Yes, yes, and Sam stinks! ' answered Gollum. 'Poor Smjagol smells it, 




but good Smjagol bears it. Helps nice master. But that's no matter. The 
air’s moving, change is coming. Smjagol wonders; he's not happy.' 

He went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and every now and again he 
stood up to his full height, craning his neck eastward and southward. For 
some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. Then 
suddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo and Sam it 
seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and 
cruel. They shivered. At the same moment the stirring of the air became 
perceptible to them; and it grew very cold. As they stood straining their 
ears, they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance. The misty 
lights wavered, dimmed, and went out. 

Gollum would not move. He stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until 
with a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling over the marshes. 
The night became less dark, light enough for them to see, or half see, 
shapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled over them and 
passed them. Looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then 
high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack. 

For a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but 
Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and 
Sam 

staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a 
small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from 
Mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded across the moon, and 
with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed. 

They fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth. But the 
shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right above them, 
sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then it was gone, flying 
back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind 
roared away, leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak. The naked waste, as 
far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, 
was dappled with the fitful moonlight. 

Frodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an 
evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But Gollum lay 
on the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him with difficulty, 
and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his 
elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands. 

'Wraiths!' he wailed. 'Wraiths on wings! The Precious is their master. 




They see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from them. Curse the White 
Face! And they tell Him everything. He sees, He knows. Ach, gollum, gollum, 
golluml ' It was not until the moon had sunk, westering far beyond Tol 
Brandir, that he would get up or make a move. 

From that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again. 

He was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam surprised some strange 
looks in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more 
and more into his old manner of speaking. And Sam had another growing 
anxiety. Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said 
nothing, indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he 
walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; 
and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum 
to wait and not to leave their master behind. 

In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring 
on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to 
feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards. But far more he was 
troubled by the Eye: so he called it to himself. It was that more than the 
drag of the Ring that made him cower and stoop as he walked. The Eye: that 
horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to 
pierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin 
you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the 
veils were become that still warded it off. Frodo knew just where the 
present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can 
tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its 
potency beat upon his brow. 

Gollum probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in 
his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring 
that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold 
iron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam's mind was 
occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had 
fallen on his own heart. He put Frodo in front of him now, and kept a 
watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and 
trying to encourage him with clumsy words. 

When day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer 
the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder, 
and though still far off, the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy menace 
on the edge of sight, but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal 




waste. The marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats 
of dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and 
pitiless, towards the desert that lay at Sauron’s gate. 

While the grey light lasted, they cowered under a black stone like 
worms, shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its 
cruel eyes. The remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in 
which memory could find nothing to rest upon. For two more nights they 
struggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them, 
grew harsh, and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and 
parched their mouths. 

At last, on the fifth morning since they took the road with Gollum, 
they halted once more. Before them dark in the dawn the great mountains 
reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from their feet were flung huge 
buttresses and broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen 
miles away. Frodo looked round in horror. Dreadful as the Dead Marshes had 
been, and the arid moors of the Noman-lands, more loathsome far was the 
country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes. 
Even to the Mere of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of green spring 
would 

come; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here 
nothing 

lived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The gasping 
pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if 
the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about. 

High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted 
and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly 
revealed in the reluctant light. 

They had come to the desolation that lay before Mordor: the lasting 
monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their 
purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing — 
unless the Great Sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion. V I feel 
sick,’ said Sam. Frodo did not speak. 

For a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where 
nightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to 
morning through the shadows. The light broadened and hardened. The 
gasping 

pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear. The sun was up, walking 




among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. The 
hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing them 
in their helplessness — little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the 
ash-heaps of the Dark Lord. 

Too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could 
rest. For a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of 
slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their throats and choking 
them. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering and cursing he rose, and 
without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. 
Frodo and Sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular 
pit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of 
oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered, 
hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye. 

The day passed slowly. A great thirst troubled them, but they drank 
only a few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully, which now as 
they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The 
hobbits took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they were, neither of 
them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow 
moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to be on guard. He lay back on 
the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on 
him. He looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark 
riding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hovering 
between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him. 

Suddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. It was 
evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid 
down nearly to the bottom of the pit. Gollum was by him. For a moment Sam 
thought that he was trying to rouse Frodo; then he saw that it was not so. 
Gollum was talking to himself. Smjagol was holding a debate with some other 
thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. A pale light 
and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke. 

'Smjagol promised,’ said the first thought. 

'Yes, yes, my precious,’ came the answer, ’we promised: to save our 
Precious, not to let Him have it — never. But it’s going to Him yes, nearer 
every step. What’s the hobbit going to do with it, we wonders, yes we 
wonders.’ 

'I don’t know. I can’t help it. Master’s got it. Smjagol promised to 
help the master.’ 




'Yes, yes, to help the master: the master of the Precious. But if we 
was master, then we could help ourself s, yes, and still keep promises.' 

'But Smjagol said he would be very very good. Nice hobbit! He took 
cruel rope off Smjagol's leg. He speaks nicely to me.' 

'Very very good, eh, my precious? Let's be good, good as fish, sweet 
one, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.' 

'But the Precious holds the promise,’ the voice of Smjagol objected. 

'Then take it,' said the other, 'and let's hold it ourselfs! Then we 
shall be master, golluml Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit, 
make him crawl, yes, golluml' 

'But not the nice hobbit? ’ 

'Oh no, not if it doesn't please us. Still he's a Baggins, my precious, 
yes, a Baggins. A Baggins stole it. He found it and he said nothing, 
nothing. We hates Bagginses.' 

'No, not this Baggins.' 

'Yes, every Baggins. All peoples that keep the Precious. We must have 
it! ' 

'But He'll see, He'll know. He'll take it from us! ' 

'He sees. He knows. He heard us make silly promises — against His 
orders, yes. Must take it. The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.' 

'Not for Him! ' 

'No, sweet one. See, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, 
even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord 
Smjagol? Gollum the Great? The Gollum! Eat fish every day, three times a 
day; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we 
wants it, we wants it! ' 

'But there's two of them. They'll wake too quick and kill us,' whined 
Smjagol in a last effort. 'Not now. Not yet.’ 

'We wants it! But' — and here there was a long pause, as if a new 
thought had wakened. 'Not yet, eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might, 
yes.’ 

'No, no! Not that way! ' wailed Smjagol. 

'Yes! We wants it! We wants it! ’ 

Each time that the second thought spoke, Gollum's long hand crept out 
slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as 
Smjagol 

spoke again. Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, 




clawed towards his neck. 

Sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move 
that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind 
ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in 
Gollum. He realized now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible 
call of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who 
She 

was. One of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, 
he supposed. Then he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far 
enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs, 
but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be 
careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. He let out a 
loud sigh and gave a huge yawn. 

'What's the time? ' he said sleepily. 

Gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. He stood up for a 
moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all 
fours and crawling up the bank of the pit. 'Nice hobbits! Nice Sam! ' he 
said. 'Sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! Leave good Smjagol to watch! But 
it's evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.' 

'High time! ' thought Sam. 'And time we parted, too.' Yet it crossed 
his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as 
kept with them. 'Curse him! I wish he was choked!' he muttered. He stumbled 
down the bank and roused his master. 

Strangely enough, Frodo felt refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark 
shadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this land of 
disease. Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt 
glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed 
him with dog-like delight. He chuckled and chattered, cracking his long 
fingers, and pawing at Frodo's knees. Frodo smiled at him. 

'Come! ' he said. 'You have guided us well and faithfully. This is the 
last stage. Bring us to the Gate, and then I will not ask you to go further. 

Bring us to the Gate, and you may go where you wish — only not to our 
enemies.' 

'To the Gate, eh?' Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised and frightened. 

'To the Gate, master says! Yes, he says so. And good Smjagol does what he 
asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we'll see perhaps we'll see then. It 
won't look nice at all. O no! O no!' 




’Go on with you! ' said Sam. 'Let's get it over! ' 

In the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded 
their way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once 
more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the 
marshes. They halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw 
nothing in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the menace passed, high 
overhead, going maybe on some swift errand from Barad-dyr. After a while 
Gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking. 

About an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it 
now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds, rushing 
with terrible speed into the West. Gollum, however, was helpless with 
terror, and was convinced that they were being hunted, that their approach 
was known. 

'Three times! ' he whimpered. 'Three times is a threat. They feel us 
here, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any 
further this way, no. It's no use, no use! ' 

Pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail. It was not until 
Frodo commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that Gollum 
would get up again. Then at last he rose with a snarl, and went before them 
like a beaten dog. 

So they stumbled on through the weary end of the night, and until the 
coming of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads, 
seeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears. 




Chapter 3 . The Black Gate is Closed 



Before the next day dawned their journey to Mordor was over. The 
marshes and the desert were behind them. Before them, darkling against a 
pallid sky, the great mountains reared their threatening heads. 

Upon the west of Mordor marched the gloomy range of Ephel D®ath, the 
Mountains of Shadow, and upon the north the broken peaks and barren ridges 
of Ered Lithui, grey as ash. But as these ranges approached one another, 
being indeed but parts of one great wall about the mournful plains of 
Lithlad and of Gorgoroth, and the bitter inland sea of N® men amidmost, they 
swung out long arms northward; and between these arms there was a deep 
defile. This was Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, the entrance to the land 
of the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from 
its mouth were two sheer hills, black -boned and bare. Upon them stood the 
Teeth of Mordor, two towers strong and tall. In days long past they were 
built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power, after the overthrow of 
Sauron and his flight, lest he should seek to return to his old realm. But 
the strength of Gondor failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers 
stood empty. Then Sauron returned. Now the watch-towers, which had fallen 
into decay, were repaired, and filled with arms, and garrisoned with 
ceaseless vigilance. Stony -faced they were, with dark window-holes staring 
north and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes. 

Across the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark Lord had 
built a rampart of stone. In it there was a single gate of iron, and upon 
its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the hills on either side 
the rock was bored into a hundred caves and maggot-holes: there a host of 
ores lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war. 

None could pass the Teeth of Mordor and not feel their bite, unless they 
were summoned by Sauron, or knew the secret passwords that would open 
the 

Morannon, the black gate of his land. 

The two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even from 
a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards 
upon the wall, and the patrols before the gate. They lay now peering over 
the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of the northmost 




buttress of Ephel D®ath. Winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow, 
maybe, would have flown but a furlong from their hiding-place to the black 
summit of the nearer tower. A faint smoke curled above it, as if fire 
smouldered in the hill beneath. 

Day came, and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of Ered 
Lithui. Then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was heard: from 
the watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in 
the hills came answering calls; and further still, remote but deep and 
ominous, there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums 
of Barad-dyr. Another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor; and 
the night-guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep halls, and the 
day-guards, evil-eyed and fell, were marching to their posts. Steel gleamed 
dimly on the battlement. 

'Well, here we are! ' said Sam. 'Here’s the Gate, and it looks to me as 
if that’s about as far as we are ever going to get. My word, but the Gaffer 
would have a thing or two to say, if he saw me now! Often said I’d come to a 
bad end, if I didn't watch my step, he did. But now I don't suppose I'll 
ever see the old fellow again. He'll miss his chance of I told'ee so, Sam: 
more's the pity. He could go on telling me as long as he'd got breath, if 
only I could see his old face again. But I'd have to get a wash first, or he 
wouldn't know me. 

'I suppose it's no good asking "what way do we go now?" We can't go no 
further -unless we want to ask the ores for a lift.' 

'No, no! ' said Gollum. 'No use. We can't go further. Smjagol said so. 

He said: we'll go to the Gate, and then we'll see. And we do see. O yes. my 
precious, we do see. Smjagol knew hobbits could not go this way. O yes. 
Smjagol knew ' 

'Then what the plague did you bring us here for? ' said Sam, not 
feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable. 

'Master said so. Master says: Bring us to the Gate. So good Smjagol 
does so. Master said so, wise master.' 

'I did,' said Frodo. His face was grim and set. but resolute. He was 
filthy, haggard, and pinched with weariness, but he cowered no longer, and 
his eyes were clear. 'I said so, because I purpose to enter Mordor, and I 
know no other way. Therefore I shall go this way. I do not ask anyone to go 
with me.’ 

'No, no, master! ' wailed Gollum; pawing at him, and seeming in great 




distress. 'No use that way! No use! Don’t take the Precious to Him! He'll 
eat us all, if He gets it, eat all the world. Keep it, nice master, and be 
kind to Smjagol. Don’t let Him have it. Or go away, go to nice places, and 
give it back to little Smjagol. Yes, yes, master: give it back, eh? Smjagol 
will keep it safe; he will do lots of good, especially to nice hobbits. 

Hobbits go home. Don’t go to the Gate! ’ 

'I am commanded to go to the land of Mordor, and therefore I shall go,’ 
said Frodo. 'If there is only one way, then I must take it. What comes after 
must come.' 

Sam said nothing. The look on Frodo's face was enough for him he knew 
that words of his were useless. And after all he never had any real hope in 
the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed 
hope, as long as despair could be postponed. Now they were come to the 
bitter end. But he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had 
chiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. His master would not go 
to Mordor alone. Sam would go with him-and at any rate they would get rid of 
Gollum. 

Gollum, however, did not intend to be got rid of, yet. He knelt at 
Frodo's feet, wringing his hands and squeaking. 'Not this way, master! ' he 
pleaded, 'There is another way. O yes indeed there is. Another way. darker, 
more difficult to find, more secret. But Smjagol knows it. Let Smjagol show 
you! ' 

'Another way! ' said Frodo doubtfully, looking down at Gollum with 
searching eyes. 

'Yess! Yess indeed! There was another way. Smjagol found it. Let's go 
and see if it's still there! ' 

'You have not spoken of this before.’ 

'No. Master did not ask. Master did not say what he meant to do. He 
does not tell poor Smjagol. He says: Smjagol, take me to the Gate — and 
then good bye! Smjagol can run away and be good. But now he says: I purpose 
to enter Mordor this way. So Smjagol is very afraid. He does not want to 
lose nice master. And he promised, master made him promise, to save the 
Precious. But master is going to take it to Him, straight to the Black Hand, 
if master will go this way. So Smjagol must save them both, and he thinks of 
another way that there was, once upon a time. Nice master. Smjagol very 
good, always helps.' 

Sam frowned. If he could have bored holes in Gollum with his eyes, he 




would have done. His mind was full of doubt. To all appearances Gollum was 
genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo. But Sam, remembering the 
overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Smjagol 
had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the 
debate. Sam's guess was that the Smjagol and Gollum halves (or what in his 
own mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary 
alliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep 
Frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible — at any rate 
as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his ’Precious'. 
Whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted. 

'And it's a good thing neither half of the old villain don't know what 
master means to do,' he thought. 'If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put 
an end to his Precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, I 
bet. Anyhow old Stinker is so frightened of the Enemy — and he's under 
orders of some kind from him, or was — that he'd give us away rather than 
be caught helping us; and rather than let his Precious be melted, maybe. At 
least that's my idea. And I hope the master will think it out carefully. 

He's as wise as any, but he's soft-hearted, that's what he is. It's beyond 
any Gamgee to guess what he'll do next.' 

Frodo did not answer Gollum at once. While these doubts were passing 
through Sam's slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark 
cliff of Cirith Gorgor. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved 
in the side of a low hill, at some little height above a long trenchlike 
valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. In the 
midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch-tower. 

By morning -light the roads that converged upon the Gate of Mordor could 
now 

be clearly seen, pale and dusty; one winding back northwards; another 
dwindling eastwards into the mists that clung about the feet of Ered Lithui; 
and a third that ran towards him. As it bent sharply round the tower, it 
entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood. 
Westward, to his right, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains, 
and went off southwards into the deep shadows that mantled all the western 
sides of Ephel D®ath; beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land 
between the mountains and the Great River. 

As he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement 
on the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the march, though for the 




most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and 
wastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets; 
and over the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many 
companies. He remembered his vision from afar upon Amon Hen, so few 
days 

before, though now it seemed many years ago. Then he knew that the hope that 
had for one wild moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not 
rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark Lord by 
the men of Gondor, risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long 
passed away. These were Men of other race, out of the wide Eastlands, 
gathering to the summons of their Overlord; armies that had encamped before 
his Gate by night and now marched in to swell his mounting power. As if 
suddenly made fully aware of the peril of their position, alone, in the 
growing light of day, so near to this vast menace, Frodo quickly drew his 
frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. Then he 
turned to Gollum. 

'Smjagol,' he said, 'I will trust you once more. Indeed it seems that I 
must do so, and that it is my fate to receive help from you. where I least 
looked for it, and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil 
purpose. So far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise 
truly. Truly, I say and mean,' he added with a glance at Sam, 'for twice now 
we have been in your power, and you have done no harm to us. Nor have you 
tried to take from me what you once sought. May the third time prove the 
best! But I warn you, Smjagol, you are in danger.' 

'Yes, yes, master! ' said Gollum. 'Dreadful danger! Smjagol's bones 
shake to think of it. but he doesn't run away. He must help nice master.' 

'I did not mean the danger that we all share,' said Frodo. 'I mean a 
danger to yourself alone. You swore a promise by what you call the Precious. 
Remember that! It will hold you to it; but it will seek a way to twist it to 
your own undoing. Already you are being twisted. You revealed yourself to me 
just now, foolishly. Give it back to Smjagol you said. Do not say that 
again! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will never get it back. But 
the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back. 

In the last need, Smjagol, I should put on the Precious; and the Precious 
mastered you long ago. If I, wearing it, were to command you, you would 
obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the 
fire. And such would be my command. So have a care, Smjagol!' 




Sam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise: there 
was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before. 

It had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear Mr. Frodo was 
of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness. Of 
course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the 
wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and 
of Gandalf). Gollum in his own way, and with much more excuse as his 
acquaintance was much briefer, may have _made a similar mistake, confusing 
kindness and blindness. At any rate this speech abashed and terrified him. 

He grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master. 

Frodo waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly. 

'Come now, Gollum or Smjagol if you wish, tell me of this other way, and 
show me, if you can, what hope there is in it, enough to justify me in 
turning aside from my plain path. I am in haste.' 

But Gollum was in a pitiable state, and Frodo's threat had quite 
unnerved him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his 
mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled 
on the floor and begged them both to be kind to 'poor little Smjagol'. After 
a while he grew a little calmer, and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a 
traveller followed the road that turned west of Ephel D®ath, he would come 
in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees. On the right a road went 
down to Osgiliath and the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went 
on southwards. 

'On, on, on,' said Gollum. 'We never went that way, but they say it 
goes a hundred leagues, until you can see the Great Water that is never 
still. There are lots of fishes there, and big birds eat fishes: nice birds: 
but we never went there, alas no! we never had a chance. And further still 
there are more lands, they say, but the Yellow Face is very hot there, and 
there are seldom any clouds, and the men are fierce and have dark faces. We 
do not want to see that land.' 

'No! ' said Frodo. 'But do not wander from your road. What of the third 
turning? ’ 

'O yes, O yes, there is a third way,' said Gollum. 'That is the road to 
the left. At once it begins to climb up, up, winding and climbing back 
towards the tall shadows. When it turns round the black rock, you'll see it. 
suddenly you'll see it above you, and you'll want to hide.' 

'See it, see it? What will you see? ’ 




'The old fortress, very old, very horrible now. We used to hear tales 
from the South, when Smjagol was young, long ago. O yes. we used to tell 
lots of tales in the evening, sitting by the banks of the Great River, in 
the willow-lands, when the River was younger too, gollum, gollum.' He began 
to weep and mutter. The hobbits waited patiently. 

'Tales out of the South,’ Gollum went on again, 'about the tall Men 
with the shining eyes, and their houses like hills of stone, and the silver 
crown of their King and his White Tree: wonderful tales. They built very 
tall towers, and one they raised was silver-white, and in it there was a 
stone like the Moon, and round it were great white walls. O yes, there were 
many tales about the Tower of the Moon.’ 

'That would be Minas Ithil that Isildur the son of Elendil built ’ said 
Frodo. 'It was Isildur who cut off the finger of the Enemy.’ 

'Yes, He has only four on the Black Hand, but they are enough,’ said 
Gollum shuddering. ’And He hated Isildur’ s city.’ 

’What does he not hate? ’ said Frodo. ’But what has the Tower of the 
Moon to do with us? ’ 

’Well, master, there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the 
white houses and the wall; but not nice now, not beautiful. He conquered it 
long ago. It is a very terrible place now. Travellers shiver when they see 
it, they creep out of sight, they avoid its shadow. But master will have to 
go that way. That is the only other way, For the mountains are lower there, 
and the old road goes up and up, until it reaches a dark pass at the top, 
and then it goes down, down, again — to Gorgoroth.’ His voice sank to a 
whisper and he shuddered. 

'But how will that help us? ’ asked Sam. 'Surely the Enemy knows all 
about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as this? The 
tower isn’t empty, is it? ’ 

'O no, not empty! ’ whispered Gollum. 'It seems empty, but it isn’t, O 
no! Very dreadful things live there. Ores, yes always Ores; but worse 
things, worse things live there too. The road climbs right under the shadow 
of the walls and passes the gate. Nothing moves on the road that they don’t 
know about. The things inside know: the Silent Watchers.’ 

'So that’s your advice is it,’ said Sam, ’that we should go another 
long march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one, when we 
get there, if we ever do? ’ 

'No, no indeed,’ said Gollum. 'Hobbits must see, must try to 




understand. He does not expect attack that way. His Eye is all round, but it 
attends more to some places than to others. He can't see everything all at 
once, not yet. You see, He has conquered all the country west of the Shadowy 
Mountains down to the River, and He holds the bridges now. He thinks no one 
can come to the Moontower without fighting big battle at the bridges, or 
getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and He will know about.' 

'You seem to know a lot about what He's doing and thinking,' said Sam. 
'Have you been talking to Him lately? Or just hobnobbing with Ores? ' 

'Not nice hobbit, not sensible,' said Gollum, giving Sam an angry 
glance and turning to Frodo. 'Smjagol has talked to Ores, yes of course, 
before he met master, and to many peoples: he has walked very far. And what 
he says now many peoples are saying. It's here in the North that the big 
danger is for Him, and for us. He will come out of the Black Gate one day, 
one day soon. That is the only way big armies can come. But away down west 
He is not afraid, and there are the Silent Watchers.' 

'Just so! ' said Sam, not to be put off. 'And so we are to walk up and 
knock at their gate and ask if we're on the right road for Mordor? Or are 
they too silent to answer? It's not. sense. We might as well do it here, and 
save ourselves a long tramp.' 

'Don't make jokes about it,' hissed Gollum. 'It isn't funny, O no! Not 
amusing. It's nut sense to try and get into Mordor at all. But if master 
says I must go or I will go, then he must try some way. But he must not go 
to the terrible city, O no, of course not. That is where Smjagol helps, nice 
Smjagol. though no one tells him what it is all about. Smjagol helps again. 

He found it. He knows it.' 

'What did you find? ' asked Frodo. 

Gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again. 'A little 
path leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, O yes, 
very long and narrow. And then more stairs. And then' — his voice sank even 
lower — 'a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last a little cleft, and a path 
high above the main pass. It was that way that Smjagol got out of the 
darkness. But it was years ago. The path may have vanished now; but perhaps 
not, perhaps not.' 

'I don't like the sound of it at all,' said Sam. 'Sounds too easy at 
any rate in the telling. If that path is still there, it'll be guarded too. 

Wasn't it guarded, Gollum? ' As he said this, he caught or fancied he caught 
a green gleam in Gollum' s eye. Gollum muttered but did not reply. 




'Is it not guarded? ' asked Frodo sternly. 'And did you escape out of 
the darkness, Smjagol? Were you not rather permitted to depart upon an 
errand? That at least is w hat Aragorn thought, who found you by the Dead 
Marshes some years ago.' 

'It's a lie! ' hissed Gollum, and an evil light came into his eyes at 
the naming of Aragorn. 'He lied on me, yes he did. I did escape, all by my 
poor self. Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious; and I have searched 
and searched, of course I have. But not for the Black One. The Precious was 
ours, it was mine I tell you. I did escape.' 

Frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once 
not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a 
way out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. For 
one thing, he noted that Gollum used I, and that seemed usually to be a 
sign, on its rare appearances, that some remnants of old truth and sincerity 
were for the moment on top. But even if Gollum could be trusted on this 
point, Frodo did not forget the wiles of the Enemy. The 'escape' may have 
been allowed or arranged, and well known in the Dark Tower. And in any case 
Gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back. 

'I ask you again,' he said: 'is not this secret way guarded? ’ 

But the name of Aragorn had put Gollum into a sullen mood. He had all 
the injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth, or 
part of it. He did not answer. 

'Is it not guarded? ' Frodo repeated. 

'Yes, yes, perhaps. No safe places in this country,' said Gollum 
sulkily. 'No safe places. But master must try it or go home. . No other 
way.' They could not get him to say more. The name of the perilous place and 
the high pass he could not tell, or would not. 

Its name was Cirith Ungol, a name of dreadful rumour. Aragorn could 
perhaps have told them that name and its significance: Gandalf would have 
warned them. But they were alone, and Aragorn was far away, and Gandalf 
stood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason. 
Yet even as he spoke his last words to Saruman, and the palantnr crashed in 
fire upon the steps of Orthanc. his thought was ever upon Frodo and Samwise, 
over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity. 

Maybe Frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon Amon Hen, even 
though he believed that Gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in 
Moria far away. He sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his head 




bowed, striving to recall all that Gandalf had said to him. But for this 
choice he could recall no counsel. Indeed Gandalf s guidance had been taken 
from them too soon, too soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away. 
How they should enter it at the last Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could 
not say. Into the stronghold of the Enemy in the North, into Dol Guldur, he 
had once ventured. But into Mordor, to the Mountain of Fire and to 
Barad-dyr, since the Dark Lord rose in power again, had he ever journeyed 
there? Frodo did not think so. And here he was a little halfling from the 
Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where 
the great ones could not go, or dared not go. It was an evil fate. But he 
had taken it on himself in his own sitting-room in the far-off spring of 
another year, so remote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the 
world's youth, when the Trees of Silver and Gold were still in bloom. This 
was an evil choice. Which way should he choose? And if both led to terror 
and death, what good lay in choice? 

The day drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where 
they lay, so near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could 
be felt, as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world 
about them. Above them was a dome of pale sky barred with fleeting smoke, 
but it seemed high and far away, as if seen through great deeps of air heavy 
with brooding thought. 

Not even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the hobbits 
sitting there, under the weight of doom, silent, p not moving, shrouded in 
their thin grey cloaks. For a moment he might have paused to consider 
Gollum, a tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the 
famished skeleton of some child of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to 
it, its long arms and legs almost bone -white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a 
peck. 

Frodo’s head was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands 
behind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky. At least for a 
long while it was empty. Then presently Sam thought he saw a dark bird-like 
figure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and then wheel away 
again. Two more followed, and then a fourth. They were very small to look 
at, yet he knew, somehow, that they were huge, with a vast stretch of 
pinion, flying at a great height. He covered his eyes and bent forward, 
cowering. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of 
the Black Riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind 




and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: 
the menace was more remote. But menace it was. Frodo felt it too. His 
thought was broken. He stirred and shivered, but he did not look up. Gollum 
huddled himself together like a cornered spider. The winged shapes wheeled, 
and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to Mordor. 

Sam took a deep breath. 'The Riders are about again, up in the air,' he 
said in a hoarse whisper. 'I saw them. Do you think they could see us? They 
were very high up. And if they are Black Riders same as before, then they 
can’t see much by daylight, can they? ' 

'No, perhaps not,' said Frodo. 'But their steeds could see. And these 
winged creatures that they ride on now, they can probably see more than any 
other creature. They are like great carrion birds. They are looking for 
something: the Enemy is on the watch, I fear.’ 

The feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding silence was broken. For 
some time they had been cut off from the world, as if in an invisible 
island; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned. But still Frodo 
did not speak to Gollum or make his choice. His eyes were closed, as if he 
were dreaming, or looking inward into his heart and memory. At last he 
stirred and stood up, and it seemed that he was about to speak and to 
decide. But 'hark!' he said. 'What is that?’ 

A new fear was upon them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At 
first it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards 
them. It leaped into all their minds that the Black Wings had spied them and 
had sent armed soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these 
terrible servants of Sauron. They crouched, listening. The voices and the 
clink of weapons and harness were very close. Frodo and Sam loosened their 
small swords in their sheaths. Flight was impossible. 

Gollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow. 

Very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it 
between two broken points of stone. He remained there without moving for 
some time, making no sound. Presently the voices began to recede again, and 
then they slowly faded away. Far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the 
Morannon. Then quietly Gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow. 

’More Men going to Mordor,’ he said in a low voice. 'Dark faces. We 
have not seen Men like these before, no, Smjagol has not. They are fierce. 
They have black eyes, and long black hair, and gold rings in their ears; 
yes, lots of beautiful gold. And some have red paint on their cheeks, and 




red cloaks; and their flags are red, and the tips of their spears; and they 
have round shields, yellow and black with big spikes. Not nice; very cruel 
wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Ores, and much bigger. Smjagol 
thinks 

they have come out of the South beyond the Great River's end: they came up 
that road. They have passed on to the Black Gate; but more may follow. 
Always more people coming to Mordor. One day all the peoples will be 
inside.' 

'Were there any oliphaunts?' asked Sam, forgetting his fear in his 
eagerness for news of strange places. 

'No, no oliphaunts. What are oliphaunts? ’ said Gollum. 

Sam stood up, putting his hands behind his back (as he always did when 
'speaking poetry'), and began: 

Grey as a mouse, 

Big as a house. 

Nose like a snake, 

I make the earth shake, 

As I tramp through the grass; 

Trees crack as I pass. 

With horns in my mouth 
I walk in the South, 

Flapping big ears. 

Beyond count of years 
I stump round and round, 

Never lie on the ground, 

Not even to die. 

Oliphaunt am I, 

Biggest of all, 

Huge, old, and tall. 

If ever you'd met me 
You wouldn 't forget me. 

If you never do, 

You won't think I'm true; 

But old Oliphaunt am I, 

And I never lie. 

'That,' said Sam, when he had finished reciting, 'that's a rhyme we 
have in the Shire. Nonsense maybe, and maybe not. But we have our tales too, 




and news out of the South, you know. In the old days hobbits used to go on 
their travels now and again. Not that many ever came back, and not that all 
they said was believed: news from Bree , and not sure as Shiretalk, as the 
sayings go. But I've heard tales of the big folk down away in the Sunlands. 
Swertings we call ’em in our tales; and they ride on oliphaunts, 'tis said, 
when they fight. They put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and 
all, and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another. So when you 
said "Men out of the South, all in red and gold;" I said "were there any 
oliphaunts? " For if there was, I was going to take a look, risk or no. But 
now I don't suppose I'll ever see an oliphaunt. Maybe there ain't no such a 
beast.' He sighed. 

'No, no oliphaunts,' said Gollum again. 'Smjagol has not heard of them. 

He does not want to see them. He does not want them to be. Smjagol wants to 
go away from here and hide somewhere safer. Smjagol wants master to go. 
Nice 

master, won't he come with Smjagol? ' 

Frodo stood up. He had laughed in the midst of all his cares when Sam 
trotted out the old fireside rhyme of Oliphaunt , and the laugh had released 
him from hesitation. 'I wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with Gandalf on a 
white one at their head,' he said. 'Then we'd break a way into this evil 
land, perhaps. But we've not; just our own tired legs, that's all. Well, 
Smjagol, the third turn may turn the best. I will come with you.' 

'Good master, wise master, nice master!' cried Gollum in delight, 
patting Frodo's knees. 'Good master! Then rest now, nice hobbits, under the 
shadow of the stones, close under the stones ! Rest and lie quiet, till the 
Yellow Face goes away. Then we can go quickly. Soft and quick as shadows 
we 

must be!’ 




Chapter 4 . Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit 



For the few hours of daylight that were left they rested, shifting into 
the shade as the sun moved, until at last the shadow of the western rim of 
their dell grew long, and darkness filled all the hollow. Then they ate a 
little, and drank sparingly. Gollum ate nothing, but he accepted water 
gladly. 

'Soon get more now,' he said, licking his lips. 'Good water runs down 
in streams to the Great River, nice water in the lands we are going to. 
Smjagol will get food there too, perhaps. He's very hungry, yes, gollumV He 
set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly, and a pale green light 
came into his eyes. 

The dusk was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the 
westward rim of the dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on 
the borders of the road: The moon was now three nights from the full, but it 
did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the early night 
was very dark. A single red light burned high up in the Towers of the Teeth, 
but otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the 
Morannon. 

For many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled, 
stumbling through a barren stony country. They did not dare to take the 
road, but they kept it on their left, following its line as well as they 
could at a little distance. At last, when night was growing old and they 
were already weary, for they had taken only one short rest, the eye dwindled 
to a small fiery point and then vanished: they had turned the dark northern 
shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards. 

With hearts strangely lightened they now rested again, but not for 
long. They were not going quick enough for Gollum. By his reckoning it was 
nearly thirty leagues from the Morannon to the cross-roads above Osgiliath, 
and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys. So soon they struggled 
on once more, until the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide grey 
solitude. They had then walked almost eight leagues; and the hobbits could 
not have gone any further, even if they had dared. 

The growing light revealed to them a land already, less barren and 
ruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their left, but near at 
hand they could see the southward road, now bearing away from the black 




roots of the hills and slanting westwards. Beyond it were slopes covered 
with sombre trees like dark clouds, but all about them lay a tumbled 
heathland, grown with ling and broom and cornel, and other shrubs that they 
did not know. Here and there they saw knots of tall pine-trees. The hearts 
of the hobbits rose again a little in spite of weariness: the air was fresh 
and fragrant, and it reminded them of the uplands of the Northfarthing far 
away. It seemed good to be reprieved, to walk in a land that had only been 
for a few years under the dominion of the Dark Lord and was not yet fallen 
wholly into decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the Black Gate 
that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights. 
They looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes 
while the light lasted. 

The day passed uneasily. They lay deep in the heather and counted out 
the slow hours, in which there seemed little change; for they were still 
under the shadows of the Ephel D®ath, and the sun was veiled. Frodo slept at 
times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble 
about him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum 
was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams. 
Hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long 
for a good homely meal, 'something hot out of the pot'. 

As soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they 
started out again. In a little while Gollum led them down on to the 
southward road; and after that they went on more quickly, though the danger 
was greater. Their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the 
road ahead, or following them from behind; but the night passed, and they 
heard no sound of walker or rider. 

The road had been made in a long lost time: and for perhaps thirty 
miles below the Morannon it had been newly repaired, but as it went south 
the wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of Men of old could still be seen 
in its straight sure flight and level course: now and again it cut its way 
through hillside slopes, or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of 
enduring masonry; but at last all signs of stonework faded, save for a 
broken pillar here and there, peering out of bushes at the side, or old 
paving-stones still lurking amid weeds and moss. Heather and trees and 
bracken scrambled down and overhung the banks, or sprawled out over the 
surface. It dwindled at last to a country cart-road little used; but it did 
not wind: it held on its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest 




way. 

So they passed into the northern marches of that land that Men once 
called Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift -falling streams. 

The night became fine under star and round moon, and it seemed to the 
hobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward; and from 
the blowing and muttering of Gollum it seemed that he noticed it too, and 
did not relish it. At the first signs of day they halted again. They had 
come to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer-sided in the middle, by 
which the road clove its way through a stony ridge. Now they climbed up the 
westward bank and looked abroad. 

Day was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were now 
much further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the 
distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran down into dim 
hazes far below. All about them were small woods of resinous trees, fir and 
cedar and cypress, and other kinds unknown in the Shire, with wide glades 
among them; and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and 
shrubs. The long journey from Rivendell had brought them far south of their 
own land, but not until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits 
felt the change of clime. Here Spring was already busy about them: fronds 
pierced moss and mould, larches were green-fingered, small flowers were 
opening in the turf, birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now 
desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness. 

South and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of Anduin, 
shielded from the east by the Ephel D®ath and yet not under the 
mountain-shadow, protected from the north by the Emyn Muil, open to the 
southern airs and the moist winds from the Sea far away. Many great trees 
grew there, planted long ago, falling into untended age amid a riot of 
careless descendants; and groves and thickets there were of tamarisk and 
pungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and there were junipers and myrtles; 
and thymes that grew in bushes, or with their woody creeping stems mantled 
in deep tapestries the hidden stones; sages of many kinds putting forth blue 
flowers, or red, or pale green; and marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys, 
and many herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of Sam. The grots 
and rocky walls were already starred with saxifrages and stonecrops. 
Primeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert -brakes; and asphodel and 
many lily -flowers nodded their half-opened heads in the grass: deep green 
grass beside the pools, where falling streams halted in cool hollows on 




their journey down to Anduin. 

The travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill. As 
they walked, brushing their way through bush and herb, sweet odours rose 
about them. Gollum coughed and retched; but the hobbits breathed deep, and 
suddenly Sam laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. They followed a stream 
that went quickly down before them. Presently it brought them to a small 
clear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone 
basin, the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and 
rose-brambles; iris-swords stood in ranks about it. and water-lily leaves 
floated on its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and 
spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end. 

Here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling 
freshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for this 
land, fair-seeming still, was nonetheless now territory of the Enemy. They 
had not come very far from the road, and yet even in so short a space they 
had seen scars of the old wars, and the newer wounds made by the Ores and 
other foul servants of the Dark Lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse; 
trees hewn down wantonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign 
of the Eye cut in rude strokes on their bark. 

Sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake, smelling and touching the 
unfamiliar plants and trees, forgetful for the moment of Mordor, was 
reminded suddenly of their ever-present peril. He stumbled on a ring still 
scorched by fire, and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and 
broken bones and skulls. The swift growth of the wild with briar and 
eglantine and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this place 
of dreadful feast and slaughter; but it was not ancient. He hurried back to 
his companions, but he said nothing: the bones were best left in peace and 
not pawed and routed by Gollum. 

'Let's find a place to lie up in,' he said. 'Not lower down. Higher up 
for me.' 

A little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last 
year's fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark -leaved bay-trees climbing up a 
steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. Here they decided to rest and 
pass the day, which already promised to be bright and warm. A good day for 
strolling on their way along the groves and glades of Ithilien; but though 
Ores may shun the sunlight, there were too many places here where they could 
lie hid and watch; and other evil eyes were abroad: Sauron had many 




servants. Gollum, in any case, would not move under the Yellow. Face. Soon 
it would look over the dark ridges of the Ephel D®ath, and he would faint 
and cower in the light and heat. 

Sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched. Now that 
the despair of the impassable Gate was behind him, he did not feel so 
inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the 
end of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread 
of the Elves for worse times ahead. Six days or more had passed since he 
reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks. 

'If we reach the Fire in that time, we'll be lucky at this rate ! ' he 
thought. 'And we might be wanting to get back. We might! ' 

Besides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and 
drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper, or a breakfast, by 
the fire in the old kitchen at Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An 
idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun to sneak off 
on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern. 

'Hi! Gollum! ' said Sam. 'Where are you going? Hunting? Well see here, 
old noser, you don't like our food, and I'd not be sorry for a change 
myself. Your new motto's always ready to help. Could you find anything fit 
for a hungry hobbit? ' 

'Yes, perhaps, yes,’ said Gollum. 'Smjagol always helps, if they asks 
— if they asks nicely.' 

'Right!' said Sam 'I does ask. And if that isn't nice enough, I begs.' 

Gollum disappeared. He was away some time, and Frodo after a few 
mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep. Sam 
looked at him. The early daylight was only just creeping down into the 
shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his 
hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly 
of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of Elrond, after his deadly 
wound. Then as he had kept watch Sam had noticed that at times a light 
seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and 
stronger. Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; 
but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping 
years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, 
though the identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it 
that way to himself. He shook his head, as if finding words useless, and 
murmured: 'I love him. He's like that, and sometimes it shines through, 




somehow. But I love him, whether or no.' 

Gollum returned quietly and peered over Sam's shoulder. Looking at 
Frodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. Sam came to him 
moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself. 
On 

the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was beginning to eye 
greedily. 

’Smjagol always helps,’ he said. 'He has brought rabbits, nice rabbits. 

But master has gone to sleep, and perhaps Sam wants to sleep. Doesn't want 
rabbits now? Smjagol tries to help, but he can't catch things all in a 
minute.' 

Sam, however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least 
not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of course, can cook, for they begin to 
learn the art before their letters (which many never reach): but Sam was a 
good cook, even by hobbit reckoning, and he had done a good deal of the 
camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a chance. He still hopefully 
carried some of his gear in his pack: a small tinder-box, two small shallow 
pans, the smaller fitting into the larger; inside them a wooden spoon, a 
short two-pronged fork and some skewers were stowed; and hidden at the 
bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But 
he needed a fire, and other things besides. He thought for a bit, while he 
took out his knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits. 

He was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes. 

'Now, Gollum,' he said, 'I've another job for you. Go and fill these 
pans with water, and bring 'em back! ' 

'Smjagol will fetch water, yes,' said Gollum. 'But what does the hobbit 
want all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.' 

'Never you mind,' said Sam. 'If you can't guess, you'll soon find out. 

And the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you'll learn. Don't you 
damage one of my pans, or I'll carve you into mincemeat.' 

While Gollum was away Sam took another look at Frodo. He was still 
sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face 
and hands. 'Too thin and drawn he is,' he muttered. 'Not right for a hobbit. 

If I can get these coneys cooked, I'm going to wake him up.' 

Sam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled up the bank 
collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a cedar 
at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the 




bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel 
in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It 
made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping 
over his fire, shielding it and building it up with heavier wood, when 
Gollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself. 

He set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what Sam was doing. He gave 
a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. 'Ach! Sss 
— no!' he cried. 'No! Silly hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! They mustn't do 
it!’ 

'Mustn't do what?' asked Sam in surprise. 

'Not make the nassty red tongues,' hissed Gollum. 'Fire, fire! It's 
dangerous, yes it is. It burns, it kills. And it will bring enemies, yes it 
will.' 

'I don't think so,' said Sam. 'Don't see why it should, if you don't 
put wet stuff on it and make a smother. But if it does, it does. I'm going 
to risk it, anyhow. I'm going to stew these coneys.' 

'Stew the rabbits!' squealed Gollum in dismay. 'Spoil beautiful meat 
Smjagol saved for you, poor hungry Smjagol! What for? What for, silly 
hobbit? They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Eat them, eat them!’ 

He clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire. 

'Now, now! ' said Sam. 'Each to his own fashion. Our bread chokes you, 
and raw coney chokes me. If you give me a coney, the coney's mine, see, to 
cook, if I have a mind. And I have. You needn't watch me. Go and catch 
another and eat it as you fancy — somewhere private and out o' my sight. 
Then you won't see the fire, and I shan't see you, and we'll both be the 
happier. I'll see the fire don't smoke, if that's any comfort to you.' 

Gollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. Sam busied 
himself with his pans. 'What a hobbit needs with coney,' he said to himself, 

'is some herbs and roots, especially taters — not to mention bread. Herbs 
we can manage, seemingly.’ 

'Gollum!' he called softly. 'Third time pays for all. I want some 
herbs.’ Gollum's head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither 
helpful nor friendly. 'A few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do — 
before the water boils,' said Sam. 

'No! ' said Gollum. 'Smjagol is not pleased. And Smjagol doesn't like 
smelly leaves. He doesn't eat grasses or roots, no precious, not till he's 
starving or very sick, poor Smjagol. ' 




'Smjagol'll get into real true hot water, when this water boils, if he 
don’t do as he’s asked,’ growled Sam. 'Sam'llput his head in it, yes 
precious. And I’d make him look for turnips and carrots, and taters too, if 
it was the time o’ the year. I’ll bet there’s all sorts of good things 
running wild in this country. I’d give a lot for half a dozen taters.’ 

'Smjagol won’t go, O no precious, not this time,’ hissed Gollum. 'He’s 
frightened, and he’s very tired, and this hobbit's not nice, not nice at 
all. Smjagol won't grub for roots and carrotses and — taters. What's 
taters, precious, eh, what's taters? 

'Po-ta-toes,' said Sam. 'The Gaffer’s delight, and rare good ballast 
for an empty belly. But you won't find any, so you needn't look. But be good 
Smjagol and fetch me the herbs, and I'll think better of you. What's more, 
if you turn over a new leaf, and keep it turned, I'll cook you some taters 
one of these days. I will: fried fish and chips served by S. Gamgee. You 
couldn't say no to that.' 

'Yes, yes we could. Spoiling nice fish, scorching it. Give me fish now, 
and keep nassty chips ! ' 

'Oh you're hopeless,' said Sam. 'Go to sleep!' 

In the end he had to find what he wanted for himself; but he did not 
have to go far, not out of sight of the place where his master lay, still 
sleeping. For a while Sam sat musing, and tending the fire till the water 
boiled. The daylight grew and the air became warm; the dew faded off turf 
and leaf. Soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the 
bunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the time went by. He let them stew 
for close on an hour, testing them now and again with his fork, and tasting 
the broth. 

When he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and 
crept along to Frodo. Frodo half opened his eyes as Sam stood over him, and 
then he wakened from his dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of 
peace. 

'Hullo, Sam! ’ he said. 'Not resting? Is anything wrong? What is the 
time? ’ 

'About a couple of hours after daybreak,’ said Sam, 'and nigh on half 
past eight by Shire clocks, maybe. But nothing's wrong. Though it ain't 
quite what I'd call right: no stock, no onions, no taters. I've got a bit of 
a stew for you, and some broth, Mr. Frodo. Do you good. You'll have to sup 
it in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it's cooled a bit. I haven't 




brought no bowls, nor nothing proper.' 

Frodo yawned and stretched. 'You should have been resting Sam,' he 
said. 'And lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts. But I do feel 
hungry. Hmm! Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed? ' 

'A present from Smjagol,' said Sam: 'a brace o' young coneys; though I 
fancy Gollum's regretting them now. But there's nought to go with them but a 
few herbs.' 

Sam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew 
from the pans, sharing the old fork and spoon. They allowed themselves half 
a piece of the Elvish waybread each. It seemed a feast. 

'Wheew! Gollum! ' Sam called and whistled softly. 'Come on! Still time 
to change your mind. There's some left, if you want to try stewed coney.' 
There was no answer. 

'Oh well, I suppose he's gone off to find something for himself. We'll 
finish it,' said Sam. 

'And then you must take some sleep,' said Frodo. 

'Don't you drop off, while I'm nodding, Mr. Frodo. I don't feel too 
sure of him. There's a good deal of Stinker -the bad Gollum, if you 
understand me-in him still, and it's getting stronger again. Not but what I 
think he'd try to throttle me first now. We don't see eye to eye, and he's 
not pleased with Sam, O no precious, not pleased at all.' 

They finished, and Sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear. As he 
stood up to return, he looked back up the slope. At that moment he saw the 
sun rise out of the reek, or haze, or dark shadow, or whatever it was, that 
lay ever to the east, and it sent its golden beams down upon the trees and 
glades about him. Then he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey, smoke, plain 
to see as it caught the sunlight, rising from a thicket above him. With a 
shock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking-fire, 
which he had neglected to put out. 

'That won't do! Never thought it would show like that! ' he muttered, 
and he started to hurry back. Suddenly he halted and listened. Flad he heard 
a whistle or not? Or was it the call of some strange bird? If it was a 
whistle, it did not come from Frodo's direction. There it went again from 
another place! Sam began to run as well as he could uphill. 

He found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had kindled 
some fern at the edge of the fire, and the fern blazing up had set the 
turves smouldering. Hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire, 




scattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole. Then he crept back to 
Frodo. 

'Did you hear a whistle, and what sounded like an answer? ' he asked. 

'A few minutes back. I hope it was only a bird, but it didn’t sound quite 
like that: more like somebody mimicking a bird-call, I thought. And I'm 
afraid my bit of fire's been smoking. Now if I've gone and brought trouble, 

I'll never forgive myself. Nor won't have a chance, maybe! ' 

'Hush! ' whispered Frodo. 'I thought I heard voices.’ 

The two hobbits trussed their small packs, put them on ready for 
flight, and then crawled deeper into the fern. There they crouched 
listening. 

There was no doubt of the voices. They were speaking low and furtively, 
but they were near, and coming nearer. Then quite suddenly one spoke clearly 
close at hand. 

'Here! Here is where the smoke came from! ' it said. 'Twill be nigh at 
hand. In the fern, no doubt. We shall have it like a coney in a trap. Then 
we shall learn what kind of thing it is.' 

'Aye, and what it knows! ' said a second voice. 

At once four men came striding through the fern from different 
directions. Since flight and hiding were no longer possible, Frodo and Sam 
sprang to their feet, putting back to back and whipping out their small 
swords. 

If they were astonished at what they saw, their captors were even more 
astonished. Four tall Men stood there. Two had spears in their hands with 
broad bright heads. Two had great bows, almost of their own height, and 
great quivers of long green -feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides, 
and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk 
unseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green gauntlets covered their hands, and 
their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which 
were very keen and bright. At once Frodo thought of Boromir, for these Men 
were like him in stature and bearing, and in their manner of speech. 

'We have not found what we sought,’ said one. 'But what have we found? 

f 

'Not Ores,' said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had 
seized when he saw the glitter of Sting in Frodo's hand. 

'Elves? ’ said a third, doubtfully. 

'Nay! Not Elves,' said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the 




chief among them. 'Elves do not walk in Ithilien in these days. And Elves 
are wondrous fair to look upon, or so ’tis said.' 

’Meaning we're not, I take you,' said Sam. 'Thank you kindly. And when 
you've finished discussing us, perhaps you'll say who you are, and why you 
can't let two tired travellers rest.' 

The tall green man laughed grimly. 'I am Faramir, Captain of Gondor,' 
he said. 'But there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the 
Dark Tower, or of the White.' 

'But we are neither,’ said Frodo. 'And travellers we are, whatever 
Captain Faramir may say.' 

'Then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand,' said Faramir. 

'We have a work to do, and this is no time or place for riddling or 
parleying. Come! Where is the third of your company? ' 

'The third? ’ 

'Yes, the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down 
yonder. He had an ill-favoured look. Some spying breed of Ore, I guess, or a 
creature of theirs. But he gave us the slip by some fox-trick.' 

'I do not know where he is,' said Frodo. 'He is only a chance companion 
met upon our road; and I am not answerable for him. If you come on him, 
spare him. Bring him or send him to us. He is only a wretched gangrel 
creature, but I have him under my care for a while. But as for us, we are 
Hobbits of the Shire, far to the North and West, beyond many rivers. Frodo 
son of Drogo is my name, and with me is Samwise son of Hamfast, a worthy 
hobbit in my service. We have come by long ways — out of Rivendell, or 
Imladris as some call it.' Here Faramir started and grew intent. 'Seven 
companions we had: one we lost at Moria, the others we left at Parth Galen 
above Rauros: two of my kin; a Dwarf there was also, and an Elf, and two 
Men. They were Aragorn; and Boromir, who said that he came out of Minas 
Tirith, a city in the South.' 

'Boromir! ' all the four men exclaimed. 

'Boromir son of the Ford Denethor?' said Faramir, and a strange stern 
look came into his face. 'You came with him? That is news indeed, if it be 
true. Know, little strangers, that Boromir son of Denethor was High Warden 
of the White Tower, and our Captain-General: sorely do we miss him. Who are 
you then, and what had you to do with him? Be swift, for the Sun is 
climbing!' 

'Are the riddling words known to you that Boromir brought to Rivendell? 




’ Frodo replied. 

Seek for the Sword that was Broken. 

In Imladris it dwells. 

'The words are known indeed,' said Faramir in astonishment. v It is some 
token of your truth that you also know them.' 

'Aragorn whom I named is the bearer of the Sword that was Broken,' said 
Frodo. 'And we are the Halflings that the rhyme spoke of.' 

'That I see,' said Faramir thoughtfully. 'Or I see that it might be so. 

And what is Isildur's Bane? ' 

'That is hidden,' answered Frodo. 'Doubtless it will be made clear in 
time.’ 

'We must learn more of this,’ said Faramir, 'and know what brings you 
so far east under the shadow of yonder—,' he pointed and said no name. 'But 
not now. We have business in hand. You are in peril, and you would not have 
gone far by field or road this day. There will be hard handstrokes nigh at 
hand ere the day is full. Then death, or swift flight bark to Anduin. I will 
leave two to guard you, for your good and for mine. Wise man trusts not to 
chance-meeting on the road in this land. If I return, I will speak more with 
you.' 

'Farewell!' said Frodo, bowing low. 'Think what you will, I am a friend 
of all enemies of the One Enemy. We would go with you, if we halfling folk 
could hope to serve you, such doughty men and strong as you seem, and if my 
errand permitted it. May the light shine on your swords!' 

'The Halflings are courteous folk, whatever else they be,' said 
Faramir. 'Farewell!' 

The hobbits sat down again, but they said nothing to one another of 
their thoughts and doubts. Close by, just under the dappling shadow of the 
dark bay-trees, two men remained on guard. They took off their masks now and 
again to cool them, as the day-heat grew, and Frodo saw that they were 
goodly men, pale-skinned, dark of hair, with grey eyes and faces sad and 
proud. They spoke together in soft voices, at first using the Common Speech, 
but after the manner of older days, and then changing to another language of 
their own. To his amazement, as he listened Frodo became aware that it was 
the Elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he looked 
at them with wonder, for he knew then that they must be D®nedain of the 
South, men of the line of the Lords of Westernesse. 

After a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious in 




answering. They named themselves Mablung and Damrod, soldiers of Gondor, 
and 

they were Rangers of Ithilien; for they were descended from folk who lived 
in Ithilien at one time, before it was overrun. From such men the Lord 
Denethor chose his forayers, who crossed the Anduin secretly (how or where, 
they would not say) to harry the Ores and other enemies that roamed between 
the Ephel D®ath and the River. 

'It is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of Anduin,' said 
Mablung, ’and we seldom come so far afield. But we have a new errand on this 
journey: we come to ambush the Men of Harad. Curse them! ' 

'Aye, curse the Southrons! ' said Damrod. ' 'Tis said that there were 
dealings of old between Gondor and the kingdoms of the Harad in the Far 
South; though there was never friendship. In those days our bounds were away 
south beyond the mouths of Anduin, and Umbar, the nearest of their realms, 
acknowledged our sway. But that is long since. 'Tis many lives of Men since 
any passed to or fro between us. Now of late we have learned that the Enemy 
has been among them, and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him-they 
were 

ever ready to His will -as have so many also in the East. I doubt not that 
the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed, 
so great is His strength and malice.' 

'But still we will not sit idle and let Him do all as He would,' said 
Mablung. 'These cursed Southrons come now marching up the ancient roads 
to 

swell the hosts of the Dark Tower. Yea, up the very roads that craft of 
Gondor made. And they go ever more heedlessly, we learn, thinking that the 
power of their new master is great enough, so that the mere shadow of His 
hills will protect them. We come to teach them another lesson. Great 
strength of them was reported to us some days ago, marching north. One of 
their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere noon-up on 
the road above, where it passes through the cloven way. The road may pass, 
but they shall not! Not while Faramir is Captain. He leads now in all 
perilous ventures. But his life is charmed, or fate spares him for some 
other end.' 

Their talk died down into a listening silence. All seemed still and 
watchful. Sam, crouched by the edge of the fern-brake, peered out. With his 




keen hobbit-eyes he saw that many more Men were about. He could see 
them 

stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade 
of grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green 
raiment, through grass and brake. All were hooded and masked, and had 
gauntlets on their hands, and were armed like Faramir and his companions. 
Before long they had all passed and vanished. The sun rose till it neared 
the South. The shadows shrank. 

'I wonder where that dratted Gollum is? ' thought Sam, as he crawled 
back into deeper shade. 'He stands a fair chance of being spitted for an 
Ore, or of being roasted by the Yellow Face. But I fancy he’ll look after 
himself.' He lay down beside Frodo and began to doze. 

He woke, thinking that he had heard horns blowing. He sat up. It was 
now high noon. The guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees. 
Suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above, over the 
top of the slope. Sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also, 
but the sound was faint, as if it came out of some distant cave. Then 
presently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand, just above their 
hiding-place. He could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on steel, the 
clang of sword on iron cap, the dull beat of blade on shield; men were 
yelling and screaming, and one clear loud voice was calling Gondorl Gondorl 

'It sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together,’ said Sam 
to Frodo. ’They’re as near as I want them now.’ 

But the noise grew closer. 'They are coming!’ cried Damrod. 'See! Some 
of the Southrons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road. 
There they go! Our men after them, and the Captain leading.’ 

Sam, eager to see more, went now and joined the guards. He scrambled a 
little way up into one of the larger of the bay-trees. For a moment he 
caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running down the slope some way off 
with green-clad warriors leaping after them, hewing them down as they fled. 
Arrows were thick in the air. Then suddenly straight over the rim of their 
sheltering bank, a man fell, crashing through the slender trees, nearly on 
top of them. He came to rest in the fern a few feet away, face downward, 
green arrow-feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar. His 
scarlet robes were tattered, his corslet of overlapping brazen plates was 
rent and hewn, his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with 
blood. His brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword. 




It was Sam's first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not 
like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered 
what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of 
heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home; 
and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace -all in a flash 
of thought which was quickly driven from his mind. For just as Mablung 
stepped towards the fallen body, there was a new noise. Great crying and 
shouting. Amidst it Sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting. And then a 
great thudding and bumping, like huge rams dinning on the ground. 

'Ware! Ware!' cried Damrod to his companion. 'May the Valar turn him 
aside! Mymak! Mymak!' 

To his astonishment and terror, and lasting delight, Sam saw a vast 
shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope. Big as a 
house, much bigger than a house, it looked to him, a grey-clad moving hill. 
Fear and wonder, maybe, enlarged him in the hobbit's eyes, but the Mymak of 
Harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and the like of him does not walk now 
in Middle-earth; his kin that live still in latter days are but memories of 
his girth and majesty. On he came, straight towards the watchers, and then 
swerved aside in the nick of time, passing only a few yards away, rocking 
the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like 
ears spread out, long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to strike, 
his small red eyes raging. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands 
of gold and dripped with blood. His trappings of scarlet and gold flapped 
about him in wild tatters. The ruins of what seemed a very war-tower lay 
upon his heaving back, smashed in his furious passage through the woods; and 
high upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure-the body of a 
mighty warrior, a giant among the Swertings. 

On the great beast thundered, blundering in blind wrath through pool 
and thicket. Arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of 
his flanks. Men of both sides fled before him, but many he overtook and 
crushed to the ground. Soon he was lost to view, still trumpeting and 
stamping far away. What became of him Sam never heard: whether he escaped 
to 

roam the wild for a time, until he perished far from his home or was trapped 
in some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the Great River 
and was swallowed up. 

Sam drew a deep breath. 'An Oliphaunt it was!' he said. 'So there are 




Oliphaunts, and I have seen one. What a life! But no one at home will ever 
believe me. Well, if that's over, I'll have a bit of sleep.' 

'Sleep while you may,' said Mablung. 'But the Captain will return, if 
he is unhurt; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly. We shall be pursued 
as soon as news of our deed reaches the Enemy, and that will not be long.' 

'Go quietly when you must!’ said Sam. 'No need to disturb my sleep. I 
was walking all night.' 

Mablung laughed. 'I do not think the Captain will leave you here, 
Master Samwise,’ he said. 'But you shall see.' 




Chapter 5 . The Window on the West 



It seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke 
to find that it was late afternoon and Faramir had come back. He had brought 
many men with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered 
on the slope nearby, two or three hundred strong. They sat in a wide 
semicircle, between the arms of which Faramir was seated on the ground, 
while Frodo stood before him. It looked strangely like the trial of a 
prisoner. 

Sam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to him, and 
he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear 
all that was going on. He watched and listened intently, ready to dash to 
his master's aid if needed. He could see Faramir's face, which was now 
unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his 
searching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo. 

Sam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with Frodo's 
account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the 
Company that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir; and where he 
was now going. In particular he returned often to Isildur's Bane. Plainly he 
saw that Frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance. 

'But it was at the coming of the Halfling that Isildur's Bane should 
waken, or so one must read the words,' he insisted. 'If then you are the 
Halfling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may 
be, to the Council of which you speak, and there Boromir saw it. Do you deny 
it? ' 

Frodo made no answer. 'So! ' said Faramir. V I wish then to learn from 
you more of it; for what concerns Boromir concerns me. An ore-arrow slew 
Isildur, so far as old tales tell. But ore-arrows are plenty, and the sight 
of one would not be taken as a sign of Doom by Boromir of Gondor. Had you 
this thing in keeping? It is hidden, you say; but is not that because you 
choose to hide it? ' 

'No, not because I choose,' answered Frodo. v It does not belong to me. 

It does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any could claim 
it, it would be Aragorn son of Arathorn, whom I named, the leader of our 
Company from Moria to Rauros.' 




'Why so, and not Boromir, prince of the City that the sons of Elendil 
founded? ' 

'Because Aragorn is descended in direct lineage, father to father, from 
Isildur Elendil's son himself. And the sword that he bears was Elendil's 
sword.' 

A murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men. Some cried 
aloud: 'The sword of Elendil! The sword of Elendil comes to Minas Tirith! 
Great tidings! ' But Faramir's face was unmoved. 

'Maybe,' he said. 'But so great a claim will need to be established and 
clear proofs will be required, should this Aragorn ever come to Minas 
Tirith. He had not come, nor any of your Company, when I set out six days 
ago.' 

'Boromir was satisfied of that claim,' said Frodo. 'Indeed, if Boromir 
were here, he would answer all your questions. And since he was already at 
Rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you 
return, you may soon learn the answers there. My part in the Company was 
known to him, as to all the others, for it was appointed to me by Elrond of 
Imladris himself before the whole Council. On that errand I came into this 
country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the Company. Yet those 
who claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.' 

Frodo's tone was proud, whatever he felt, and Sam approved of it; but 
it did not appease Faramir. 

'So!' he said. 'You bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home, 
and let you be. Boromir will tell all, when he comes. When he comes, say 
you! Were you a friend of Boromir?’ 

Vividly before Frodo's mind came the memory of Boromir's assault upon 
him, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir's eyes watching him grew harder. 
'Boromir was a valiant member of our Company ' said Frodo at length. 'Yes, I 
was his friend, for my part.' 

Faramir smiled grimly. 'Then you would grieve to learn that Boromir is 
dead? ' 

'I would grieve indeed,' said Frodo. Then catching the look in 
Faramir's eyes, he faltered. 'Dead?' he said. 'Do you mean that he is dead, 
and that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with 
me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?' 

'I would not snare even an ore with a falsehood,' said Faramir. 

'How then did he die, and how do you know of it? Since you say that 




none of the Company had reached the city when you left.' 

'As to the manner of his death, I had hoped that his friend and 
companion would tell me how it was.' 

'But he was alive and strong when we parted. And he lives still for all 
that I know. Though surely there are many perils in the world.' 

'Many indeed,' said Faramir, 'and treachery not the least.’ 

Sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this 
conversation. These last words were more than he could bear, and bursting 
into the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master's side. 

'Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he said, 'but this has gone on long 
enough. Tie's no right to talk to you so. After all you've gone through, as 
much for his good and all these great Men as for anyone else. 

'See here, Captain! ' He planted himself squarely in front of Faramir 
his hands on his hips, and a look on his face as if he was addressing a 
young hobbit who had offered him what he called 'sauce' when questioned 
about visits to the orchard. There was some murmuring, but also some grins 
on the faces of the men looking on: the sight of their Captain sitting on 
the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling 
with wrath, was one beyond their experience. 'See here! ’ he said. 'What are 
you driving at? Let's come to the point before all the Ores of Mordor come 
down on us! If you think my master murdered this Boromir and then ran away, 
you've got no sense; but say it, and have done! And then let us know what 
you mean to do about it. But it's a pity that folk as talk about fighting 
the Enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without 
interfering. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got 
a new friend, he would.' 

'Patience!' said Faramir, but without anger. 'Do not speak before your 
master, whose wit is greater than yours. And I do not need any to teach me 
of our peril. Even so, I spare a brief time, in order to judge justly in a 
hard matter. Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you long ago. For I 
am commanded to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of the 
Lord of Gondor. But I do not slay man or beast needlessly, and not gladly 
even when it is needed. Neither do I talk in vain. So be comforted. Sit by 
your master, and be silent! ’ 

Sam sat down heavily with a red face. Faramir turned to Frodo again: 

'You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of death 
have many wings. Night oft brings news to near kindred, 'tis said. Boromir 




was my brother.' 

A shadow of sorrow passed over his face. 'Do you remember aught of 
special mark that the Lord Boromir bore with him among his gear?' 

Frodo thought for a moment, fearing some further trap, and wondering 
how this debate would turn in the end. He had hardly saved the Ring from the 
proud grasp of Boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men, 
warlike 

and strong, he did not know. Yet he felt in his heart that Faramir, though 
he was much like his brother in looks, was a man less self-regarding, both 
sterner and wiser. 'I remember that Boromir bore a horn,' he said at last. 

'You remember well, and as one who has in truth seen him,' said 
Faramir. 'Then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye: a great horn of the 
wild ox of the East, bound with silver, and written with ancient characters. 

That horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it 
is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of Gondor, as 
the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded. 

'Five days ere I set out on this venture, eleven days ago at about this 
hour of the day, I heard the blowing of that horn: from the northward it 
seemed, but dim, as if it were but an echo in the mind. A boding of ill we 
thought it, my father and I, for no tidings had we heard of Boromir since he 
went away, and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass. And on the third 
night after another and a stranger thing befell me. 

'I sat at night by the waters of Anduin, in the grey dark under the 
young pale moon, watching the ever -moving stream; and the sad reeds were 
rustling. So do we ever watch the shores nigh Osgiliath, which our enemies 
now partly hold, and issue from it to harry our lands. But that night all 
the world slept at the midnight hour. Then I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a 
boat floating on the water, glimmering grey, a small boat of a strange 
fashion with a high prow, and there was none to row or steer it. 

'An awe fell on me, for a pale light was round it. But I rose and went 
to the bank, and began to walk out into the stream, for I was drawn towards 
it. Then the boat turned towards me, and stayed its pace, and floated slowly 
by within my hand's reach, yet I durst not handle it. It waded deep, as if 
it were heavily burdened, and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze 
that it was almost filled with clear water, from which came the light; and 
lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep. 

'A broken sword was on his knee. I saw many wounds on him. It was 




Boromir, my brother, dead. I knew his gear, his sword, his beloved face. One 
thing only I missed: his horn. One thing only I knew not: a fair belt, as it 
were of linked golden leaves, about his waist. Boromir! I cried. Where is 
thy horn? Whither goest thou? O Boromir! But he was gone. The boat turned 
into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night. Dreamlike it was. 
and yet no dream, for there was no waking. And I do not doubt that he is 
dead and has passed down the River to the Sea.' 

'Alas!' said Frodo. That was indeed Boromir as I knew him. For the 
golden belt was given to him in Lothlurien by the Lady Galadriel. She it was 
that clothed us as you see us, in elven-grey. This brooch is of the same 
workmanship.' Fie touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak 
beneath his throat. 

Faramir looked closely at it. Tt is beautiful,' he said. 'Yes, 'tis 
work of the same craft. So then you passed through the Land of Lurien? 
Laurelindurenan it was named of old, but long now it has lain beyond the 
knowledge of Men,' he added softly, regarding Frodo with a new wonder in his 
eyes. 'Much that was strange about you I begin now to understand. Will you 
not tell me more? For it is a bitter thought that Boromir died, within sight 
of the land of his home.' 

'No more can I say than I have said,' answered Frodo. 'Though your tale 
fills me with foreboding. A vision it was that you saw, I think, and no 
more, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be. Unless indeed it 
is some lying trick of the Enemy. I have seen the faces of fair warriors of 
old laid in sleep beneath the pools of the Dead Marshes, or seeming so by 
his foul arts.’ 

'Nay, it was not so,' said Faramir. 'For his works fill the heart with 
loathing; but my heart was filled with grief and pity.' 

'Yet how could such a thing have happened in truth? ' asked Frodo. 'For 
no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from Tol Brandir; and 
Boromir purposed to go home across the Entwash and the fields of Rohan. 

And 

yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in 
the boiling pools, though laden with water? ' 

'I know not,' said Faramir. 'But whence came the boat? ' 

'From Lurien,' said Frodo. 'In three such boats we rowed down Anduin to 
the Falls. They also were of elven-work.' 

'You passed through the Hidden Land,' said Faramir, 'but it seems that 




you little understood its power. If Men have dealings with the Mistress of 
Magic who dwells in the Golden Wood, then they may look for strange things 
to follow. For it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of 
this Sun, and few of old came thence unchanged, 'tis said. 

' Boromir , O Boromir!' he cried. "What did she say to you, the Lady that 
dies not? What did she see? What woke in your heart then? Why went you ever 
to Laurelindurenan, and came not by your own road, upon the horses of 
Rohan 

riding home in the morning?' 

Then turning again to Frodo, he spoke in a quiet voice once more. To 
those questions I guess that you could make some answer, Frodo son of Drogo. 
But not here or now. maybe. But lest you still should think my tale a 
vision, I will tell you this. The horn of Boromir at least returned in 
truth, and not in seeming. The horn came, but it was cloven in two, as it 
were by axe or sword. The shards came severally to shore: one was found 
among the reeds where watchers of Gondor lay, northwards below the infalls 
of the Entwash; the other was found spinning on the flood by one who had an 
errand in the water. Strange chances, but murder will out, 'tis said. 

'And now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of 
Denethor, sitting in his high chair, waiting for news. And you can tell me 
nothing of the cleaving of the horn? ' 

'No, I did not know of it,' said Frodo. 'But the day when you heard it 
blowing, if your reckoning is true, was the day when we parted, when I and 
my servant left the Company. And now your tale fills me with dread. For if 
Boromir was then in peril and was slain, I must fear that all my companions 
perished too. And they were my kindred and my friends. 

'Will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go? I am weary, and 
full of grief, and afraid. But I have a deed to do, or to attempt, before I 
too am slain. And the more need of haste, if we two halflings are all that 
remain of our fellowship. 

'Go back, Faramir, valiant Captain of Gondor, and defend your city 
while you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.' 

'For me there is no comfort in our speech together,' said Faramir; 'but 
you surely draw from it more dread than need be. Unless the people of Lurien 
themselves came to him, who arrayed Boromir as for a funeral? Not Ores or 
servants of the Nameless. Some of your Company, I guess, live still. 

'But whatever befell on the North March, you, Frodo, I doubt no longer. 




If hard days have made me any judge of Men’s words and faces, then I may 
make a guess at Halflings! Though,’ and now he smiled, There is something 
strange about you, Frodo, an elvish air, maybe. But more lies upon our words 
together than I thought at first. I should now take you back to Minas Tirith 
to answer there to Denethor, and my life will justly be forfeit, if I now 
choose a course that proves ill for my city. So I will not decide in haste 
what is to be done. Yet we must move hence without more delay.' 

He sprang to his feet and issued some orders. At once the men who were 
gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and 
that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. Soon only 
Mablung and Damrod remained. 

'Now you, Frodo and Samwise, will come with me and my guards,' said 
Faramir. v You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. 
It will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this 
affray than it has been yet. And you cannot, I think, go far today in any 
case, for you are weary. And so are we. We are going now to a secret place 
we have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. The Ores and spies of the 
Enemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even 
against many. There we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. In 
the morning I will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.' 

There was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or 
order. It seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray 
of the men of Gondor had made a journey in Ithilien more dangerous than 
ever. 

They set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and Faramir 
with Frodo and Sam behind. Skirting the hither side of the pool where the 
hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed 
into green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and 
westwards. 

While they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed 
voices. 

'I broke off our speech together,' said Faramir, 'not only because time 
pressed, as Master Samwise had reminded me, but also because we were 
drawing 

near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men. It was 
for that reason that I turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be 
Isildur's Bane. You were not wholly frank with me, Frodo.' 




'I told no lies, and of the truth all I could,' said Frodo. 

'I do not blame you,' said Faramir. 'You spoke with skill in a hard 
place, and wisely, it seemed to me. But I learned or guessed more from you 
than your words said. You were not friendly with Boromir, or you did not 
part in friendship. You, and Master Samwise, too, I guess have some 
grievance. Now I loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet I 
knew him well. Isildur's Bane — I would hazard that Isildur's Bane lay 
between you and was a cause of contention in your Company. Clearly it is a 
mighty heirloom of some sort, and such things do not breed peace among 
confederates, not if aught may be learned from ancient tales. Do I not hit 
near the mark?' 

'Near,' said Frodo, 'but not in the gold. There was no contention in 
our Company, though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from 
the 

Emyn Muil. But be that as it may, ancient tales teach us also the peril of 
rash words concerning such things as — heirlooms.' 

'Ah, then it is as I thought: your trouble was with Boromir alone. Fie 
wished this thing brought to Minas Tirith. Alas! it is a crooked fate that 
seals your lips who saw him last, and holds from me that which I long to 
know: what was in his heart and thought in his latest hours. Whether he 
erred or no, of this I am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. His 
face was more beautiful even than in life. 

'But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about Isildur's Bane. Forgive 
me! It was unwise in such an hour and place. I had not had time for thought. 
We had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough to fill my mind. But 
even as I spoke with you, I drew nearer to the mark, and so deliberately 
shot wider. For you must know that much is still preserved of ancient lore 
among the Rulers of the city that is not spread abroad. We of my house are 
not of the line of Elendil. though the blood of N®menor is in us. For we 
reckon back our line to Mardil, the good steward, who ruled in the king's 
stead when he went away to war. And that was King Edrnur, last of the line 
of Anbrion, and childless, and he came never back. And the stewards have 
governed the city since that day, though it was many generations of Men ago. 

'And this I remember of Boromir as a boy, when we together learned the 
tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him 
that his father was not king. "How many hundreds of years needs it to make a 
steward a king, if the king returns not? " he asked. "Few years, maybe, in 




other places of less royalty," my father answered. "In Gondor ten thousand 
years would not suffice." Alas! poor Boromir. Does that not tell you 
something of him? ' 

'It does,' said Frodo. 'Yet always he treated Aragorn with honour.' 

'I doubt it not,' said Faramir. 'If he were satisfied of Aragorn's 
claim as you say, he would greatly reverence him. But the pinch has not yet 
come. They had not yet reached Minas Tirith or become rivals in her wars. 

'But I stray. We in the house of Denethor know much ancient lore by 
long tradition, and there are moreover in our treasuries many things 
preserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments, yea, and on stone, 
and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers characters. Some none can now 
read; and for the rest, few ever unlock them. I can read a little in them, 
for I have had teaching. It was these records that brought the Grey Pilgrim 
to us. I first saw him when I was a child, and he has been twice or thrice 
since then.’ 

'The Grey Pilgrim? ' said Frodo. 'Had he a name?' 

'Mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion,' said Faramir, 'and he was 
content. Many are my names in many countries , he said. Mithrandir among the 
Elves, Tharkyn to the Dwarves; Olurin I was in my youth in the West that is 
forgotten, in the South Incbnus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go 
not.' 

'Gandalf!' said Frodo. 'I thought it was he. Gandalf the Grey dearest 
of counsellors. Leader of our Company. He was lost in Moria.' 

'Mithrandir was lost! ' said Faramir. 'An evil fate seems to have 
pursued your fellowship. It is hard indeed to believe that one of so great 
wisdom, and of power — for many wonderful things he did among us — could 
perish, and so much lore be taken from the world. Are you sure of this, and 
that he did not just leave you and depart where he would? ' 

'Alas! yes,' said Frodo. 'I saw him fall into the abyss.' 

'I see that there is some great tale of dread in this.' said Faramir 
'which perhaps you may tell me in the evening -time. This Mithrandir was, I 
now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done 
in our time. Had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of 
our dream, he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger. 
Yet, maybe, he would not have done so, and the journey of Boromir was 
doomed. Mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal 
his purposes. He got leave of Denethor, how I do not know, to look at the 




secrets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would teach 
(and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would question us above all 
else concerning the Great Battle that was fought upon Dagorlad in the 
beginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not name was overthrown. And 
he was 

eager for stories of Isildur, though of him we had less to tell; for nothing 
certain was ever known among us of his end.' 

Now Faramir's voice sank to a whisper. 'But this much I learned or 
guessed, and I have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that Isildur took 
somewhat from the hand of the Unnamed, ere he went away from Gondor, 
never 

to be seen among mortal men again. Here I thought was the answer to 
Mithrandir's questioning. But it seemed then a matter that concerned only 
the seekers after ancient learning. Nor when the riddling words of our dream 
were debated among us, did I think of Isildur's Bane as being this same 
thing. For Isildur was ambushed and slain by ore-arrows, according to the 
only legend that we knew, and Mithrandir had never told me more. 

'What in truth this Thing is I cannot yet guess; but some heirloom of 
power and peril it must be. A fell weapon, perchance, devised by the Dark 
Ford. If it were a thing that gave advantage in battle. I can well believe 
that Boromir, the proud and fearless, often rash, ever anxious for the 
victory of Minas Tirith (and his own glory therein), might desire such a 
thing and be allured by it. Alas that ever he went on that errand! I should 
have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward, as 
being the older and the hardier (both true), and he would not be stayed. 

'But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it layby the 
highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, 
so, using the weapon of the Dark Ford for her good and my glory. No. I do 
not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.' 

'Neither did the Council,' said Frodo. 'Nor do 1. 1 would have nothing 
to do with such matters.' 

'For myself,’ said Faramir, ’I would see the White Tree in flower again 
in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in 
peace: Minas Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful 
as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even 
a kind mistress of willing slaves. War must be, while we defend our lives 
against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword 




for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his 
glory. I love only that which they defend: the city of the Men of N®menor; 
and I would have her loved for her memory, her ancientry, her beauty, and 
her present wisdom. Not feared, save as men may fear the dignity of a man, 
old and wise. 

'So fear me not! I do not ask you to tell me more. I do not even ask 
you to tell me whether I now speak nearer the mark. But if you will trust 
me, it may be that I can advise you in your present quest, whatever that 
be-yes, and even aid you.' 

Frodo made no answer. Almost he yielded to the desire for help and 
counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair, 
all that was in his mind. But something held him back. His heart was heavy 
with fear and sorrow: if he and Sam were indeed, as seemed likely, all that 
was now left of the Nine Walkers, then he was in sole command of the secret 
of their errand. Better mistrust undeserved than rash words. And the memory 
of Boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in 
him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to 
his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin. 

They walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green 
shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many 
birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the 
evergreen woods of Ithilien. 

Sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and 
at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft 
woodland noises about them. One thing he had noted, that in all the talk the 
name of Gollum had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was 
too much to hope that he would never hear it again. He soon became aware 
also that though they walked alone, there were many men close at hand: not 
only Damrod and Mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others 
on either side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place. 

Once, looking suddenly back, as if some prickle of the skin told him 
that he was watched from behind, he thought he caught a brief glimpse of a 
small dark shape slipping behind a tree-trunk. He opened his mouth to speak 
and shut it again. Tm not sure of it,' he said to himself, 'and why should 
I remind them of the old villain, if they choose to forget him? I wish I 
could!' 

So they passed on, until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began 




to fall more steeply. Then they turned aside again, to the right, and came 
quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that 
trickled far above out of the round pool, now grown to a swift torrent, 
leaping down over many stones in a deep-cloven bed, overhung with ilex and 
dark box- woods. Looking west they could see, below them in a haze of light, 
lowlands and broad meads, and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide 
waters of the Anduin. 

'Here, alas! I must do you a discourtesy,' said Faramir. "I hope you 
will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as 
not to slay you or to bind you. But it is a command that no stranger, not 
even one of Rohan that fights with us, shall see the path we now go with 
open eyes. I must blindfold you.’ 

'As you will,' said Frodo. ’Even the Elves do likewise at need, and 
blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair Lothlurien. Gimli the dwarf took 
it ill, but the hobbits endured it.' 

'It is to no place so fair that I shall lead you,' said Faramir. 'But I 
am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.' 

He called softly and immediately Mablung and Damrod stepped out of the 
trees and came back to him. 'Blindfold these guests,' said Faramir. 
'Securely, but not so as to discomfort them. Do not tie their hands. They 
will give their word not to try and see. I could trust them to shut their 
eyes of their own accord, but eyes will blink, if the feet stumble. Lead 
them so that they do not falter.' 

With green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes and 
drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each 
one by the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo and Sam knew of this 
last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little 
they found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so 
narrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; 
their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their 
shoulders. Now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from 
their feet for a while, and then set down again. Always the noise of the 
running water was on their right hand, and it grew nearer and louder. At 
length they were halted. Quickly Mablung and Damrod turned them about, 
several times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed upwards a 
little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint. Then 
they were picked up and carried down, down many steps, and round a corner. 




Suddenly they heard the water again, loud now, rushing and splashing. All 
round them it seemed, and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. 

At last they were set on their feet once more. For a moment they stood so, 
half fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no one spoke. 

Then came the voice of Faramir close behind. 'Let them see! ' he said. 

The scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back, and they blinked and 
gasped. 

They stood on a wet floor of polished stone, the doorstep, as it were, 
of a rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them. But in front a thin 
veil of water was hung, so near that Frodo could have put an outstretched 
arm into it. It faced westward. The level shafts of the setting sun behind 
beat upon it, and the red light was broken into many flickering beams of 
ever-changing colour. It was as if they stood at the window of some 
elven-tower, curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold, and ruby, 
sapphire and amethyst, all kindled with an unconsuming fire. 

'At least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you for 
your patience,' said Faramir. 'This is the Window of the Sunset, Henneth 
Annyn, fairest of all the falls of Ithilien, land of many fountains. Few 
strangers have ever seen it. But there is no kingly hall behind to match it. 

Enter now and see ! ’ 

Even as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water. 

They turned and passed under the low forbidding arch. At once they found 
themselves in a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with an uneven stooping roof. 
A few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls. 
Many men were already there. Others were still coming in by twos and threes 
through a dark narrow door on one side. As their eyes grew accustomed to the 
gloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was 
filled with great store of arms and victuals. 

'Well, here is our refuge,' said Faramir. 'Not a place of great ease 
but here you may pass the night in peace. It is dry at least, and there is 
food, though no fire. At one time the water flowed down through this cave 
and out of the arch, but its course was changed further up the gorge, by 
workmen of old, and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over 
the rocks far above. All the ways into this grot were then sealed against 
the entry of water or aught else, all save one. There are now but two ways 
out: that passage yonder by which you entered blindfold, and through the 
Window-curtain into a deep bowl filled with knives of stone. Now rest a 




while, until the evening meal is set.' 

The hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on, if 
they wished. Meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in 
orderly quickness. Light tables were taken from the walls and set up on 
trestles and laden with gear. This was plain and unadorned for the most 
part, but all well and fairly, made: round platters, bowls and dishes of 
glazed brown clay or turned box-wood, smooth and clean. Here and there was a 
cup or basin of polished bronze; and a goblet of plain silver was set by the 
Captain’s seat in the middle of the inmost table. 

Faramir went about among the men, questioning each as he came in, in a 
soft voice. Some came back from the pursuit of the Southrons; others, left 
behind as scouts near the road, came in latest. All the Southrons had been 
accounted for, save only the great mymak: what happened to him none could 
say. Of the enemy no movement could be seen; not even an ore-spy was 
abroad. 

'You saw and heard nothing, Anborn?' Faramir asked of the latest comer. 

'Well, no, lord,’ said the man. 'No Ore at least. But I saw, or thought 
I saw, something a little strange. It was getting deep dusk, when the eyes 
make things greater than they should be. So perhaps it may have been no more 
than a squirrel.’ Sam pricked up his ears at this. ’Yet if so, it was a 
black squirrel, and I saw no tail. ’Twas like a shadow on the ground, and it 
whisked behind a tree-trunk when I drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as 
any squirrel could. You will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose, 
and it seemed no more, so I tried no arrow. It was too dark for sure 
shooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a 
twinkling. But I stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then I 
hastened back. I thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as I 
turned away. A large squirrel, maybe. Perhaps under the shadow of the 
Unnamed some of the beasts of Mirkwood are wandering hither to our 
woods. 

They have black squirrels there, ’tis said.’ 

'Perhaps,' said Faramir. 'But that would be an ill omen, if it were so. 

We do not want the escapes of Mirkwood in Ithilien.’ Sam fancied that he 
gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but Sam said nothing. 

For a while he and Frodo lay back and watched the torchlight, and the men 
moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices. Then suddenly Frodo fell 
asleep. 




Sam struggled with himself, arguing this way and that. 'He may be all 
right,' he thought, ’and then he may not. Fair speech may hide a foul 
heart.' He yawned. V I could sleep for a week, and I'd be better for it. And 
what can I do, if I do keep awake, me all alone, and all these great Men 
about? Nothing, Sam Gamgee; but you've got to keep awake all the same.' And 
somehow he managed it. The light faded from the cave door, and the grey veil 
of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow. Always the sound 
of the water went on, never changing its note, morning or evening or night. 

It murmured and whispered of sleep. Sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes. 

Now more torches were being lit. A cask of wine was broached. Storage 
barrels were being opened. Men were fetching water from the fall. Some were 
laving their hands in basins. A wide copper bowl and a white cloth were 
brought to Faramir and he washed. 

'Wake our guests,' he said, 'and take them water. It is time to eat.’ 

Frodo sat up and yawned and stretched. Sam, not used to being waited 
on, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin of 
water before him. 

'Put it on the ground, master, if you please! ' he said. 'Easier for me 
and you.' Then to the astonishment and amusement of the Men he plunged his 
head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears. 

'Is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper? ' said 
the man who waited on the hobbits. 

'No, before breakfast,' said Sam. 'But if you're short of sleep cold 
water on the neck's like rain on a wilted lettuce. There! Now I can keep 
awake long enough to eat a bit.' 

They were led then to seats beside Faramir: barrels covered with pelts 
and high enough above the benches of the Men for their convenience. Before 
they ate, Faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of 
silence. Faramir signed to Frodo and Sam that they should do likewise. 

'So we always do.' he said, as they sat down: 'we look towards N®menor 
that was, and beyond to Elvenhome that is, and to that which is beyond 
Elvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such custom at meat? ’ 

'No,' said Frodo, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. 'But if we 
are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise and thank 
him.' 

'That we do also,' said Faramir. 

After so long journeying and camping, and days spent XJn the lonely 




wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow 
wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and 
dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and 
plates. Neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything that was offered, nor a 
second, nor indeed a third helping. The wine coursed in their veins and 
tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since 
they left the land of Lurien. 

When all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, 
partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought there. 

A little earthenware lamp burned in a niche. 

'You may soon desire to sleep,' he said, ’and especially good Samwise, 
who would not close his eyes before he ate — whether for fear of blunting 
the edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, I do not know. But it is not 
good to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. Let us talk a 
while. On your journey from Rivendell there must have been many things to 
tell. And you, too, would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the 
lands where you now are. Tell me of Boromir my brother, and of old 
Mithrandir, and of the fair people of Lothlurien.' 

Frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the 
food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. Sam 
was beaming and humming to himself, but when Frodo spoke he was at first 
content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of 
agreement. 

Frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the 
quest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part 
Boromir had played in all their adventures, with the wolves of the wild, in 
the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell. 
Faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge. 

'It must have irked Boromir to run from Ores,’ he said, 'or even from 
the fell thing you name, the Balrog — even though he was the last to 
leave.' 

'Fie was the last,' said Frodo, 'but Aragorn was forced to lead us. Fie 
alone knew the way after Gandalf s fall. But had there not been us lesser 
folk to care for, I do not think that either he or Boromir would have fled.' 

'Maybe, it would have been better had Boromir fallen there with 
Mithrandir,' said Faramir, 'and not gone on to the fate that waited above 
the falls of Rauros.' 




'Maybe. But tell me now of your own fortunes,' said Frodo, turning the 
matter aside once again. 'For I would learn more of Minas Ithil and 
Osgiliath, and Minas Tirith the long-enduring. What hope have you for that 
city in your long war? ' 

'What hope have we? ' said Faramir. 'It is long since we had any hope. 

The sword of Elendil, if it returns indeed, may rekindle it, but I do not 
think that it will do more than put off the evil day, unless other help 
unlooked-for also comes, from Elves or Men. For the Enemy increases and we 
decrease. We are a failing people, a springless autumn. 

'The Men of N®menor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward 
regions of the Great Lands, but for the most part they fell into evils and 
follies. Many became enamoured of the Darkness and the black arts; some 
were 

given over wholly to idleness and ease, and some fought among themselves, 
until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men. 

'It is not said that evil arts were ever practised in Gondor, or that 
the Nameless One was ever named in honour there; and the old wisdom and 
beauty brought out of the West remained long in the realm of the sons of 
Elendil the Fair, and they linger there still. Yet even so it was Gondor 
that brought about its own decay, falling by degrees into dotage, and 
thinking that the Enemy was asleep, who was only banished not destroyed. 

'Death was ever present, because the N®menoreans still, as they had in 
their old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered after endless life unchanging. 

Kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living, and counted old 
names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. Childless 
lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in secret chambers withered men 
compounded strong elixirs, or in high cold towers asked questions of the 
stars. And the last king of the line of Anbrion had no heir. 

'But the stewards were wiser and more fortunate. Wiser, for they 
recruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea -coast, 
and from the hardy mountaineers of Ered Nimrais. And they made a truce with 
the proud peoples of the North, who often had assailed us, men of fierce 
valour, but our kin from afar off, unlike the wild Easterlings or the cruel 
Haradrim. 

'So it came to pass in the days of Cirion the Twelfth Steward (and my 
father is the sit and twentieth) that they rode to our aid and at the great 
Field of Celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern 




provinces. These are the Rohirrim, as we name them, masters of horses, and 
we ceded to them the fields of Calenardhon that are since called Rohan; for 
that province had long been sparsely peopled. And they became our allies, 
and have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need, and guarding our 
northern marches and the Gap of Rohan. 

'Of our lore and manners they have learned what they would, and their 
lords speak our speech at need; yet for the most part they hold by the ways 
of their own fathers and to their own memories, and they speak among 
themselves their own North tongue. And we love them: tall men and fair 
women, valiant both alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed, and strong; they 
remind us of the youth of Men, as they were in the Elder Days. Indeed it is 
said by our lore-masters that they have from of old this affinity with us 
that they are come from those same Three Houses of Men as were the 
N®menoreans in their beginning not from Hador the Goldenhaired, the 
Elf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his sons and people as went not over Sea 
into the West, refusing the call. 

'For so we reckon Men in our lore, calling them the High, or Men of the 
West, which were N®menoreans; and the Middle Peoples, Men of the 
Twilight, 

such as are the Rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far in the North; 
and the Wild, the Men of Darkness. 

'Yet now, if the Rohirrim are grown in some ways more like to us, 
enhanced in arts and gentleness, we too have become more like to them, and 
can scarce claim any longer the title High. We are become Middle Men, of the 
Twilight, but with memory of other things. For as the Rohirrim do, we now 
love war and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end; 
and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and 
knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior, 
nonetheless, above men of other crafts. Such is the need of our days. So 
even was my brother, Boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was 
accounted the best man in Gondor. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of 
Minas Tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into 
battle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn.' Faramir sighed and fell 
silent for a while. 

'You don't say much in all your tales about the Elves, sir,' said Sam, 
suddenly plucking up courage. He had noted that Faramir seemed to refer to 
Elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and 




wine, had won Sam's respect and quieted his suspicions. 

'No indeed, Master Samwise,' said Faramir, 'for I am not learned in 
Elven-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we have changed, 
declining from N®menor to Middle-earth. For as you may know, if 
Mithrandir 

was your companion and you have spoken with Elrond, the Edain, the Fathers 
of the N®menoreans, fought beside the Elves in the first wars, and were 
rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the Sea, within sight of 
Elvenhome. But in Middle-earth Men and Elves became estranged in the days 
of 

darkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time in which 
each kind walked further down their sundered roads. Men now fear and 
misdoubt the Elves, and yet know little of them. And we of Gondor grow like 
other Men, like the men of Rohan; for even they, who are the foes of the 
Dark Lord, shun the Elves and speak of the Golden Wood with dread. 

'Yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the Elves 
when they may, and ever and anon one will go in secret to Lurien, seldom to 
return. Not I. For I deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek 
out the Elder People. Yet I envy you that have spoken with the White Lady.’ 

'The Lady of Lurien! Galadriel!' cried Sam. 'You should see her indeed 
you should, sir. I am only a hobbit, and gardening's my job at home, sir, if 
you understand me, and I'm not much good at poetry — not at making it: a 
bit of a comic rhyme, perhaps, now and again, you know, but not real poetry 
— so I can't tell you what I mean. It ought to be sung. You'd have to get 
Strider, Aragorn that is, or old Mr. Bilbo, for that. But I wish I could 
make a song about her. Beautiful she is, sir! Lovely! Sometimes like a great 
tree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender 
like. Hard as di'monds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight, cold as frost 
in the stars. Proud and far-off as a snow -mountain, and as merry as any lass 
I ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime. But that's a lot o' 
nonsense, and all wide of my mark.' 

'Then she must be lovely indeed,' said Faramir. 'Perilously fair.' 

'I don't know about perilous ,' said Sam. 'It strikes me that folk takes 
their peril with them into Lurien, and finds it there because they've 
brought it. But perhaps you could call her perilous, because she's so strong 
in herself. You, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on a 
rock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a river. But neither rock nor 




river would be to blame. Now Boro — ' He stopped and went red in the face. 

'Yes? Now Boromir you would say? ' said Faramir. 'What would you say? 
He took his peril with him? ’ 

'Yes sir, begging your pardon, and a fine man as your brother was if I 
may say so. But you've been warm on the scent all along. Now I watched 
Boromir and listened to him, from Rivendell all down the road — looking 
after my master, as you'll understand, and not meaning any harm to Boromir 
— and it's my opinion that in Lurien he first saw clearly what I guessed 
sooner: what he wanted. From the moment he first saw it he wanted the 
Enemy's Ring! ' 

'Sam! ' cried Frodo aghast. He had fallen deep into his own thoughts 
for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late. 

'Save me! ' said Sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. 'There I 
go again! When ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the 
Gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. O dear, O dear! 

'Now look here, sir! ' He turned, facing up to Faramir with all the 
courage that he could muster. 'Don't you go taking advantage of my master 
because his servant's no better than a fool. You've spoken very handsome all 
along, put me off my guard, talking of Elves and all. But handsome is as 
handsome does we say. Now's a chance to show your quality.' 

'So it seems,' said Faramir, slowly and very softly, with a strange 
smile. 'So that is the answer to all the riddles! The One Ring that was 
thought to have perished from the world. And Boromir tried to take it by 
force? And you escaped? And ran all the way — to me! And here in the wild I 
have you: two halflings, and a host of men at my call, and the Ring of 
Rings. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor, 
to show his quality! Ha!’ He stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes 
glinting. 

Frodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side 
with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. There was a 
silence. All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in 
wonder. But Faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly, 
and then suddenly became grave again. 

'Alas for Boromir! It was too sore a trial! ' he said. 'How you have 
increased my sorrow, you two strange wanderers from a far country, bearing 
the peril of Men! But you are less judges of Men than I of Halflings. We are 
truth-speakers, we men of Gondor. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die 




in the attempt. Not if I found it on the highway would I take it I said. 

Even if I were such a man as to desire this thing, and even though I knew 
not clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should take those 
words as a vow, and be held by them. 

'But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough to know that there are 
some perils from which a man must flee. Sit at peace! And be comforted, 
Samwise. If you seem to have stumbled, think that it was fated to be so. 

Your heart is shrewd as well as faithful, and saw clearer than your eyes. 

For strange though it may seem, it was safe to declare this to me. It may 
even help the master that you love. It shall turn to his good, if it is in 
my power. So be comforted. But do not even name this thing again aloud. Once 
is enough.' 

The hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. Men turned 
back to their drink and their talk, perceiving that their captain had had 
some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over. 

'Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another,' said Faramir. 'If 
you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others' asking, then you have 
pity and honour from me. And I marvel at you: to keep it hid and not to use 
it. You are a new people and a new world to me. Are all your kin of like 
sort? Your land must be a realm of peace and content, and there must 
gardeners be in high honour.' 

'Not all is well there,' said Frodo, 'but certainly gardeners are 
honoured.' 

'But folk must grow weary there, even in their gardens, as do all 
things under the Sun of this world. And you are far from home and wayworn. 
No more tonight. Sleep, both of you — in peace, if you can. Fear not! I do 
not wish to see it, or touch it, or know more of it than I know (which is 
enough), lest peril perchance waylay me and I fall lower in the test than 
Frodo son of Drogo. Go now to rest — but first tell me only, if you will, 
whither you wish to go, and what to do. For I must watch, and wait, and 
think. Time passes. In the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways 
appointed to us.’ 

Frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed. Now 
a great weariness came down on him like a cloud. He could dissemble and 
resist no longer. 

’I was going to find a way into Mordor,' he said faintly. 'I was going 
to Gorgoroth. I must find the Mountain of Fire and cast the thing into the 




gulf of Doom. Gandalf said so. I do not think I shall ever get there.' 

Faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then suddenly 
he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him to the bed 
and laid him there, and covered him warmly. At once he fell into a deep 
sleep. 

Another bed was set beside him for his servant. Sam hesitated for a 
moment, then bowing very low: 'Good night, Captain, my lord,' he said. 'You 
took the chance, sir.' 

'Did I so?’ said Faramir. 

'Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.' 

Faramir smiled. 'A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the praise of 
the praiseworthy is above all rewards. Yet there was naught in this to 
praise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done.' 

'Ah well, sir,' said Sam, 'you said my master had an elvish air and 
that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that 
reminds me of, of — well, Gandalf, of wizards. 

'Maybe,' said Faramir. 'Maybe you discern from far away the air of 
N®menor. Good night!’ 




Chapter 6 . The Forbidden Pool 



Frodo woke to find Faramir bending over him. For a second old fears 
seized him and he sat up and shrank away. 

'There is nothing to fear,' said Faramir. 

'Is it morning already? ' said Frodo yawning. 

'Not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is setting. 

Will you come and see it? Also there is a matter on which I desire your 
counsel. I am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you come? ’ 

'I will,' said Frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm 
blanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the fireless cave. The noise of the 
water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir. 

Sam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his 
master’s empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark figures, 
Frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with 
pale white light. He hurried after them, past rows of men sleeping on 
mattresses along the wall. As he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the 
Curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread: 
melting icicles of moonlight. But he did not pause to admire it, and turning 
aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in the wall of the 
cave. 

They went first along a black passage, then up many wet steps, and so 
came to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky, 
gleaming high above through a long deep shaft. From here two flights of 
steps led: one going on, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream; 
the other turning away to the left. This they followed. It wound its way up 
like a turret- stair. 

At last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were 
on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet. At their right, eastwards, the 
torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then, pouring down a steep 
race, it filled a smooth-hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked 
with foam, and curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer 
over the edge that yawned upon their left. A man stood there, near the 
brink, silent, gazing down. 

Frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and 




dived. Then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and 
cold, as if dawn were near. Far off in the West the full moon was sinking, 
round and white. Pale mists shimmered in the great vale below: a wide gulf 
of silver fume, beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the Anduin. A 
black darkness loomed beyond, and in it glinted, here and there, cold, 
sharp, remote, white as the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the 
White Mountains of the Realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow. 

For a while Frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran 
through him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night -lands his 
old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. Why was he 
brought here out of forgetful sleep? 

Sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain 
himself from muttering, for his master's ear alone as he thought: ’It's a 
fine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the 
bones ! What's going on? ’ 

Faramir heard and answered. 'Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil as he goes 
from Middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old Mindolluin. It is 
worth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought you to see-though as for 
you, Samwise, you were not brought, and do but pay the penalty of your 
watchfulness. A draught of wine shall amend it. Come, look now! ' 

Fie stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge, and Frodo 
followed. Sam hung back. He already felt insecure enough on this high wet 
platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they saw the white 
waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval 
basin in the rocks, until they found their way out again through a narrow 
gate, and flowed away, fuming and chattering, into calmer and more level 
reaches. The moonlight still slanted down to the fall's foot and gleamed on 
the ripples of the basin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on 
the near bank, but even as he looked at it, it dived and vanished just 
beyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the black water as neatly 
as an arrow or an edgewise stone. 

Faramir turned to the man at his side. 'Now what would you say that it 
is, Anborn? A squirrel, or a kingfisher? Are there black kingfishers in the 
night-pools of Mirkwood? ' 

v 'Tis not a bird, whatever else it be,' answered Anborn. 'It has four 
limbs and dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows, too. What 
is it at? Seeking a way up behind the Curtain to our hidings? It seems we 




are discovered at last. I have my bow here, and I have posted other archers, 
nigh as good marksmen as myself, on either bank. We wait only for your 
command to shoot, Captain.' 

'Shall we shoot? ' said Faramir, turning quickly to Frodo. 

Frodo did not answer for a moment. Then 'No! ’ he said. 'No! I beg you 
not to.’ If Sam had dared, he would have said 'Yes,' quicker and louder. He 
could not see, but he guessed well enough from their words what they were 
looking at. 

'You know, then, what this thing is? ' said Faramir. 'Come, now you 
have seen, tell me why it should be spared. In all our words together you 
have not once spoken of your gangrel companion, and I let him be for the 
time. He could wait till he was caught and brought before me. I sent my 
keenest huntsmen to seek him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of 
him till now, save Anborn here, once at dusk y esterevening. But now he has 
done worse trespass than only to go coney-snaring in the uplands: he has 
dared to come to Henneth Annyn, and his life is forfeit. I marvel at the 
creature: so secret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before 
our very window. Does he think that men sleep without watch all night? Why 
does he so?’ 

'There are two answers, I think,' said Frodo. 'For one thing, he knows 
little of Men, and sly though he is, your refuge is so hidden that perhaps 
he does not know that Men are concealed here. For another, I think he is 
allured here by a mastering desire, stronger than his caution.' 

'He is lured here, you say? ' said Faramir in a low voice. 'Can he, 
does he then know of your burden? ’ 

'Indeed yes. He bore it himself for many years.’ 

'He bore it? ' said Faramir, breathing sharply in his wonder. 'This 
matter winds itself ever in new riddles. Then he is pursuing it? ’ 

'Maybe. It is precious to him. But I did not speak of that.' 

'What then does the creature seek? ' 

'Fish,' said Frodo. 'Look! ’ 

They peered down at the dark pool. A little black head appeared at the 
far end of the basin, just out of the deep shadow of the rocks. There was a 
brief silver glint, and a swirl of tiny ripples. It swam to the side, and 
then with marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and 
up the bank. At once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing 
that glittered as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling 




behind the stony wall at the pool's end. 

Faramir laughed softly. 'Fish! ' he said. 'It is a less perilous 
hunger. Or maybe not: fish from the pool of Henneth Annyn may cost him all 
he has to give.’ 

'Now I have him at the arrow-point,' said Anborn. 'Shall I not shoot, 
Captain? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.' 

'Wait, Anborn,' said Faramir. 'This is a harder matter than it seems. 

What have you to say now, Frodo? Why should we spare? ’ 

'The creature is wretched and hungry,’ said Frodo, 'and unaware of his 
danger. And Gandalf, your Mithrandir, he would have bidden you not to slay 
him for that reason, and for others. He forbade the Elves to do so. I do not 
know clearly why, and of what I guess I cannot speak openly out here. But 
this creature is in some way bound up with my errand. Until you found us and 
took us, he was my guide.' 

'Your guide! ' said Faramir. 'The matter becomes ever stranger. I would 
do much for you, Frodo, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go 
free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be 
caught by Ores and tell all he knows under threat of pain. He must be slain 
or taken. Slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. But how can this slippery 
thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft? ’ 

'Let me go down quietly to him,’ said Frodo. 'You may keep your bows 
bent, and shoot me at least, if I fail. I shall not run away.’ 

'Go then and be swift! ’ said Faramir. 'If he comes off alive, he 
should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days. Lead Frodo 
down to the bank, Anborn, and go softly. The thing has a nose and ears. Give 
me your bow.' 

Anborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing, 
and then up the other stair, until at last they came to a narrow opening 
shrouded with thick bushes. Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on 
the top of the southern bank above the pool. It was now dark and the falls 
were pale and grey, reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western 
sky. He could not see Gollum. He went forward a short way and Anborn 
came 

softly behind him. 

'Goon! ' he breathed in Frodo's ear. 'Have a care to your right. If 
you fall in the pool, then no one but your fishing friend can help you. And 
forget not that there are bowmen near at hand, though you may not see them.’ 




Frodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to 
steady himself. The rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but 
slippery. He halted listening. At first he could hear no sound but the 
unceasing rush of the fall behind him. Then presently he heard, not far 
ahead, a hissing murmur. 

’Fissh, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last, yes. 

Now we can eat fish in peace. No, not in peace, precious. For Precious is 
lost; yes, lost. Dirty hobbits, nasty hobbits. Gone and left us, gollum; and 
Precious is gone. Only poor Smjagol all alone. No Precious. Nasty Men, 
they'll take it, steal my Precious. Thieves. We hates them. Fissh, nice 
fissh: Makes us strong. Makes eyes bright, fingers tight, yes. Throttle 
them, precious. Throttle them all, yes, if we gets chances. Nice fissh. Nice 
fissh! ' 

So it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall, only interrupted 
by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. Frodo shivered, listening with 
pity and disgust. He wished it would stop, and that he never need hear that 
voice again. Anborn was not far behind. He could creep back and ask him to 
get the huntsmen to shoot. They would probably get close enough, while 
Gollum was gorging and off his guard. Only one true shot, and Frodo would be 
rid of the miserable voice for ever. But no, Gollum had a claim on him now. 
The servant has a claim on the master for service, even service in fear. 

They would have foundered in the Dead Marshes but for Gollum. Frodo 
knew, 

too, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it. 

'Smjagol! ' he said softly. 

'Fissh, nice fissh,’ said the voice. 

'Smjagol! ’ he said, a little louder. The voice stopped. 

'Smjagol, Master has come to look for you. Master is here. Come, 
Smjagol! ' There was no answer but a soft hiss, as of intaken breath. 

'Come, Smjagol! ' said Frodo. 'We are in danger. Men will kill you, if 
they find you here. Come quickly, if you wish to escape death. Come to 
Master!' 

'No!' said the voice. 'Not nice Master. Leaves poor Smjagol and goes 
with new friends. Master can wait. Smjagol hasn't finished.' 

'There's no time,' said Frodo. 'Bring fish with you. Come! ’ 

'No! Must finish fish.' 

'Smjagol! ' said Frodo desperately. 'Precious will be angry. I shall 




take Precious, and I shall say: make him swallow the bones and choke. Never 
taste fish again. Come, Precious is waiting! ' 

There was a sharp hiss. Presently out of the darkness Gollum came 
crawling on all fours, like an erring dog called to heel. He had a 
half-eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand. He came close to 
Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him. His pale eyes were shining. 
Then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up. 

'Nice Master! ' he whispered. 'Nice hobbit, come back to poor Smjagol. 
Good Smjagol comes. Now let's go, go quickly, yes. Through the trees, while 
the Faces are dark. Yes, come let's go! ' 

'Yes, we'll go soon,' said Frodo. 'But not at once. I will go with you 
as I promised. I promise again. But not now. You are not safe yet. I will 
save you, but you must trust me.’ 

'We must trust Master? ’ said Gollum doubtfully. 'Why? Why not go at 
once? Where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? Where is he?' 

'Away up there,' said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall. 'I am not going 
without him. We must go back to him.' His heart sank. This was too much like 
trickery. He did not really fear that Faramir would allow Gollum to be 
killed, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly 
what Frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. It 
would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that 
Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do? — 
to keep faith, as near as might be, with both sides. 'Come!' he said. 'Or 
the Precious will be angry. We are going back now, up the stream. Go on, go 
on, you go in front! ’ 

Gollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way, snuffling and 
suspicious. Presently he stopped and raised his head. 'Something's there! ' 
he said. 'Not a hobbit.’ Suddenly he turned back. A green light was 
flickering in his bulging eyes. 'Masster, masster!' he hissed. 'Wicked! 
Tricksy! False!' He spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping 
fingers. 

At that moment the great black shape of Anborn loomed up behind him and 
came down on him. A large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and 
pinned him. He twisted round like lightning, all wet and slimy as he was, 
wriggling like an eel, biting and scratching like a cat. But two more men 
came up out of the shadows. 

'Hold still! ' said one. 'Or we'll stick you as full of pins as a 




hedgehog. Hold still!' 

Gollum went limp, and began to whine and weep. They tied him, none too 
gently. 

'Easy, easy! ' said Frodo. 'He has no strength to match you. Don't hurt 
him, if you can help it. He'll be quieter, if you don't. Smjagol! They won't 
hurt you. I'll go with you, and you shall come to no harm. Not unless they 
kill me too. Trust Master! ' 

Gollum turned and spat at him. The men picked him up, put a hood over 
his eyes, and carried him off. 

Frodo followed them, feeling very wretched. They went through the 
opening behind the bushes, and back, down the stairs and passages, into the 
cave. Two or three torches had been lit. Men were stirring. Sam was there, 
and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried. 'Got him?’ 
he said to Frodo. 

'Yes. Well no, I didn't get him. He came to me, because he trusted me 
at first, I'm afraid. I did not want him tied up like this. I hope it will 
be all right; but I hate the whole business.' 

'So do I,’ said Sam. 'And nothing will ever be all right where that 
piece of misery is.’ 

A man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at 
the back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in his chair, and the lamp 
had been rekindled in its niche above his head. He signed to them to sit 
down on the stools beside him. 'Bring wine for the guests,' he said. 'And 
bring the prisoner to me.' 

The wine was brought, and then Anborn came carrying Gollum. He 
removed 

the cover from Gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to 
support him. Gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy 
pale lids. A very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling 
of fish (he still clutched one in his hand); his sparse locks were hanging 
like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling. 

'Foose us! Foose us! ’ he said. 'The cord hurts us, yes it does, it 
hurts us, and we've done nothing.' 

'Nothing? ' said Faramir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen 
glance, but without any expression in his face either of anger, or pity, or 
wonder. 'Nothing? Have you never done anything worthy of binding or of 



worse 




punishment? However, that is not for me to judge, happily. But tonight you 
have come where it is death to come. The fish of this pool are dearly 
bought.' 

Gollum dropped the fish from his hand. 'Don't want fish,' he said. 

'The price is not set on the fish,' said Faramir. 'Only to come here 
and look on the pool bears the penalty of death. I have spared you so far at 
the prayer of Frodo here, who says that of him at least you have deserved 
some thanks. But you must also satisfy me. What is your name? Whence do 
you 

come? And whither do you go? What is your business? ’ 

'We are lost, lost,' said Gollum. 'No name, no business, no Precious, 
nothing. Only empty. Only hungry; yes, we are hungry. A few little fishes, 
nasty bony little fishes, for a poor creature, and they say death. So wise 
they are; so just, so very just.' 

'Not very wise,' said Faramir. 'But just: yes perhaps, as just as our 
little wisdom allows. Unloose him Frodo! ' Faramir took a small nail -knife 
from his belt and handed it to Frodo. Gollum misunderstanding the gesture, 
squealed and fell down. 

'Now, Smjagol! ' said Frodo. 'You must trust me. I will not desert you. 
Answer truthfully, if you can. It will do you good not harm.' He cut the 
cords on Gollum's wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet. 

'Come hither! ' said Faramir. 'Look at me! Do you know the name of this 
place? Have you been here before? ’ 

Slowly Gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into Faramir's. 

All light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into 
the clear unwavering eyes of the man of Gondor. There was a still silence. 
Then Gollum dropped his head and shrank down, until he was squatting on the 
floor, shivering. 'We doesn't know and we doesn't want to know,' he 
whimpered. 'Never came here; never come again.' 

'There are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms 
behind them,' said Faramir. 'But in this I judge that you speak the truth. 

It is well for you. What oath will you swear never to return; and never to 
lead any living creature hither by word or sign?’ 

'Master knows,' said Gollum with a sidelong glance at Frodo. 'Yes, he 
knows. We will promise Master, if he saves us. We'll promise to It, yes.' He 
crawled to Frodo's feet. 'Save us, nice Master! ' he whined. 'Smjagol 
promises to Precious, promises faithfully. Never come again, never speak, no 




never! No, precious, no!' 

'Are you satisfied? ' said Faramir. 

'Yes,' said Frodo. 'At least, you must either accept this promise or 
carry out your law. You will get no more. But I promised that if he came to 
me, he should not be harmed. And I would not be proved faithless.' 

Faramir sat for a moment in thought. 'Very good,' he said at last. 'I 
surrender you to your master, to Frodo son of Drogo. Let him declare what he 
will do with you ! ’ 

'But, Lord Faramir,' said Frodo bowing, 'you have not yet declared your 
will concerning the said Frodo, and until that is made known, he cannot 
shape his plans for himself or his companions. Your judgement was postponed 
until the morning; but that is now at hand.’ 

'Then I will declare my doom,' said Faramir. 'As for you, Frodo, in so 
far as lies in me under higher authority, I declare you free in the realm 
of, Gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds; save only that neither you 
nor any that go with you have leave to come to this place unbidden. This 
doom shall stand for a year and a day, and then cease, unless you shall 
before that term come to Minas Tirith and present yourself to the Lord and 
Steward of the City. Then I will entreat him to confirm what I have done and 
to make it lifelong. In the meantime, whomsoever you take under your 
protection shall be under my protection and under the shield of Gondor. Are 
you answered? ’ 

Frodo bowed low. ’I am answered,' he said, 'and I place myself at your 
service, if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable.’ 

'It is of great worth,' said Faramir. 'And now, do you take this 
creature, this Smjagol, under your protection? ' 

'I do take Smjagol under my protection,' said Frodo. Sam sighed 
audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he 
thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a 
great many more words and bows. 

'Then I say to you,' said Faramir, turning to Gollum, 'you are under 
doom of death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part. Yet 
if ever you be found by any man of Gondor astray without him, the doom shall 
fall. And may death find you swiftly, within Gondor or without, if you do 
not well serve him. Now answer me: whither would you go? You were his 
guide, 

he says. Whither were you leading him? ' Gollum made no reply. 




'This I will not have secret,' said Faramir. 'Answer me, or I will 
reverse my judgement! ’ Still Gollum did not answer. 

'I will answer for him,' said Frodo. 'He brought me to the Black Gate, 
as I asked; but it was impassable.' 

'There is no open gate into the Nameless Land,’ said Faramir. 

'Seeing this, we turned aside and came by the Southward road ’ Frodo 
continued; 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to Minas 
Ithil . ' 

'Minas Morgul,' said Faramir. 

'I do not know clearly,' said Frodo; 'but the path climbs, I think, up 
into the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city 
stands. It goes up to a high cleft and so down to — that which is beyond.’ 

'Do you know the name of that high pass? ’ said Faramir. 

'No,' said Frodo. 

'It is called Cirith Ungol.' Gollum hissed sharply and began muttering 
to himself. 'Is not that its name? ’ said Faramir turning to him. 

'No! ' said Gollum, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed 
him. 'Yes, yes, we heard the name once. But what does the name matter to us? 
Master says he must get in. So we must try some way. There is no other way 
to try, no.' 

'No other way? 'said Faramir. 'How do you know that? And who has 
explored all the confines of that dark realm? ' He looked long and 
thoughtfully at Gollum. Presently he spoke again. 'Take this creature away, 
Anborn. Treat him gently, but watch him. And do not you, Smjagol, try to 
dive into the falls. The rocks have such teeth there as would slay you 
before your time. Leave us now and take your fish! ' 

Anborn went out and Gollum went cringing before him. The curtain was 
drawn across the recess. 

'Frodo, I think you do very unwisely in this,' said Faramir. 'I do not 
think you should go with this creature. It is wicked.' 

'No, not altogether wicked,' said Frodo. 

'Not wholly, perhaps,' said Faramir; 'but malice eats it like a canker, 
and the evil is growing. He will lead you to no good. If you will part with 
him, I will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders 
of Gondor that he may name.' 

'He would not take it,' said Frodo. 'He would follow after me as he 
long has done. And I have promised many times to take him under my 




protection and to go where he led. You would not ask me to break faith with 
him?' 

'No,' said Faramir. 'But my heart would. For it seems less evil to 
counsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself, especially if one 
sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm. But no — if he will go with 
you, you must now endure him. But I do not think you are holden to go to 
Cirith Ungol, of which he has told you less than he knows. That much I 
perceived clearly in his mind. Do not go to Cirith Ungol!' 

'Where then shall I go? ' said Frodo. 'Back to the Black Gate and 
deliver myself up to the guard? What do you know against this place that 
makes its name so dreadful? ’ 

'Nothing certain,' said Faramir. 'We of Gondor do not ever pass east of 
the Road in these days, and none of us younger men has ever done so, nor has 
any of us set foot upon the Mountains of Shadow. Of them we know only old 
report and the rumour of bygone days. But there is some dark terror that 
dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. If Cirith Ungol is named, old men 
and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent. 

,The valley of Minas Morgul passed into evil very long ago, and it was 
a menace and a dread while the banished Enemy dwelt yet far away, and 
Ithilien was still for the most part in our keeping. As you know, that city 
was once a strong place, proud and fair, Minas Ithil, the twin sister of our 
own city. But it was taken by fell men whom the Enemy in his first strength 
had dominated, and who wandered homeless and masterless after his fall. It 
is said that their lords were men of N®menor who had fallen into dark 
wickedness; to them the Enemy had given rings of power, and he had 
devoured 

them: living ghosts they were become, terrible and evil. After his going 
they took Minas Ithil and dwelt there, and they filled it, and all the 
valley about, with decay: it seemed empty and was not so, for a shapeless 
fear lived within the ruined walls. Nine Lords there were, and after the 
return of their Master, which they aided and prepared in secret, they grew 
strong again. Then the Nine Riders issued forth from the gates of horror, 
and we could not withstand them. Do not approach their citadel. You will be 
espied. It is a place of sleepless malice, full of lidless eyes. Do not go 
that way! ' 

'But where else will you direct me? ' said Frodo. 'You cannot yourself, 
you say, guide me to the mountains, nor over them. But over the mountains I 




am bound, by solemn undertaking to the Council, to find a way or perish in 
the seeking. And if I turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where 
then shall I go among Elves or Men? Would you have me come to Gondor 
with 

this Thing, the Thing that drove your brother mad with desire? What spell 
would it work in Minas Tirith? Shall there be two cities of Minas Morgul, 
grinning at each other across a dead land filled with rottenness? ' 

'I would not have it so,' said Faramir. 

'Then what would you have me do? ' 

'I know not. Only I would not have you go to death or to torment. And I 
do not think that Mithrandir would have chosen this way.' 

'Yet since he is gone, I must take such paths as I can find. And there 
is no time for long searching,' said Frodo. 

'It is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,' said Faramir. 'But at the 
least, remember my warning: beware of this guide, Smjagol. He has done 
murder before now. I read it in him.' He sighed. 

'Well, so we meet and part, Frodo son of Drogo. You have no need of 
soft words: I do not hope to see you again on any other day under this Sun. 
But you shall go now with my blessing upon you, and upon all your people. 
Rest a little while food is prepared for you. 

’I would gladly learn how this creeping Smjagol became possessed of the 
Thing of which we speak, and how he lost it, but I will not trouble you now. 
If ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our 
tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old grief, you shall tell 
me then. Until that time, or some other time beyond the vision of the 
Seeing-stones of N®menor, farewell! ’ 

He rose and bowed low to Frodo, and drawing the curtain passed out into 
the cave. 




Chapter 7. Journey to the Cross-roads 



Frodo and Sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting 
for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day 
began. After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a 
table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had 
not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary. 

When they had finished they stood up. 'May no hunger trouble you on the 
road,' said Faramir. 'You have little provision, but some small store of 
food fit for travellers I have ordered to be stowed in your packs. You will 
have no lack of water as you walk in Ithilien, but do not drink of any 
stream that flows from Imlad Morgul, the Valley of Living Death. This also I 
must tell you. My scouts and watchers have all returned, even some that have 
crept within sight of the Morannon. They all find a strange thing. The land 
is empty. Nothing is on the road, and no sound of foot, or horn, or 
bowstring is anywhere to be heard. A waiting silence broods above the 
Nameless Land. I do not know what this portends. But the time draws swiftly 
to some great conclusion. Storm is coming. Hasten while you may! If you are 
ready, let us go. The Sun will soon rise above the shadow.’ 

The hobbits' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had 
been), and also two stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with 
carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs. 

'I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,' said Faramir; 

'but take these staves. They may be of service to those who walk or climb in 
the wild. The men of the White Mountains use them; though these have been 
cut down to your height and newly shod. They are made of the fair tree 
lebethron, beloved of the woodwrights of Gondor, and a virtue has been set 
upon them of finding and returning. May that virtue not wholly fail under 
the Shadow into which you go!’ 

The hobbits bowed low. 'Most gracious host,' said Frodo, 'it was said 
to me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret 
and unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have 
shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.' 

Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or 
hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, 




though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir. 

'Your guide must be blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but you and your 
servant Samwise I release from this, if you wish.' 

Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to 
bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes 
first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' This was done, 
and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annyn. After they had passed the 
passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about 
them. Still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently 
down. At last the voice of Faramir ordered them to be uncovered. 

They stood under the boughs of the woods again. No noise of the falls 
could be heard, for a long southward slope lay now between them and the 
ravine in which the stream flowed. To the west they could see light through 
the trees, as if the world came there to a sudden end, at a brink looking 
out only on to sky. 

'Here is the last parting of our ways,' said Faramir. 'If you take my 
counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. Go straight on, for thus you will 
have the cover of the woodland for many miles. On your west is an edge where 
the land falls into the great vales, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes 
in long hillsides. Keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. In 
the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight, I think. The land 
dreams in a false peace, and for a while all evil is withdrawn. Fare you 
well, while you may!' 

He embraced the hobbits then, after the manner of his people, stooping, 
and placing his hands upon their shoulders, and kissing their foreheads. 'Go 
with the good will of all good men!' he said. 

They bowed to the ground. Then he turned and without looking back he 
left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away. 

They marvelled to see with what speed these green -clad men now moved, 
vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. The forest where Faramir had 
stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed. 

Frodo sighed and turned back southward. As if to mark his disregard of 
all such courtesy, Gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. 
'Hungry again already?' thought Sam. 'Well, now for it again!’ 

'Have they gone at last? ' said Gollum. 'Nassty wicked Men! Smjagol's 
neck still hurts him, yes it does. Let's go! ' 

'Yes, let us go,' said Frodo. 'But if you can only speak ill of those 




who showed you mercy, keep silent! ' 

'Nice Master! ' said Gollum. 'Smjagol was only joking. Always forgives, 
he does, yes, yes, even nice Master's little trickses. Oh yes, nice Master, 
nice Smjagol! ' 

Frodo and Sam did not answer. Hoisting their packs and taking their 
staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of Ithilien. 

Twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by 
Faramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread 
enough to last while it was still fresh. Gollum ate nothing. 

The sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the 
light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in 
cool green shadow, and all about them was silence. The birds seemed all to 
have flown away or to have fallen dumb. 

Darkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night 
they halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more from Henneth 
Annyn. Frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an 
ancient tree. Sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there 
was never a sign of Gollum, who had slipped off as soon as the others had 
settled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had 
wandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he 
returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions. 

'Must get up, yes they must!’ he said. 'Long ways to go still, south 
and east. Hobbits must make haste!' 

That day passed much as the day before had gone, except that the 
silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under 
the trees. It felt as if thunder was brewing. Gollum often paused, sniffing 
the air, and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed. 

As the third stage of their day's march drew on and afternoon waned, 
the forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more scattered. Great 
ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and 
there among them hoary ash-trees, and giant oaks just putting out their 
brown-green buds. About them lay long launds of green grass dappled with 
celandine and anemones, white and blue, now folded for sleep; and there were 
acres populous with the leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek 
bell-stems were thrusting through the mould. No living creature, beast or 
bird, was to be seen, but in these open places Gollum grew afraid, and they 
walked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another. 




Light was fading fast when they came to the forest-end. There they sat 
under an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a 
steep crumbling bank. A deep dim valley lay before them. On its further side 
the woods gathered again, blue and grey under the sullen evening, and 
marched on southwards. To the right the Mountains of Gondor glowed, 
remote 

in the West, under a fire-flecked sky. To the left lay darkness: the 
towering walls of Mordor; and out of that darkness the long valley came, 
falling steeply in an ever-widening trough towards the Anduin. At its bottom 
ran a hurrying stream: Frodo could hear its stony voice coming up through 
the silence; and beside it on the hither side a road went winding down like 
a pale ribbon, down into chill grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched. 
There it seemed to Frodo that he descried far off, floating as it were on a 
shadowy sea, the high dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn 
and dark. 

Fie turned to Gollum. 'Do you know where we are? ' he said. 

'Yes, Master. Dangerous places. This is the road from the Tower of the 
Moon, Master, down to the ruined city by the shores of the River. The ruined 
city, yes, very nasty place, full of enemies. We shouldn't have taken Men's 
advice. Hobbits have come a long way out of the path. Must go east now, away 
up there.' He waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains. 'And we 
can't use this road. Oh no! Cruel peoples come this way, down from the 
Tower.' 

Frodo looked down on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving on it 
now. It appeared lonely and forsaken, running down to empty ruins in the 
mist. But there was an evil feeling in the air, as if things might indeed be 
passing up and down that eyes could not see. Frodo shuddered as he looked 
again at the distant pinnacles now dwindling into night, and the sound of 
the water seemed cold and cruel: the voice of Morgulduin, the polluted 
stream that flowed from the Valley of the Wraiths. 

'What shall we do? ' he said. 'We have walked long and far. Shall we 
look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden? ' 

'No good hiding in the dark,' said Gollum. 'It's in day that hobbits 
must hide now, yes in day.' 

'Oh come! ' said Sam. 'We must rest for a bit, even if we get up again 
in the middle of the night. There'll still be hours of dark then time enough 
for you to take us a long march, if you know the way.' 




Gollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the 
trees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. 

He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate 
they all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick 
branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a 
fairly comfortable refuge. Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the 
canopy of the tree. Frodo and Sam drank a little water and ate some bread 
and dried fruit, but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits 
did not shut their eyes. 

It must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up: suddenly 
they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. He listened and 
sniffed, which seemed, as they had noticed before, his usual method of 
discovering the time of night. 

'Are we rested? Have we had beautiful sleep?' he said. 'Let's go!' 

'We aren't, and we haven't,' growled Sam. 'But we'll go if we must.' 

Gollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours, 
and the hobbits followed more slowly. 

As soon as they were down they went on again with Gollum leading, 
eastwards, up the dark sloping land. They could see little, for the night 
was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before 
they stumbled against them. The ground became more broken and walking 
was 

more difficult, but Gollum seemed in no way troubled. He led them through 
thickets and wastes of brambles; sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or 
dark pit, sometimes down into black bush-shrouded hollows and out again; but 
if ever they went a little downward, always the further slope was longer and 
steeper. They were climbing steadily. At their first halt they looked back, 
and they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left behind 
lying like a vast dense shadow, a darker night under the dark blank sky. 
There seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out of the East, eating 
up the faint blurred stars. Later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing 
cloud, but it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare. 

At last Gollum turned to the hobbits. 'Day soon,' he said. 'Hobbits 
must hurry. Not safe to stay in the open in these places. Make haste! ' 

He quickened his pace, and they followed him wearily. Soon they began 
to climb up on to a great hog-back of land. For the most part it was covered 
with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and low tough thorns, though 




here and there clearings opened, the scars of recent fires. The gorse-bushes 
became more frequent as they got nearer the top; very old and tall they 
were, gaunt and leggy below but thick above, and already putting out yellow 
flowers that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent. So tall 
were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them, 
passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould. 

On the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march and 
crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns. Their twisted 
boughs, stooping to the ground, were overridden by a clambering maze of old 
briars. Deep inside there was a hollow hall, raftered with dead branch and 
bramble, and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring. There they 
lay for a while, too tired yet to eat; and peering out through the holes in 
the covert they watched for the slow growth of day. 

But no day came, only a dead brown twilight. In the East there was a 
dull red glare under the lowering cloud: it was not the red of dawn. Across 
the tumbled lands between, the mountains of the Ephel D®ath frowned at 
them, 

black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away, above 
with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiery 
glow. Away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark 
and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward. 

'Which way do we go from here?' asked Frodo. 'Is that the opening of-of 
the Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass?’ 

'Need we think about it yet?’ said Sam, 'Surely we're not going to move 
any more today, if day it is?' 

'Perhaps not, perhaps not,’ said Gollum. 'But we must go soon, to the 
Cross-roads. Yes, to the Cross-roads. That's the way over there yes, 
Master.' 

The red glare over Mordor died away. The twilight deepened as great 
vapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and Sam took a little 
food and then lay down, but Gollum was restless. He would not eat any of 
their food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the 
bushes, sniffing and muttering. Then, suddenly he disappeared. 

'Off hunting, I suppose,' said Sam and yawned. It was his turn to sleep 
first, and he was soon deep in a dream. He thought he was back in the Bag 
End garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which 
made him stoop. It all seemed very weedy and rank somehow, and thorns and 




bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge. 

'A job of work for me, I can see; but I'm so tired,' he kept on saying. 
Presently he remembered what he was looking for. 'My pipe!' he said, and 
with that he woke up. 

'Silly!' he said to himself, as he opened his eyes and wondered why he 
was lying down under the hedge. 'It's in your pack all the time!' Then he 
realized, first that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf, and 
next that he was hundreds of miles from Bag End. He sat up. It seemed to be 
almost dark. Why had his master let him sleep on out of turn, right on till 
evening? 

'Haven't you had no sleep, Mr. Frodo?' he said. 'What's the time? Seems 
to be getting late!' 

'No it isn't,' said Frodo. 'But the day is getting darker instead of 
lighter: darker and darker. As far as I can tell, it isn't midday yet, and 
you've only slept for about three hours.' 

'I wonder what's up,' said Sam. 'Is there a storm coming? If so it's 
going to be the worst there ever was. We shall wish we were down a deep 
hole, not just stuck under a hedge.' He listened. 'What's that? Thunder, or 
drums, or what is it? ' 

'I don't know,' said Frodo. 'It's been going on for a good while now. 
Sometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems to be the heavy 
air throbbing in your ears.' 

Sam looked round. 'Where's Gollum? ' he said. 'Hasn't he come back 
yet?' 

'No,' said Frodo. 'There's not been a sign or sound of him.' 

'Well, I can't abide him,' said Sam. 'In fact, I've never taken 
anything on a journey that I'd have been less sorry to lose on the way. But 
it would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to go and get lost 
now, just when we shall need him most — that is, if he's ever going to be 
any use, which I doubt.' 

'You forget the Marshes,' said Frodo. I hope nothing has happened to 
him.' 

'And I hope he's up to no tricks. And anyway I hope he doesn't fall 
into other hands, as you might say. Because if he does, we shall soon be in 
for trouble.' 

At that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again, louder now 
and deeper. The ground seemed to quiver under their feet. 'I think we are in 




for trouble anyhow,’ said Frodo. 'I'm afraid our journey is drawing to an 
end.’ 

’Maybe,’ said Sam; 'but where there's life there's hope , as my Gaffer 
used to say; and need of vittles, as he mostway s used to add. You have a 
bite, Mr. Frodo, and then a bit of sleep.’ 

The afternoon, as Sam supposed it must be called, wore on. Looking out 
from the covert he could see only a dun, shadowless world, fading slowly 
into a featureless, colourless gloom. It felt stifling but not warm. Frodo 
slept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes murmuring. Twice Sam 
thought he heard him speaking Gandalf s name. The time seemed to drag 
interminably. Suddenly Sam heard a hiss behind him, and there was Gollum 
on 

all fours, peering at them with gleaming eyes. 

'Wake up, wake up! Wake up, sleepies!’ he whispered. 'Wake up! No time 
to lose. We must go, yes, we must go at once. No time to lose!’ 

Sam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited. 'Go 
now? What’s your little game? It isn’t time yet. It can’t be tea-time even, 
leastways not in decent places where there is tea-time.’ 

'Silly! ’ hissed Gollum. 'We’re not in decent places. Time's running 
short, yes, running fast. No time to lose. We must go. Wake up. Master, wake 
u He clawed at Frodo; and Frodo, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and 
seized him by the arm. Gollum tore himself loose and backed away. 

'They mustn't be silly,' he hissed. 'We must go. No time to lose!’ And 
nothing more could they get out of him. Where he had been, and what he 
thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry, he would not say. Sam was 
filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but Frodo gave no sign of what 
was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out 
into the ever -gathering darkness. 

Very stealthily Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover 
wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any 
open space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the 
wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor 
heard them, walking as warily as the little people can. Without the crack of 
a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished. 

For about an hour they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed by 
the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only now and 
again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some 




hollow of the hills. Down from their hiding-place they went, and then 
turning south they steered as straight a course as Gollum could find across 
a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains. Presently, not far 
ahead, looming up like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. As they drew 
nearer they became aware that these were of vast size, very ancient it 
seemed, and still towering high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as 
if tempest and lightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill 
them or to shake their fathomless roots. 

The Cross-roads, yes,' whispered Gollum, the first words that had been 
spoken since they left their hiding-place. 'We must go that way.' Turning 
eastward now, he led them up the slope; and then suddenly there it was 
before them: the Southward Road, winding its way about the outer feet of the 
mountains, until presently it plunged into the great ring of trees. 

This is the only way,' whispered Gollum. 'No paths beyond the road. No 
paths. We must go to the Cross-roads. But make haste! Be silent! ' 

As furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they crept 
down on to the road, and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank, 
grey as the stones themselves, and soft-footed as hunting cats. At length 
they reached the trees, and found that they stood in a great roofless ring, 
open in the middle to the sombre sky; and the spaces between their immense 
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall. In the very 
centre four ways met. Behind them lay the road to the Morannon; before them 
it ran out again upon its long journey south; to their right the road from 
old Osgiliath came climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into 
darkness: the fourth way, the road they were to take. 

Standing there for a moment filled with dread Frodo became aware that a 
light was shining; he saw it glowing on Sam's face beside him. Turning 
towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to Osgiliath running 
almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down, down, into the West. There, 
far away, beyond sad Gondor now overwhelmed in shade, the Sun was 
sinking, 

finding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling 
in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied Sea. The brief glow fell upon a 
huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. 

The years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, 
and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted 
by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in 




the midst of its forehead. Upon its knees and mighty chair, and all about 
the pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the 
maggot-folk of Mordor used. 

Suddenly, caught by the level beams, Frodo saw the old king's head: it 
was lying rolled away by the roadside. 'Look, Sam!’ he cried, startled into 
speech. 'Look! The king has got a crown again!' 

The eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the 
high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant 
with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if 
in reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair 
yellow stonecrop gleamed. 

'They cannot conquer for ever!' said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief 
glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering 
of a lamp, black night fell. 




Chapter 8 . The Stairs of Cirith Ungol 



Gollum was tugging at Frodo's cloak and hissing with fear and 
impatience. 'We must go,' he said. 'We mustn’t stand here. Make haste!’ 

Reluctantly Frodo turned his back on the West and followed as his guide 
led him, out into the darkness of the East. They left the ring of trees and 
crept along the road towards the mountains. This road, too, ran straight for 
a while, but soon it began to bend away southwards, until it came right 
under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. Black 
and forbidding it loomed above them, darker than the dark sky behind. 
Crawling under its shadow the road went on, and rounding it sprang east 
again and began to climb steeply. 

Frodo and Sam were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to 
care greatly about their peril. Frodo’s head was bowed; his burden was 
dragging him down again. As soon as the great Cross-roads had been passed, 
the weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien, had begun to grow once more. 
Now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and 
then he saw it, even as Gollum had said that he would: the city of the 
Ringwraiths. He cowered against the stony bank. 

A long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the 
mountains. Upon the further side, some way within the valley's arms high on 
a rocky seat upon the black knees of the Ephel D®ath, stood the walls and 
tower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit 
with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of 
Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of 
the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the 
light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a 
corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing. In the walls and tower 
windows showed, like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness; 
but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then 
another, a huge ghostly head leering into the night. For a moment the three 
companions stood there, shrinking, staring up with unwilling eyes. Gollum 
was the first to recover. Again he pulled at their cloaks urgently, but he 
spoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and 
time seemed to slow its pace, so that between the raising of a foot and the 




setting of it down minutes of loathing passed. 

So they came slowly to the white bridge. Here the road, gleaming 
faintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went on, 
winding deviously up towards the city’s gate: a black mouth opening in the 
outer circle of the northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy 
meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and 
yet horrible of shape, like the demented forms in an uneasy dream; and they 
gave forth a faint sickening charnel-smell; an odour of rottenness filled 
the air. From mead to mead the bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its 
head, carven with cunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and 
loathsome. The water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the 
vapour that rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly 
cold. Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then suddenly, 
as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, 
tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to 
side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his master in his arms, 
as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge. 

'Not that way! No, not that way! ' whispered Gollum, but the breath 
between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he 
cowered to the ground in terror. 

'Hold up, Mr. Frodo! ’ muttered Sam in Frodo’s ear. ’Come back! Not 
that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.’ 

Frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the 
city on the hill. The luminous tower fascinated him, and he fought the 
desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last 
with an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the Ring resisting 
him, dragging at the chain about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked 
away, seemed for the moment to have been blinded. The darkness before him 
was impenetrable. 

Gollum, crawling on the ground like a frightened animal, was already 
vanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his stumbling master, 
followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the 
stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this they 
passed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at 
first, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly 
flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern 
sides of the valley. 




Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum 
in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. Then his 
eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome Morgul-sheen 
perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam and 
of the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious, ever glancing 
fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find 
the darkening path. Slowly they laboured on. As they rose above the stench 
and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their 
heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked 
all night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of 
water. At last they could go no further without a halt. 

Frodo stopped and sat down on a stone. They had now climbed up to the 
top of a great hump of bare rock. Ahead of them there was a bay in the 
valley -side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a 
wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the 
mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above. 

'I must rest a while, Sam,' whispered Frodo. 'It's heavy on me, Sam 
lad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry it? Anyway I must rest before 
we venture on to that.' He pointed to the narrow way ahead. 

'Sssh! ssh! ' hissed Gollum hurrying back to them. 'Sssh! ' His fingers 
were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging at Frodo's sleeve, 
he pointed towards the path; but Frodo would not move. 

'Not yet,' he said, 'not yet.' Weariness and more than weariness 
oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body. 

'I must rest,’ he muttered. 

At this Gollum's fear and agitation became so great that he spoke 
again, hissing behind his hand, as if to keep the sound from unseen 
listeners in the air. 'Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! Eyes can see us. 

When they come to the bridge they will see us. Come away! Climb, climb! 
Come! ' 

'Come, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'He's right, again. We can't stay here.' 

'All right,' said Frodo in a remote voice, as of one speaking half 
asleep. 'I will try.' Wearily he got to his feet. 

But it was too late. At that moment the rock quivered and trembled 
beneath them. The great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled in 
the ground and echoed in the mountains. Then with searing suddenness there 
came a great red flash. Far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the 




sky and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson. In that valley of shadow 
and cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce. Peaks of 
stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the 
uprushing flame in Gorgoroth. Then came a great crack of thunder. 

And Minas Morgul answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks 
of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into 
the sullen clouds. The earth groaned; and out of the city there came a cry. 
Mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the shrill neighing 
of horses wild with rage and fear, there came a rending screech, shivering, 
rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The hobbits 
wheeled round towards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon 
their ears. 

As the terrible cry ended, falling back through a long sickening wail 
to silence, Frodo slowly raised his head. Across the narrow valley, now 
almost on a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood, and its 
cavernous gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth, was gaping 
wide. And out of the gate an army came. 

All that host was clad in sable, dark as the night. Against the wan 
walls and the luminous pavement of the road Frodo could see them, small 
black figures in rank upon rank, marching swiftly and silently, passing 
outwards in an endless stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen 
moving like ordered shadows, and at their head was one greater than all the 
rest: a Rider, all black, save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a 
crown that flickered with a perilous light. Now he was drawing near the 
bridge below, and Frodo's staring eyes followed him, unable to wink or to 
withdraw. Surely there was the Lord of the Nine Riders returned to earth to 
lead his ghastly host to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king 
whose cold hand had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife. The 
old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo's heart. 

Even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as 
with a spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right before the entrance of the 
bridge, and behind him all the host stood still. There was a pause, a dead 
silence. Maybe it was the Ring that called to the Wraith-lord, and for a 
moment he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley. This way 
and that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear, sweeping the 
shadows with its unseen eyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a 
snake, unable to move. And as he waited, he felt, more urgent than ever 




before, the command that he should put on the Ring. But great as the 
pressure was, he felt no inclination now to yield to it. He knew that the 
Ring would only betray him, and that he had not, even if he put it on, the 
power to face the Morgul-king-not yet. There was no longer any answer to 
that command in his own will, dismayed by terror though it was, and he felt 
only the beating upon him of a great power from outside. It took his hand, 
and as Frodo watched with his mind, not willing it but in suspense (as if he 
looked on some old story far away), it moved the hand inch by inch towards 
the chain upon his neck. Then his own will stirred; slowly it forced the 
hand back, and set it to find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his 
breast. Cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on it: the phial of 
Galadriel, so long treasured, and almost forgotten till that hour. As he 
touched it, for a while all thought of the Ring was banished from his mind. 

He sighed and bent his head. 

At that moment the Wraith-king turned and spurred his horse and rode 
across the bridge, and all his dark host followed him. Maybe the elven-hoods 
defied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small enemy; being strengthened, 
had turned aside his thought. But he was in haste. Already the hour had 
struck, and at his great Master's bidding he must march with war into the 
West. 

Soon he had passed, like a shadow into shadow, down the winding road, 
and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So great an army 
had never issued from that vale since the days of Isildur's might; no host 
so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet it 
was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth. 

Frodo stirred. And suddenly his heart went out to Faramir. 'The storm 
has burst at last,' he thought. 'This great array of spears and swords is 
going to Osgiliath. Will Faramir get across in time? He guessed it, but did 
he know the hour? And who can now hold the fords when the King of the 
Nine 

Riders comes? And other armies will come. I am too late. All is lost. I 
tarried on the way. All is lost. Even if my errand is performed, no one will 
ever know. There will be no one I can tell. It will be in vain.' Overcome 
with weakness he wept. And still the host of Morgul crossed the bridge. 

Then at a great distance, as if it came out of memories of the Shire, 
some sunlit early morning, when the day called and doors were opening, he 
heard Sam's voice speaking. 'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! ’ Had the voice 




added: 'Your breakfast is ready,' he would hardly have been surprised. 
Certainly Sam was urgent. 'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone,' he said. 

There was a dull clang. The gates of Minas Morgul had closed. The last 
rank of spears had vanished down the road. The tower still grinned across 
the valley, but the light was fading in it. The whole city was falling back 
into a dark brooding shade, and silence. Yet still it was filled with 
watchfulness. 

'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone, and we'd better go too. There's 
something still alive in that place, something with eyes, or a seeing mind, 
if you take me; and the longer we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get 
on to us. Come on, Mr. Frodo! ' 

Frodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but 
the weakness had passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a 
moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to 
do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel 
or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took 
his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear 
light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom 
and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul, now no 
more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward 
road. 

Gollum, it seemed, had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness 
beyond, when the gates of Minas Morgul opened, leaving the hobbits where 
they lay. He now came creeping back, his teeth chattering and his fingers 
snapping. 'Foolish! Silly! ’ he hissed. 'Make haste! They mustn't think 
danger has passed. It hasn't. Make haste! ' 

They did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It 
was little to the liking of either of them, not even after facing so many 
other perils; but it did not last long. Soon the path reached a rounded 
angle where the mountain-side swelled out again, and there it suddenly 
entered a narrow opening in the rock. They had come to the first stair that 
Gollum had spoken of. The darkness was almost complete, and they could see 
nothing much beyond their hands' stretch; but Gollum's eyes shone pale, 
several feet above, as he turned back towards them. 

'Careful! ' he whispered. 'Steps. Lots of steps. Must be careful! ' 

Care was certainly needed. Frodo and Sam at first felt easier, having 
now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, 




and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long 
black fall behind them. And the steps were narrow, spaced unevenly, and 
often treacherous: they were worn and smooth at the edges, and some were 
broken, and some cracked as foot was set upon them. The hobbits struggled 
on, until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps 
ahead, and forcing their aching knees to bend and straighten; and ever as 
the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose 
higher and higher above their heads. 

At length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they saw 
Gollum's eyes peering down at them again. 'We're up,’ he whispered. ’First 
stair's past. Clever hobbits to climb so high, very clever hobbits. Just a 
few more little steps and that's all, yes.' 

Dizzy and very tired Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last 
step, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. They were in a deep dark 
passage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope 
and without steps. Gollum did not let them rest long. 

'There's another stair still,' he said. 'Much longer stair. Rest when 
we get to the top of next stair. Not yet.’ 

Sam groaned. ’Longer, did you say? ’ he asked. 

'Yes, yess, longer,' said Gollum. 'But not so difficult. Hobbits have 
climbed the Straight Stair. Next comes the Winding Stair.’ 

'And what after that? ' said Sam. 

'We shall see,' said Gollum softly. 'O yes, we shall see! ’ 

’I thought you said there was a tunnel,' said Sam. 'Isn't there a 
tunnel or something to go through? ' 

'O yes, there's a tunnel,' said Gollum. 'But hobbits can rest before 
they try that. If they get through that, they'll be nearly at the top. Very 
nearly, if they get through. O yes ! ' 

Frodo shivered. The climb had made him sweat, but now he felt cold and 
clammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from 
the invisible heights above. He got up and shook himself. 'Well, let's go 
on! 'he said. 'This is no place to sit in.’ 

The passage seemed to go on for miles, and always the chill air flowed 
over them, rising as they went on to a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to 
be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the 
secrets of the high places, or to blow them away into the darkness behind. 
They only knew that they had come to the end, when suddenly they felt no 




wall at their right hand. They could see very little. Great black shapeless 
masses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and about them, but now 
and 

again a dull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds, and for a 
moment they were aware of tall peaks, in front and on either side, like 
pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They seemed to have climbed up many 
hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their left and a chasm 
on their right. 

Gollum led the way close under the cliff. For the present they were no 
longer climbing, but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the 
dark, and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way. Their 
going was slow and cautious. How many hours had passed since they had 
entered the Morgul Vale neither Sam nor Frodo could any longer guess. The 
night seemed endless. 

At length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more 
a stairway opened before them. Again they halted, and again they began to 
climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this stairway did not delve into 
the mountain -side. Here the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path 
like a snake wound to and fro across it. At one point it crawled sideways 
right to the edge of the dark chasm, and Frodo glancing down saw below him 
as a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the Morgul Valley. Down 
in its depths glimmered like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the 
dead city to the Nameless Pass. He turned hastily away. 

Still on and up the stairway bent and crawled, until at last with a 
final flight, short and straight, it climbed out again on to another level. 

The path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now 
followed its own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the 
higher regions of the Ephel D®ath. Dimly the hobbits could discern tall 
piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side, between which were great 
crevices and fissures blacker than the night, where forgotten winters had 
gnawed and carved the sunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed 
stronger; though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed 
coming to this place of shadow, or whether they saw only the flame of some 
great violence of Sauron in the torment of Gorgoroth beyond. Still far 
ahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very 
crown of this bitter road. Against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a 
cleft was outlined in the topmost ridge, narrow, deep-cloven between two 




black shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone. 

He paused and looked more attentively. The horn upon the left was tall 
and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land 
beyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it was a black tower poised 
above the outer pass. He touched Sam's arm and pointed. 

'I don’t like the look of that! ' said Sam. 'So this secret way of 
yours is guarded after all,' he growled, turning to Gollum. 'As you knew all 
along, I suppose? ' 

'All ways are watched, yes,' said Gollum. 'Of course they are. But 
hobbits must try some way. This may be least watched. Perhaps they've all 
gone away to big battle, perhaps ! ' 

'Perhaps,' grunted Sam. 'Well, it still seems a long way off, and a 
long way up before we get there. And there's still the tunnel. I think you 
ought to rest now, Mr. Frodo. I don't know what time of day or night it is, 
but we've kept going for hours and hours.' 

'Yes, we must rest,’ said Frodo. 'Let us find some corner out of the 
wind, and gather our strength-for the last lap.' For so he felt it to be. 

The terrors of the land beyond, and the deed to be done there, seemed 
remote, too far off yet to trouble him. All his mind was bent on getting 
through or over this impenetrable wall and guard. If once he could do that 
impossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it 
seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness, still labouring in the stony 
shadows under Cirith Ungol. 

In a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: Frodo 
and Sam a little way within, and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the 
opening. There the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal 
before they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they 
would 

ever eat together. Some of the food of Gondor they ate, and wafers of the 
waybread of the Elves, and they drank a little. But of their water they were 
sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths. 

'I wonder when we'll find water again? ' said Sam. 'But I suppose even 
over there they drink? Ores drink, don't they? ' 

'Yes, they drink,' said Frodo. 'But do not let us speak of that. Such 
drink is not for us.' 

'Then all the more need to fill our bottles,' said Sam. 'But there 
isn't any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have I heard. And anyway 




Faramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.' 

'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,' said Frodo. 'We 
are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing 
into it and not out of it.' 

'I wouldn't trust it,' said Sam, 'not till I was dying of thirst. 

There's a wicked feeling about this place.' Fie sniffed. 'And a smell, I 
fancy. Do you notice it? A queer kind of a smell, stuffy. I don't like it.' 

'I don't like anything here at all.' said Frodo, 'step or stone, breath 
or bone. Earth, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.’ 

'Yes, that's so,' said Sam. 'And we shouldn't be here at all, if we'd 
known more about it before we started. But I suppose it's often that way. 
The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I 
used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk 
of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because 
they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might 
say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or 
the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, 
usually — their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they 
had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they 
had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about 
those as just went on — and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not 
to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, 
coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same — like 
old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they 
may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've 
fallen into? ' 

'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real 
tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of 
a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. 

And you don't want them to.' 

'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to 
get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and 
that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long 
tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it 
— and the Silmaril went on and came to Edrendil. And why, sir, I never 
thought of that before! We've got — you've got some of the light of it in 
that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the 




same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end? ' 

'No, they never end as tales,' said Frodo. 'But the people in them 
come, and go when their part's ended. Our part will end later — or sooner.' 

'And then we can have some rest and some sleep,' said Sam. He laughed 
grimly. 'And I mean just that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain ordinary rest, and 
sleep, and waking up to a morning's work in the garden. I'm afraid that's 
all I'm hoping for all the time. All the big important plans are not for my 
sort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales. We're in 
one, or course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside, 
or read out of a great big book with red and black letters, years and years 
afterwards. And people will say: "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring! " And 
they'll say: "Yes, that's one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave, 
wasn't he, dad?" "Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that's 
saying a lot.'" 

'It's saying a lot too much,' said Frodo, and he laughed, a long clear 
laugh from his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since 
Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones 
were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them. But Frodo did not heed 
them; he laughed again. 'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me 
as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the 
chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. "I want to hear more about Sam, 
dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it 
makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he, 
dad? 

ft f 

'Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious. ' 

'So was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am. We're going on a bit too fast. 

You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is 
all too likely that some will say at this point: "Shut the book now, dad; we 
don't want to read any more." ' 

'Maybe,' said Sam, 'but I wouldn't be one to say that. Things done and 
over and made into part of the great tales are different. Why, even Gollum 
might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he 
used to like tales himself once, by his own account. I wonder if he thinks 
he's the hero or the villain? 

'Gollum!' he called. 'Would you like to be the hero — now where's he 
got to again?' 




There was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the 
shadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a 
mouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep: They had 
supposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day 
before had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently 
slipped off again while they talked. But what for this time? 

'I don't like his sneaking off without saying,' said Sam. 'And least of 
all now. He can't be looking for food up here, not unless there's some kind 
of rock he fancies. Why, there isn't even a bit of moss! ' 

"It's no good worrying about him now,' said Frodo. 'We couldn't have 
got so far, not even within sight of the pass, without him, and so we'll 
have to put up with his ways. If he's false, he's false.' 

'All the same, I'd rather have him under my eye,' said Sam. 'All the 
more so, if he's false. Do you remember he never would say if this pass was 
guarded or no? And now we see a tower there — and it may be deserted, and 
it may not. Do you think he's gone to fetch them, Ores or whatever they 
are?' 

'No, I don't think so,' answered Frodo. 'Even if he's up to some 
wickedness, and I suppose that's not unlikely, I don't think it's that: not 
to fetch Ores, or any servants of the Enemy. Why wait till now, and go 
through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land he fears? He 
could probably have betrayed us to Ores many times since we met him. No, if 
it's anything, it will be some little private trick of his own-that he 
thinks is quite secret.' 

'Well, I suppose you're right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'Not that it 
comforts me mightily. I don't make no mistake: I don't doubt he'd hand me 
over to Ores as gladly as kiss his hand. But I was forgetting — his 
Precious. No, I suppose the whole time it's been The Precious for poor 
Smjagol. That's the one idea in all his little schemes, if he has any. But 
how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than I can guess.' 

'Very likely he can't guess himself,' said Frodo. 'And I don't think 
he's got just one plain scheme in his muddled head. I think he really is in 
part trying to save the Precious from the Enemy, as long as he can. For that 
would be the last disaster for himself too. if the Enemy got it. And in the 
other part, perhaps, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance.' 

'Yes, Slinker and Stinker, as I've said before,' said Sam. 'But the 
nearer they get to the Enemy's land the more like Stinker Slinker will get. 




Mark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he won't let us really take the 
precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble.' 

'We haven't got there yet,' said Frodo. 

'No, but we'd better keep our eyes skinned till we do. If we're caught 
napping, Stinker will come out on top pretty quick. Not but what it would be 
safe for you to have a wink now, master. Safe, if you lay close to me. I'd 
be dearly glad to see you have a sleep. I'd keep watch over you; and anyway, 
if you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you 
without 

your Sam knowing it.' 

'Sleep!' said Frodo and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a 
mirage of cool green. 'Yes, even here I could sleep.' 

'Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.' 

And so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and 
creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat propped against the 
stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay 
Frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of 
Sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace 
was in both their faces. 

Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry 
face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and 
tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back 
up towards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some interior 
debate. Then he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very 
cautiously he touched Frodo's knee — but almost the touch was a caress. For 
a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have 
thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had 
carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and 
streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing. 

But at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep, and 
immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum — 
'pawing 

at master,’ as he thought. 

'Hey you!’ he said roughly. 'What are you up to?’ 

'Nothing, nothing,' said Gollum softly. 'Nice Master!' 

'I daresay,' said Sam. 'But where have you been to — sneaking off and 
sneaking back, you old villain? ' 




Gollum withdrew himself, and a green glint flickered under his heavy 
lids. Almost spider -like he looked now, crouched back on his bent limbs, 
with his protruding eyes. The fleeting moment had passed, beyond recall. 
'Sneaking, sneaking!' he hissed. 'Hobbits always so polite, yes. O nice 
hobbits! Smjagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find. 
Tired he is, thirsty he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches 
for paths, and they say sneak, sneak. Very nice friends, O yes my precious, 
very nice.' 

Sam felt a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. 'Sorry.' he said. 

'I'm sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. And I shouldn't have been 
sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp. But Mr. Frodo. he's that tired, I 
asked him to have a wink; and well, that's how it is. Sorry. But where have 
you been to? ' 

'Sneaking,' said Gollum, and the green glint did not leave his eyes. 

'O very well,' said Sam, 'have it your own way! I don't suppose it's so 
far from the truth. And now we'd better all be sneaking along together. 
What's the time? Is it today or tomorrow? ' 

'It's tomorrow,' said Gollum, 'or this was tomorrow when hobbits went 
to sleep. Very foolish, very dangerous-if poor Smjagol wasn't sneaking about 
to watch.' 

'I think we shall get tired of that word soon,’ said Sam. 'But never 
mind. I'll wake master up.' Gently he smoothed the hair back from Frodo's 
brow, and bending down spoke softly to him. 

'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! ' 

Frodo stirred and opened his eyes, and smiled, seeing Sam's face 
bending over him. 'Calling me early aren't you, Sam?' he said. 'It's dark 
still! ' 

'Yes it's always dark here,' said Sam. 'But Gollum' s come back Mr. 
Frodo, and he says it's tomorrow. So we must be walking on. The last lap.' 

Frodo drew a deep breath and sat up. 'The last lap! ’ he said. 'Hullo, 
Smjagol! Found any food? Have you had any rest? ' 

'No food, no rest, nothing for Smjagol,' said Gollum. 'He's a sneak.' 

Sam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself. 

'Don't take names to yourself, Smjagol,' said Frodo. 'It's unwise 
whether they are true or false.' 

'Smjagol has to take what's given him,' answered Gollum. 'He was given 
that name by kind Master Samwise, the hobbit that knows so much.' 




Frodo looked at Sam. 'Yes sir,' he said. 'I did use the word, waking up 
out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand. I said I was sorry, 
but I soon shan't be.' 

'Come, let it pass then,' said Frodo. 'But now we seem to have come to 
the point, you and I, Smjagol. Tell me. Can we find the rest of the way by 
ourselves? We're in sight of the pass, of a way in, and if we can find it 
now, then I suppose our agreement can be said to be over. You have done what 
you promised, and you're free: free to go back to food and rest, wherever 
you wish to go, except to servants of the Enemy. And one day I may reward 
you, I or those that remember me.' 

'No, no, not yet,' Gollum whined. 'O no! They can't find the way 
themselves, can they? O no indeed. There's the tunnel coming. Smjagol must 
go on. No rest. No food. Not yet.' 




Chapter 9 . Shelob ' s Lair 



It may indeed have been daytime now, as Gollum said, but the hobbits 
could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above was less 
utterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while instead of the 
darkness of deep night, which lingered still in cracks and holes, a grey 
blurring shadow shrouded the stony world about them. They passed on, 
Gollum 

in front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the 
piers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing like huge unshapen 
statues on either hand. There was no sound. Some way ahead, a mile or so, 
perhaps, was a great grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of 
mountain- stone. Darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, 
until it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay 
beyond. Deep shadow lay before its feet. Sam sniffed the air. 

'Ugh! That smell!' he said. 'It's getting stronger and stronger.' 

Presently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they 
saw the opening of a cave. 'This is the way in,' said Gollum softly. 'This 
is the entrance to the tunnel.' He did not speak its name: Torech Ungol, 
Shelob's Lair. Out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the 
meads of Morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth unnameable were piled and 
hoarded in the dark within. 

'Is this the only way, Smjagol? ’ said Frodo. 

'Yes, yes,' he answered. 'Yes, we must go this way now.' 

'D'you mean to say you've been through this hole?' said Sam. 'Phew! But 
perhaps you don't mind bad smells.' 

Gollum's eyes glinted. 'He doesn't know what we minds, does he 
precious? No, he doesn't. But Smjagol can bear things. Yes. He's been 
through. O yes, right through. It's the only way.' 

'And what makes the smell, I wonder,' said Sam. 'It's like — well, I 
wouldn't like to say. Some beastly hole of the Ores, I'll warrant, with a 
hundred years of their filth in it.' 

'Well,' said Frodo, 'Ores or no, if it's the only way, we must take 
it.' 

Drawing a deep breath they passed inside. In a few steps they were in 




utter and impenetrable dark. Not since the lightless passages of Moria had 
Frodo or Sam known such darkness, and if possible here it was deeper and 
denser. There, there were airs moving, and echoes, and a sense of space. 

Here the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as 
it were in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itself that, as it 
was breathed, brought blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind, so 
that even the memory of colours and of forms and of any light faded out of 
thought. Night always had been, and always would be, and night was all. 

But for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their 
feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls felt, 
to their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was 
straight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope. The tunnel was 
high and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits walked abreast, only 
touching the side- walls with their outstretched hands, they were separated, 
cut off alone in the darkness. 

Gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. While 
they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath 
hissing and gasping just in front of them. But after a time their senses 
became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept on, 
groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they 
had entered, will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate 
beyond. 

Before they had gone very far, perhaps, but time and distance soon 
passed out of his reckoning, Sam on the right, feeling the wall, was aware 
that there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath 
of some air less heavy, and then they passed it by. 

'There's more than one passage here,' he whispered with an effort: it 
seemed hard to make his breath give any sound. 'It's as ore-like a place as 
ever there could be ! ' 

After that, first he on the right, and then Frodo on the left, passed 
three or four such openings, some wider, some smaller; but there was as yet 
no doubt of the main way, for it was straight, and did not turn, and still 
went steadily up. But how long was it, how much more of this would they have 
to endure, or could they endure? The breathlessness of the air was growing 
as they climbed; and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some 
resistance thicker than the foul air. As they thrust forward they felt 
things brush against their heads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or 




hanging growths perhaps: they could not tell what they were. And still the 
stench grew. It grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only 
clear sense left t0 them, and that was for their torment. One hour, two 
hours, three hours: how many had they passed in this lightless hole? 
Hours-days, weeks rather. Sam left the tunnel-side and shrank towards Frodo, 
and their hands met and clasped, and so together they still went on. 

At length Frodo, groping along the left-hand wall, came suddenly to a 
void. Almost he fell sideways into the emptiness. Here was some opening in 
the rock far wider than any they had yet passed; and out of it came a reek 
so foul, and a sense of lurking malice so intense, that Frodo reeled. And at 
that moment Sam too lurched and fell forwards. 

Fighting off both the sickness and the fear, Frodo gripped Sam's hand. 
'Up! ' he said in a hoarse breath without voice. 'It all comes from here, 
the stench and the peril. Now for it! Quick! ' 

Calling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged Sam to his 
feet, and forced his own limbs to move. Sam stumbled beside him. One step, 
two steps, three steps-at last six steps. Maybe they had passed the dreadful 
unseen opening, but whether that was so or not, suddenly it was easier to 
move, as if some hostile will for the moment had released them. They 
struggled on, still hand in hand. 

But almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel forked, or 
so it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way, 
or which kept nearer to the straight. Which should they take, the left, or 
the right? They knew of nothing to guide them, yet a false choice would 
almost certainly be fatal. 

'Which way has Gollum gone? ' panted Sam. 'And why didn't he wait? ' 

'Smjagol! ’said Frodo, trying to call. ’Smjagol! ’ But his voice 
croaked, and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips. There was no 
answer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air. 

'He's really gone this time, I fancy,' muttered Sam. 'I guess this is 
just exactly where he meant to bring us. Gollum! If ever I lay hands on you 
again, you'll be sorry for it.' 

Presently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the 
opening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great 
stone had fallen in the passage. 'This can't be the way,' Frodo whispered. 
'Right or wrong, we must take the other.' 

'And quick! ' Sam panted. 'There's something worse than Gollum about. I 




can feel something looking at us.' 

They had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a 
sound, startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling, 
bubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. They wheeled round, but nothing 
could be seen. Still as stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not 
know what. 

'It's a trap!’ said Sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his 
sword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it 
came. ’I wish old Tom was near us now!’ he thought. Then as he stood, 
darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart, it 
seemed to him that he saw a light: a light in his mind, almost unbearably 
bright at first, as a sun-ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless 
pit. Then the light became colour: green, gold, silver, white. Far off, as 
in a little picture drawn by elven-fingers he saw the Lady Galadriel 
standing on the grass in Lurien, and gifts were in her hands. And you, 
Ring-bearer, he heard her say, remote but clear , for you I have prepared 
this. 

The bubbling hiss drew nearer, and there was a creaking as of some 
great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark. A reek came on 
before it. 'Master, master!' cried Sam, and the life and urgency came back 
into his voice. 'The Lady's gift! The star-glass! A light to you in dark 
places, she said it was to be. The star-glass! ' 

'The star-glass?' muttered Frodo, as one answering out of sleep, hardly 
comprehending. 'Why yes! Why had I forgotten it? A light when all other 
lights go out! And now indeed light alone can help us.’ 

Slowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held aloft the Phial 
of Galadriel. For a moment it glimmered, faint as a rising star struggling 
in heavy earthward mists, and then as its power waxed, and hope grew in 
Frodo's mind, it began to burn, and kindled to a silver flame, a minute 
heart of dazzling light, as though Edrendil had himself come down from the 
high sunset paths with the last Silmaril upon his brow. The darkness receded 
from it until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal, 
and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire. 

Frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so long 
carried, not guessing its full worth and potency. Seldom had he remembered 
it on the road, until they came to Morgul Vale, and never had he used it for 
fear of its revealing light. Aiya Edrendil Elenion Ancalima! he cried, and 




knew not what he had spoken; for it seemed that another voice spoke through 
his, clear, untroubled by the foul air of the pit. 

But other potencies there are in Middle-earth, powers of night, and 
they are old and strong. And She that walked in the darkness had heard the 
Elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time, and she had not heeded it, 
and it did not daunt her now. Even as Frodo spoke he felt a great malice 
bent upon him, and a deadly regard considering him. Not far down the tunnel, 
between them and the opening where they had reeled and stumbled, he was 
aware of eyes growing visible, two great clusters of many-windowed eyes — 
the coming menace was unmasked at last. The radiance of the star-glass was 
broken and thrown back from their thousand facets, but behind the glitter a 
pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame kindled in some deep 
pit of evil thought. Monstrous and abominable eyes they were, bestial and 
yet filled with purpose and with hideous delight, gloating over their prey 
trapped beyond all hope of escape. 

Frodo and Sam, horror-stricken, began slowly to back away, their own 
gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so 
the eyes advanced. Frodo's hand wavered, and slowly the Phial drooped. Then 
suddenly, released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain 
panic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but 
even as they ran Frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes 
came leaping up behind. The stench of death was like a cloud about him. 

’Stand! stand! ' he cried desperately. 'Running is no use.’ 

Slowly the eyes crept nearer. 

'Galadriel! ' he called, and gathering his courage he lifted up the 
Phial once more. The eyes halted. For a moment their regard relaxed, as if 
some hint of doubt troubled them. Then Frodo's heart flamed within him, and 
without thinking what he did, whether it was folly or despair or courage, he 
took the Phial in his left hand, and with his right hand drew his sword. 

Sting flashed out, and the sharp elven-blade sparkled in the silver light, 
but at its edges a blue fire flicked. Then holding the star aloft and the 
bright sword advanced, Frodo, hobbit of the Shire, walked steadily down to 
meet the eyes. 

They wavered. Doubt came into them as the light approached. One by one 
they dimmed, and slowly they drew back. No brightness so deadly had ever 
afflicted them before. From sun and moon and star they had been safe 
underground, but now a star had descended into the very earth. Still it 




approached, and the eyes began to quail. One by one they all went dark; they 
turned away, and a great bulk, beyond the light's reach, heaved its huge 
shadow in between. They were gone. 

'Master, master!' cried Sam. He was close behind, his own sword drawn 
and ready. 'Stars and glory! But the Elves would make a song of that, if 
ever they heard of it! And may I live to tell them and hear them sing. But 
don't go on, master. Don't go down to that den! Now's our only chance. Now 
let's get out of this foul hole!' 

And so back they turned once more, first walking and then running; for 
as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply, and with every stride 
they climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen lair, and strength 
returned to limb and heart. But still the hatred of the Watcher lurked 
behind them, blind for a while, perhaps, but undefeated, still bent on 
death. And now there came a flow of air to meet them, cold and thin. The 
opening, the tunnel's end, at last it was before them. Panting, yearning for 
a roofless place, they flung themselves forward, and then in amazement they 
staggered, tumbling back. The outlet was blocked with some barrier, but not 
of stone: soft and a little yielding it seemed, and yet strong and 
impervious; air filtered through, hut not a glimmer of any light. Once more 
they charged and were hurled back. 

Holding aloft the Phial Frodo looked and before him he saw a greyness 
which the radiance of the star -glass did not pierce and did not illuminate, 
as if it were a shadow that being cast by no light, no light could 
dissipate. Across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun, 
orderly as the web of some huge spider, but denser-woven and far greater, 
and each thread was as thick as rope. 

Sam laughed grimly. 'Cobwebs!' he said. 'Is that all? Cobwebs! But 
what a spider! Have at 'em, down with 'em! ' 

In a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he 
struck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked 
bowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. Three times 
Sam struck with all his force, and at last one single cord of all the 
countless cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through the air. 
One end of it lashed Sam's hand, and he cried out in pain, starting back and 
drawing his hand across his mouth. 

'It will take days to clear the road like this,' he said. 'What's to be 
done? Have those eyes come back? ' 




'No, not to be seen,' said Frodo. 'But I still feel that they are 
looking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, perhaps. If 
this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.' 

'Trapped in the end! ' said Sam bitterly, his anger rising again above 
weariness and despair. 'Gnats in a net. May the curse of Faramir bite that 
Gollum and bite him quick! ’ 

'That would not help us now,' said Frodo. 'Come! Let us see what Sting 
can do. It is an elven-blade. There were webs of horror in the dark ravines 
of Beleriand where it was forged. But you must be the guard and hold back 
the eyes. Here, take the star-glass. Do not be afraid. Hold it up and 
watch!' 

Then Frodo stepped up to the great grey net, and hewed it with a wide 
sweeping stroke, drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of 
close-strung cords, and at once springing away. The blue-gleaming blade 
shore through them like a scythe through grass, and they leaped and writhed 
and then hung loose. A great rent was made. 

Stroke after stroke he dealt, until at last all the web within his 
reach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil 
in the incoming wind. The trap was broken. 

'Come! ' cried Frodo. 'On! On! ' Wild joy at their escape from the very 
mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind. His head whirled as with a 
draught of potent wine. He sprang out, shouting as he came. 

It seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through 
the den of night. The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last 
hours of a sombre day were passing; the red glare of Mordor had died away in 
sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden 
hope. Almost he had reached the summit of the wall. Only a little higher 
now. The Cleft, Cirith Ungol, was before him, a dim notch in the black 
ridge, and the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side. A short 
race, a sprinter's course and he would be through! 

'The pass, Sam! ’ he cried, not heeding the shrillness of his voice, 
that released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and 
wild. 'The pass ! Run, run, and we'll be through-through before any one can 
stop us! ' 

Sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs; but glad as he 
was to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on glancing back at 
the dark arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some shape beyond his 




imagining, spring out in pursuit. Too little did he or his master know of 
the craft of Shelob. She had many exits from her lair. 

There agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-form, even such as 
once of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under 
the Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains of Terror in Doriath, and so 
came to L®thien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight 
long 

ago. How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the 
Dark Years few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there 
before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dyr; and she served none 
but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with 
endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living 
things were her food, and her vomit darkness. Far and wide her lesser 
broods, bastards of the miserable mates, her own offspring, that she slew, 
spread from glen to glen, from the Ephel D®ath to the eastern hills, to Dol 
Guldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood. But none could rival her, Shelob the 
Great, last child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world. 

Already, years before, Gollum had beheld her, Smjagol who pried into 
all dark holes, and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her, and the 
darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness 
beside him, cutting him off from light and from regret. And he had promised 
to bring her food. But her lust was not his lust. Little she knew of or 
cared for towers, or rings, or anything devised by mind or hand, who only 
desired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life, 
alone, swollen till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the 
darkness could not contain her. 

But that desire was yet far away, and long now had she been hungry, 
lurking in her den, while the power of Sauron grew, and light and living 
things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and no Elf 
or Man came near, only the unhappy Ores. Poor food and wary. But she must 
eat, and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and 
from their tower, ever she found some way to snare them. But she lusted for 
sweeter meat. And Gollum had brought it to her. 

'We'll see, we’ll see,' he said often to himself, when the evil mood 
was on him, as he walked the dangerous road from Emyn Muil to Morgul 
Vale, 

'we'll see. It may well be, O yes, it may well be that when She throws away 




the bones and the empty garments, we shall find it, we shall get it, the 
Precious, a reward for poor Smjagol who brings nice food. And we'll save the 
Precious, as we promised. O yes. And when we’ve got it safe, then She'll 
know it, O yes, then we'll pay Her back, my precious. Then we'll pay 
everyone back! ' 

So he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning, which he still hoped 
to hide from her, even when he had come to her again and had bowed low 
before her while his companions slept. 

And as for Sauron: he knew where she lurked. It pleased him that she 
should dwell there hungry but unabated in malice, a more sure watch upon 
that ancient path into his land than any other that his skill could have 
devised. And Ores, they were useful slaves, but he had them in plenty. If 
now and again Shelob caught them to stay her appetite, she was welcome: he 
could spare them. And sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat ( his 
cat he calls her, but she owns him not) Sauron would send her prisoners that 
he had no better uses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and report 
brought back to him of the play she made. 

So they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no 
assault, nor wrath, nor any end of their wickedness. Never yet had any fly 
escaped from Shelob's webs, and the greater now was her rage and hunger. 

But nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did 
poor Sam know, except that a fear was growing on him, a menace which he 
could not see; and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him 
to run, and his feet seemed leaden. 

Dread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master 
was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them. Turning his eyes away 
from the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left, 
he looked ahead, and he saw two things that increased his dismay. He saw 
that the sword which Frodo still held unsheathed was glittering with blue 
flame; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark, still the window 
in the tower was glowing red. 

'Ores!' he muttered. 'We'll never rush it like this. There's Ores 
about, and worse than Ores.' Then returning quickly to his long habit of 
secrecy, he closed his hand about the precious Phial which he still bore. 

Red with his own living blood his hand shone for a moment, and then he 
thrust the revealing light deep into a pocket near his breast and drew his 
elven-cloak about him. Now he tried to quicken his pace. His master was 




gaining on him; already he was some twenty strides ahead, flitting on like a 
shadow; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world. 

Hardly had Sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came. A 
little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a black hole 
of shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld, 
horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but 
huger than the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of 
the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Those same eyes that he had 
thought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again, 
clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short 
stalk -like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and 
sagging between her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid 
marks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a 
stench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back, 
and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg’s end there was 
a claw. 

As soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded 
limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a horrible speed, 
now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. She was 
between 

Sam and his master. Either she did not see Sam, or she avoided him for the 
moment as the bearer of the light' and fixed all her intent upon one prey, 
upon Frodo, bereft of his Phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet 
of his peril. Swiftly he ran, but Shelob was swifter; in a few leaps she 
would have him. 

Sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. 'Look out 
behind! ' he yelled. ’Look out master! I'm' — but suddenly his cry was 
stifled. 

A long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the 
neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg. Taken off his guard he 
toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker. 

'Got him! ' hissed Gollum in his ear. 'At last, my precious, we’ve got 
him, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She'll get the other. O yes, 
Shelob will get him, not Smjagol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all. 
But he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' He spat on Sam's neck. 

Fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was 
in deadly peril, gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that was far 




beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he 
thought him. Not Gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more 
fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged 
forward 

again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in 
his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was Faramir's staff. 
Desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum was too quick. 
His long right arm shot out, and he grabbed Sam's wrist: his fingers were 
like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till 
with a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all 
the while Gollum's other hand was tightening on Sam's throat. 

Then Sam played his last trick. With all his strength he pulled away 
and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the 
ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards. 

Not expecting even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell over with 
Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach. 

A sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his hand upon Sam's throat 
loosened; but his fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam tore himself 
forward and away, and stood up, and then quickly he wheeled away to his 
right, pivoted on the wrist held by Gollum. Laying hold of the staff with 
his left hand, Sam swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on 
Gollum's outstretched arm, just below the elbow. 

With a squeal Gollum let go. Then Sam waded in; not waiting to change 
the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick as a snake 
Gollum slithered aside, and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his 
back. The staff cracked and broke. That was enough for him. Grabbing from 
behind was an old game of his, and seldom had he failed in it. But this 
time, misled by spite, he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating 
before he had both hands on his victim's neck. Everything had gone wrong 
with his beautiful plan, since that horrible light had so unexpectedly 
appeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a furious enemy, 
little less than his own size. This fight was not for him. Sam swept up his 
sword from the ground and raised it. Gollum squealed, and springing aside on 
to all fours, he jumped away in one big bound like a frog. Before Sam could 
reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel. 

Sword in hand Sam went after him. For the moment he had forgotten 
everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum. 




But before he could overtake him, Gollum was gone. Then as the dark hole 
stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder 
the thought of Frodo and the monster smote upon Sam's mind. He spun round, 
and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. He was 
too late. So far Gollum's plot had succeeded. 




Chapter 10. The Choices of Master Samwise 



Frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending 
over him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of Sam and his 
cries, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he saw that Frodo was 
already bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the 
monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his 
body away. 

On the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his elven-blade, 
where it had fallen useless from his grasp. Sam did not wait to wonder what 
was to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. He 
sprang forward with a yell, and seized his master's sword in his left hand. 
Then he charged. No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world 
of beasts; where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth 
alone, will spring upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its 
fallen mate. 

Disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned 
slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was 
aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless 
years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw. Sam 
sprang in, inside the arches of her legs, and with a quick upthrust of his 
other hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head. One great 
eye went dark. 

Now the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment out of 
the reach of her sting and of her claws. Her vast belly was above him with 
its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury 
held for one more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothering him 
and all his little impudence of courage, he slashed the bright elven-blade 
across her with desperate strength. 

But Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her 
eyes. Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever 
thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. The blade scored 
it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any 
strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should forge the steel or the hand 
of Beren or of T®rin wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up 




the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head. Poison frothed and bubbled 
from the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on 
him 

again. Too soon. For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own 
sword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fending off 
that ghastly roof; and so Shelob, with the driving force of her own cruel 
will, with strength greater than any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a 
bitter spike. Deep, deep it pricked, as Sam was crushed slowly to the 
ground. 

No such anguish had Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all 
her long world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old Gondor, nor 
the most savage Ore entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to 
her beloved flesh. A shudder went through her. Heaving up again, wrenching 
away from the pain, she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang 
backwards in a convulsive leap. 

Sam had fallen to his knees by Frodo's head, his senses reeling in the 
foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. Through the 
mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of Frodo's face and stubbornly he 
fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon 
him. Slowly he raised his head and saw her, only a few paces away, eyeing 
him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom, and a green ooze trickling from 
below her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed 
upon 

the ground, the great bows of her legs quivering, as she gathered herself 
for another spring-this time to crush and sting to death: no little bite of 
poison to still the struggling of her meat; this time to slay and then to 
rend. 

Even as Sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing his death in her 
eyes, a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken, and he 
fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and 
hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror, the 
Phial of Galadriel. 

'Galadriel! ' he said faintly, and then he heard voices far off but 
clear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved 
shadows of the Shire, and the music of the Elves as it came through his 
sleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond. 

Gilthoniel A Elberethl 




And then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which 
he did not know: 

A Elbereth Gilthoniel 

o menel palan-diriel, 

le nallon sn di'nguruthos! 

A tiro nin, Fanuilos! 

And with that he staggered to his feet and was Sam wise the hobbit, 
Hamfast's son, again. 

'Now come, you filth!' he cried. 'You've hurt my master, you brute, and 
you'll pay for it. We're going on; but we'll settle with you first. Come on, 
and taste it again!' 

As if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass 
blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. It flamed like a star that 
leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. No 
such terror out of heaven had ever burned in Shelob's face before. The beams 
of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain, and 
the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye. She fell back 
beating the air with her forelegs, her sight blasted by inner lightnings, 
her mind in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and 
began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind. 

Sam came on. He was reeling like a drunken man, but he came on. And 
Shelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered as she tried 
to hasten from him. She reached the hole, and squeezing down, leaving a 
trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as Sam hewed a last stroke 
at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground. 

Shelob was gone; and whether she lay long in her lair, nursing her 
malice and her misery, and in slow years of darkness healed herself from 
within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun 
once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the Mountains of Shadow, this 
tale does not tell. 

Sam was left alone. Wearily, as the evening of the Nameless Land fell 
upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master. 

'Master, dear master,' he said, but Frodo did not speak. As he had run 
forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, Shelob with hideous speed had come 
behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale, 
and heard no voice, and did not move. 

'Master, dear master! ’ said Sam, and through a long silence waited. 




listening in vain. 

Then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his 
head upon Frodo's breast and to his mouth, but no stir of life could he 
find, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. Often he chafed his 
master's hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold. 

'Frodo, Mr. Frodo! ' he called. 'Don't leave me here alone! It's your 
Sam calling. Don't go where I can't follow! Wake up, Mr. Frodo! O wake up, 
Frodo, me dear, me dear. Wake up!' 

Then anger surged over hint, and he ran about his master's body in a 
rage, stabbing the air, and smiting the stones, and shouting challenges. 
Presently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo's face, pale beneath him 
in the dusk. And suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was 
revealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in Lurien: Frodo with a pale face 
lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had thought 
then. 'He's dead! ' he said. 'Not asleep, dead! ' And as he said it, as if 
the words had set the venom to its work again, it seemed to him that the hue 
of the face grew livid green. 

And then black despair came down on him, and Sam bowed to the ground, 
and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into his heart, and he 
knew no more. 

When at last the blackness passed, Sam looked up and shadows were about 
him; but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he 
could not tell. He was still in the same place, and still his master lay 
beside him dead. The mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into 
ruin. 

'What shall I do, what shall I do? ' he said. 'Did I come all this way 
with him for nothing? ’ And then he remembered his own voice speaking 
words 

that at the time he did not understand himself, at the beginning of their 
journey: I have something to do before the end. I must see it through, sir, 
if you understand. 

'But what can I do? Not leave Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on the top of 
the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?’ he repeated, and for a 
moment 

doubt and fear shook him. 'Go on? Is that what I've got to do? And leave 
him?' 

Then at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body, 




and folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped his cloak about him; 
and he laid his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given 
at the other. 

'If I’m to go on,' he said, 'then I must take your sword, by your 
leave, Mr. Frodo, but I'll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the old 
king in the barrow; and you've got your beautiful mithril coat from old Mr. 
Bilbo. And your star-glass, Mr. Frodo, you did lend it to me and I'll need 
it, for I'll be always in the dark now. It's too good for me, and the Lady 
gave it to you, but maybe she'd understand. Do you understand, Mr. Frodo? 
I've got to go on.' 

But he could not go, not yet. He knelt and held Frodo's hand and could 
not release it. And time went by and still he knelt, holding his master's 
hand, and in his heart keeping a debate. 

Now he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely 
journey — for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger would bear him down 
all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Gollum. Then 
Gollum would die in a corner. But that was not what he had set out to do. It 
would not be worth while to leave his master for that. It would not bring 
him back. Nothing would. They had better both be dead together. And that too 
would be a lonely journey. 

He looked on the bright point of the sword. He thought of the places 
behind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness. 
There was no escape that way. That was to do nothing, not even to grieve. 
That was not what he had set out to do. 'What am I to do then? ' he cried 
again, and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer: see it through. 
Another lonely journey, and the worst. 

'What? Me, alone, go to the Crack of Doom and all? ' He quailed still, 
but the resolve grew. 'What? Me take the Ring from him ? The Council gave it 
to him.’ 

But the answer came at once: 'And the Council gave him companions, so 
that the errand should not fail. And you are the last of all the Company. 

The errand must not fail.' 

'I wish I wasn't the last,' he groaned. 'I wish old Gandalf was hare or 
somebody. Why am I left all alone to make up my mind? I’m sure to go wrong. 
And it's not for me to go taking the Ring, putting myself forward.' 

'But you haven't put yourself forward; you've been put forward. And as 
for not being the right and proper person, why, Mr. Frodo wasn't as you 




might say, nor Mr. Bilbo. They didn’t choose themselves.' 

'Ah well, I must make up my own mind. I will make it up. But I'll be 
sure to go wrong: that'd be Sam Gamgee all over. 

'Let me see now: if we're found here, or Mr. Frodo's found, and that 
Thing's on him, well, the Enemy will get it. And that's the end of all of 
us, of Lorien, and Rivendell, and the Shire and all. And there s no time to 
lose, or it'll be the end anyway. The war's begun, and more than likely 
things are all going the Enemy's way already. No chance to go back with It 
and get advice or permission. No, it's sit here till they come and kill me 
over master's body, and gets It: or take It and go.' He drew a deep breath. 

'Then take It, it is ! ' 

He stooped. Very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his 
hand inside Frodo's tunic; then with his other hand raising the head, he 
kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over it. And then the 
head lay quietly back again in rest. No change came over the still face, and 
by that more than by all other tokens Sam was convinced at last that Frodo 
had died and laid aside the Quest. 

'Good-bye, master, my dear! ' he murmured. 'Forgive your Sam. He'll 
come back to this spot when the job's done — if he manages it. And then 
he'll not leave you again. Rest you quiet till I come; and may no foul 
creature come anigh you ! And if the Lady could hear me and give me one wish, 
I would wish to come back and find you again. Good-bye! ' 

And then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it, and at once 
his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the Ring, as if a great 
stone had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the weight became less, or 
new strength grew in him, he raised his head, and then with a great effort 
got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden. And for a 
moment he lifted up the Phial and looked down at his master, and the light 
burned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and 
in that light Frodo's face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an 
elvish beauty, as of one who has long passed the shadows. And with the 
bitter comfort of that last sight Sam turned and hid the light and stumbled 
on into the growing dark. 

He had not far to go. The tunnel was some way behind; the Cleft a 
couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in the dusk' a 
deep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in a long trough 
with cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came to a 




long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the ore-tower was right above him, 
frowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark 
shadow under it. He was coming to the top of the steps and was in the Cleft 
at last. 

'I've made up my mind,' he kept saying to himself. But he had not. 
Though he had done his best to think it out, what he was doing was 
altogether against the grain of his nature. 'Have I got it wrong? ' he 
muttered. 'What ought I to have done? ’ 

As the sheer sides of the Cleft closed about him, before he reached the 
actual summit, before he looked at last on the path descending into the 
Nameless Land, he turned. For a moment, motionless in intolerable doubt, he 
looked back. He could still see, like a small blot in the gathering gloom, 
the mouth of the tunnel; and he thought he could see or guess where Frodo 
lay. He fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down there, or perhaps it 
was some trick of his tears, as he peered out at that high stony place where 
all his life had fallen in ruin. 

’If only I could have my wish, my one wish,’ he sighed, 'to go back and 
find him!' Then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few 
steps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken. 

Only a few steps; and now only a few more and he would be going down 
and would never see that high place again. And then suddenly he heard cries 
and voices. He stood still as stone. Ore- voices. They were behind him and 
before him. A noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: Ores were coming up 
to the Cleft from the far side, from some entry to the tower, perhaps. 
Tramping feet and shouts behind. He wheeled round. He saw small red lights, 
torches, winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel. At last 
the hunt was up. The red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught. 

Now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was 
very near. In a minute they would reach the top and be on him. He had taken 
too long in making up his mind, and now it was no good. How could he escape, 
or save himself, or save the Ring? The Ring. He was not aware of any thought 
or decision. He simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the 
Ring in his hand. The head of the ore-company appeared in the Cleft right 
before him. Then he put it on. 

The world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with an hour 
of thought. At once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was 
dimmed, but otherwise than in Shelob's lair. All things about him now were 




not dark but vague; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world, alone, 
like a small black solid rock and the Ring, weighing down his left hand, was 
like an orb of hot gold. He did not feel invisible at all, but horribly and 
uniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an Eye was searching for him. 

He heard the crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in Morgul 
Vale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of Shelob, groping, 
lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the 
cries of the Ores as they came out of the tunnel; and deafening, roaring in 
his ears, the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the Ores before 
him. He shrank against the cliff. But they marched up like a phantom 
company, grey distorted figures in a mist, only dreams of fear with pale 
flames in their hands. And they passed him by. He cowered, trying to creep 
away into some cranny and to hide. 

He listened. The Ores from the tunnel and the others marching down had 
sighted one another, and both parties were now hurrying and shouting. He 
heard them both clearly, and he understood what they said. Perhaps the Ring 
gave understanding of tongues, or simply understanding, especially of the 
servants of Sauron its maker, so that if he gave heed, he understood and 
translated the thought to himself. Certainly the Ring had grown greatly in 
power as it approached the places of its forging; but one thing it did not 
confer, and that was courage. At present Sam still thought only of hiding, 
of lying low till all was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. He could 
not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears. 

'Hola! Gorbag! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already? ' 

'Orders, you lubber. And what are you doing, Shagrat? Tired of lurking 
up there? Thinking of coming down to fight? ' 

'Orders to you. I'm in command of this pass. So speak civil. What's 
your report? ' 

'Nothing.' 

'Hai! hai! yoi !' A yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders. The 
Ores lower down had suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the 
others. 

'Hai! Hola! Here's something! Lying right in the road. A spy, a spy! ' 

There was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices. 

With a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood. They 
had 

seen his master. What would they do? He had heard tales of the Ores to make 




the blood run cold. It could not be borne. He sprang up. He flung the Quest 
and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them. He knew now where 
his place was and had been: at his master's side, though what he could do 
there was not clear. Back he ran down the steps, down the path towards 
Frodo. 

'How many are there?' he thought. 'Thirty or forty from the tower at 
least, and a lot more than that from down below, I guess. How many can I 
kill before they get me? They'll see the flame of the sword, as soon as I 
draw it, and they'll get me sooner or later. I wonder if any song will ever 
mention it: How Samwise fell in the High Pass and made a wall of bodies 
round his master. No, no song. Of course not, for the Ring'll be found, and 
there'll be no more songs. I can't help it. My place is by Mr. Frodo. They 
must understand that — Elrond and the Council, and the great Lords and 
Ladies with all their wisdom. Their plans have gone wrong. I can't be their 
Ring-bearer. Not without Mr. Frodo.' 

But the Ores were out of his dim sight now. He had had no time to 
consider himself, but now he realized that he was weary, weary almost to 
exhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. He was too slow. The 
path seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist? 

There they were again! A good way ahead still. A cluster of figures 
round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and 
that, bent like dogs on a trail. He tried to make a spurt. 

'Come on, Sam! ' he said, 'or you'll be too late again.' He loosened 
the sword in its sheath. In a minute he would draw it, and then— 

There was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted 
from the ground. 'Ya hoi! Ya harri hoi! Up! Up! ' 

Then a voice shouted: 'Now off! The quick way. Back to the Undergate! 
She'll not trouble us tonight by all the signs.' The whole band of 
ore-figures began to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on 
their shoulders. 'Ya hoi! ’ 

They had taken Frodo's body. They were off. He could not catch them up. 
Still he laboured on. The Ores reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those 
with the burden went first, and behind them there was a good deal of 
struggling and jostling. Sam came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue 
in his wavering hand, but they did not see it. Even as he came panting up, 
the last of them vanished into the black hole. 

For a moment he stood, gasping, clutching his breast. Then he drew his 




sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears. ’Curse 
the filth! ' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness. 

It no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if 
he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. His weariness was 
growing but his will hardened all the more. He thought he could see the 
light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch 
them up. Ores go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well.; for in 
spite of Shelob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from 
the Dead City over the mountains. In what far-off time the main tunnel and 
the great round pit had been made, where Shelob had taken up her abode in 
ages past, they did not know: but many byways they had themselves delved 
about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro 
on the business of their masters. Tonight they did not intend to go far 
down, but were hastening to find a side-passage that led back to their 
watch-tower on the cliff. Must of them were gleeful, delighted with what 
they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the 
fashion of their kind. Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and 
hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the 
rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The captains of the two parties 
seemed to be bringing up the rear, debating as they went. 

’Can't you stop your rabble making such a racket, Shagrat? ' grunted 
the one. 'We don’t want Shelob on us.’ 

'Go on, Gorbag! Yours are making more than half the noise,’ said the 
other. 'But let the lads play! No need to worry about Shelob for a bit, I 
reckon. She’s sat on a nail, it seems, and we shan’t cry about that. Didn’t 
you see: a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers? If 
we’ve stopped it once, we’ve stopped it a hundred times. So let ’em laugh. 
And we’ve struck a bit of luck at last: got something that Lugb®rz wants.’ 
’Lugb®rz wants it, eh? What is it, d’you think? Elvish it looked to me, 
but undersized. What’s the danger in a thing like that? ’ 

’Don’t know till we’ve had a look.’ 

’Oho! So they haven’t told you what to expect? They don’t tell us all 
they know, do they? Not by half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top 
Ones can.’ 

'Sh, Gorbag!’ Shagrat’s voice was lowered, so that even with his 
strangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just catch what was said. ’They 
may, but they’ve got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as 




not. But there's no doubt about it, they're troubled about something. The 
Nazgyl down below are, by your account; and Lugb®rz is too. Something 
nearly 
slipped.’ 

'Nearly, you say! ’ said Gorbag. 

'All right,’ said Shagrat, 'but we’ll talk of that later: Wait till we 
get to the Under-way. There’s a place there where we can talk a bit, while 
the lads go on.’ 

Shortly afterwards Sam saw the torches disappear. Then there was a 
rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as he could guess 
the Ores had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo and he had 
tried and found blocked. It was still blocked. 

There seemed to be a great stone in the way, but the Ores had got 
through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were 
still running along, deeper and deeper into the mountain, back towards the 
tower. Sam felt desperate. They were carrying off his master's body for some 
foul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and 
he threw himself against it, but it did not yield. Then not far inside, or 
so he thought, he heard the two captains' voices talking again. He stood 
still listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful. 

Perhaps Gorbag, who seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and 
he 

could then slip in. 

'No, I don’t know,’ said Gorbag's voice. 'The messages go through 
quicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I don’t enquire how it’s 
done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgyl give me the creeps. And they skin the 
body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on 
the other side. But He likes ’em; they’re His favourites nowadays, so it’s 
no use grumbling. I tell you, it’s no game serving down in the city.’ 

'You should try being up here with Shelob for company,’ said Shagrat. 

’I’d like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em. But the war's on 
now, and when that's over things may be easier.' 

'It's going well, they say.’ 

'They would.’ grunted Gorbag. 'We'll see. But anyway, if it does go 
well, there should be a lot more room. What d’you say? — if we get a 
chance, you and me’ll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few 
trusty lads, somewhere where there's good loot nice and handy, and no big 




bosses.' 

’Ah! ' said Shagrat. 'Like old times.' 

'Yes,' said Gorbag. 'But don't count on it. I'm not easy in my mind. As 
I said, the Big Bosses, ay,' his voice sank almost to a whisper, 'ay, even 
the Biggest, can make mistakes. Something nearly slipped you say. I say, 
something has slipped. And we've got to look out. Always the poor Uruks to 
put slips right, and small thanks. But don't forget: the enemies don't love 
us any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we're done 
too. But see here: when were you ordered out? ' 

'About an hour ago, just before you saw us. A message came: Nazgyl 
uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs. 

I came at once.' 

'Bad business,' said Gorbag. 'See here — our Silent Watchers were 
uneasy more than two days ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out 
for another day, nor any message sent to Lugb®rz either: owing to the Great 
Signal going up, and the High Nazgyl going off to the war, and all that. And 
then they couldn't get Lugb®rz to pay attention for a good while, I'm told.' 

'The Eye was busy elsewhere, I suppose,' said Shagrat. 'Big things 
going on away west, they say.’ 

’I daresay,' growled Gorbag. 'But in the meantime enemies have got up 
the Stairs. And what were you up to? You're supposed to keep watch, aren't 
you, special orders or no? What are you for?' 

'That's enough! Don't try and teach me my job. We were awake all right. 

We knew there were funny things going on.' 

'Very funny! ’ 

'Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But Shelob was on the 
go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.' 

'Her Sneak? What's that? ' 

'You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider 
himself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. He's been here before. Came 
out of Lugb®rz the first time, years ago, and we had word from High Up to 
let him pass. He's been up the Stairs once or twice since then, but we've 
left him alone: seems to have some understanding with Her Ladyship. I 
suppose he's no good to eat: she wouldn't worry about words from High Up. 
But a fine guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all 
this racket. Early last night we saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her 
Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the 




message came. I thought her Sneak had brought her a toy. or that you'd 
perhaps sent her a present, a prisoner of war or something. I don't 
interfere when she's playing. Nothing gets by Shelob when she's on the 
hunt.' 

'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I tell you I'm 
not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did get by. It cut her web 
and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about! ' 

'Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? ' 

' Got him? Got whol This little fellow? But if he was the only one then 
she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now. And 
if Lugb®rz wanted him, you'd have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there 
was more than one.' 

At this point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear 
against the stone. 

'Who cut the cords she'd put round him, Shagrat? Same one as cut the 
web. Didn't you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I 
reckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat? ' 

Shagrat made no reply. 

'You may well put your thinking cap on, if you've got one. It's no 
laughing matter. No one, no one has ever stuck a pin in Shelob before, as 
you should know well enough. There's no grief in that; but think -there's 
someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel 
that ever walked since the bad old times, since the Great Siege. Something 
has slipped.' 

'And what is it then? ' growled Shagrat. 

'By all the signs, Captain Shagrat, I'd say there's a large warrior 
loose, Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: 
and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. Very funny 
indeed! ' Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself. 

'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy view.' said Shagrat. 'You can 
read the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to explain them. 
Anyhow. I've got watchers at every point, and I'm going to deal with one 
thing at a time. When I've had a look at the fellow we have caught, then 
I'll begin to worry 



lcb2 




about something else.' 

It s my guess you won’t find much in that little fellow,' said Gorbag. 

'He may have had nothing to do with the real mischief. The big fellow with 
the sharp sword doesn't seem to have thought him worth much anyhow — just 
left him lying: regular elvish trick.' 

'We'll see. Come on now! We've talked enough. Let's go and have a look 
at the prisoner! 

'What are you going to do with him? Don't forget I spotted him first. 

If there's any game, me and my lads must be in it.' 

'Now, now,' growled Shagrat. 'I have my orders. And it's more than my 
belly's worth, or yours, to break 'em. Any trespasser found by the guard is 
to be held at the tower. Prisoner is to be stripped. Full description of 
every article, garment, weapon, letter, ring, or trinket is to be sent to 
Lugb®rz at once, and to Lugb®rz only. And the prisoner is to be kept safe 
and intact, under pain of death for every member of the guard, until He 
sends or comes Himself. That's plain enough, and that's what I'm going to 
do.' 

'Stripped, eh? ' said Gorbag. 'What, teeth, nails, hair, and all? ' 

'No, none of that. He's for Lugb®rz, I tell you. He's wanted safe and 
whole.' 

'You'll find that difficult,' laughed Gorbag. 'He's nothing but carrion 
now. What Lugb®rz will do with such stuff I can't guess. He might as well go 
in the pot.' 

'You fool,' snarled Shagrat. 'You've been talking very clever, but 
there's a lot you don't know, though most other folk do. You'll be for the 
pot or for Shelob, if you don't take care. Carrion! Is that all you know of 
Her Ladyship? When she binds with cords, she's after meat. She doesn't eat 
dead meat, nor suck cold blood. This fellow isn't dead! ' 

Sam reeled, clutching at the stone. He felt as if the whole dark world 
was turning upside down. So great was the shock that he almost swooned, but 
even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep inside him he was aware 
of the comment: 'You fool, he isn't dead, and your heart knew it. Don't 
trust your head, Samwise, it is not the best part of you. The trouble with 
you is that you never really had any hope. Now what is to be done? ' Fur the 
moment nothing, but to prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen, 
listen to the vile ore- voices. 

'Garn!' said Shagrat. 'She's got more than one poison. When she's 




hunting, she just gives ’em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as boned 
fish, and then she has her way with them. D'you remember old Ufthak? We lost 
him for days. Then we found him in a corner; hanging up he was, but he was 
wide awake and glaring. How we laughed! She’d forgotten him, maybe, but 
we 

didn't touch him-no good interfering with Her. Nar — this little filth, 
he’ll wake up, in a few hours; and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit, 
he'll be all right. Or would be, if Lugb®rz would let him alone. And of 
course, beyond wondering where he is and what's happened to him.’ 

'And what's going to happen to him,' laughed Gorbag. 'We can tell him a 
few stories at any rate, if we can't do anything else. I don't suppose he's 
ever been in lovely Lugb®rz, so he may like to know what to expect. This is 
going to be more funny than I thought. Let's go!' 

'There's going to be no fun, I tell you,' said Shagrat. 'And he's got 
to be kept safe, or we're all as good as dead.' 

'All right! But if I were you, I’d catch the big one that's loose, 
before you send in any report to Lugb®rz. It won't sound too pretty to say 
you've caught the kitten and let the cat escape.' 

The voices began to move away. Sam heard the sound of feet receding. He 
was recovering from his shock, and now a wild fury was on him. 'I got it all 
wrong! ’ he cried. 'I knew I would. Now they've got him, the devils! the 
filth! Never leave your master, never, never: that was my right rule. And I 
knew it in my heart. May I be forgiven! Now I've got to get back to him. 
Somehow, somehow! ' 

He drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt, but it 
only gave out a dull sound. The sword, however, blazed so brightly now that 
he could see dimly in its light. To his surprise he noticed that the great 
block was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than twice his own height. 
Above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the 
opening. It was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of 
Shelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of 
her cunning. With his remaining strength Sam leaped and caught the top, 
scrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, 
round a bend and up a winding tunnel. 

The news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort 
beyond thought of weariness. He could not see anything ahead, for this new 
passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was catching the 




two Ores up: their voices were growing nearer again. Now they seemed quite 
close. 

'That's what I'm going to do,' said Shagrat in angry tones. 'Put him 
right up in the top chamber.' 

'What for? ' growled Gorbag. 'Haven't you any lock-ups down below? ' 

'He's going out of harm's way, I tell you,' answered Shagrat. 'See? 

He's precious. I don't trust all my lads, and none of yours; nor you 
neither, when you're mad for fun. He's going where I want him, and where you 
won't come, if you don't keep civil. Up to the top, I say. He'll be safe 
there.' 

'Will he?’ said Sam. 'You're forgetting the great big elvish warrior 
that's loose!' And with that he raced round the last corner, only to find 
that by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the Ring gave him, 
he had misjudged the distance. 

The two ore-figures were still some way ahead. He could see them now, 
black and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at last, up an 
incline; and at the end, wide open, were great double doors, leading 
probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower. Already the 
Ores with their burden had passed inside. Gorbag and Shagrat were drawing 
near the gate. 

Sam heard a burst of hoarse singing, blaring of horns and banging of 
gongs, a hideous clamour. Gorbag and Shagrat were already on the threshold. 

Sam yelled and brandished Sting, but his little voice was drowned in 
the tumult. No one heeded him. 

The great doors slammed to. Boom. The bars of iron fell into place 
inside. Clang. The gate was shut. Sam hurled himself against the bolted 
brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. He was out in the darkness. 
Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy. 




Here ends the second part of the history of the War of the Ring.

OF THE KING

* BOOK V * 



Chapter 1 . Minas Tirith 



Pippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf s cloak. He wondered if 
he was awake or still sleeping, still in the swift -moving dream in which he 
had been wrapped so long since the great ride began. The dark world was 
rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. He could see nothing but 
the wheeling stars, and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where 
the mountains of the South marched past. Sleepily he tried to reckon the 
times and stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy and uncertain. 

There had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt, and 
then in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had come to the 
silent town and the great empty house on the hill. And hardly had they 
reached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over once again, and 
men wilted with fear. But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and he had 
slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and 
of men talking and Gandalf giving orders. And then again riding, riding in 
the night. This was the second, no, the third night since he had looked in 
the Stone. And with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered, and the 
noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices. 

A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers 
Pippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful 
country Gandalf was bearing him. He rubbed his eyes, and then he saw that it 
was the moon rising above the eastern shadows, now almost at the full. So 
the night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on. He 
stirred and spoke. 

’Where are we, Gandalf?' he asked. 

'In the realm of Gondor,' the wizard answered. 'The land of Anurien is 
still passing by.' 

There was a silence again for a while. Then, 'What is that?' cried 
Pippin suddenly, clutching at Gandalf s cloak. 'Look! Fire, red fire! Are 
there dragons in this land? Look, there is another!' 

For answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. 'On, Shadowfax! We must 




hasten. Time is short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight, calling for 
aid. War is kindled. See, there is the fire on Amon Don, and flame on 
Eilenach; and there they go speeding west: Nardol, Erelas, Min-Rimmon, 
Calenhad, and the Elalifirien on the borders of Rohan.' 

But Shadowfax paused in his stride, slowing to a walk, and then he 
lifted up his head and neighed. And out of the darkness the answering neigh 
of other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard, and 
three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished 
into the West. Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away, 
and 

the night flowed over him like a roaring wind. 

Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling 
him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built 
on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and 
maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness 
to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or to B elf alas in the 
South. 'It is long since the beacons of the North were lit,' he said; 'and 
in the ancient days of Gondor they were not needed, for they had the Seven 
Stones.' Pippin stirred uneasily. 

'Sleep again, and do not be afraid!' said Gandalf. 'For you are not 
going like Frodo to Mordor, but to Minas Tirith, and there you will be as 
safe as you can be anywhere in these days. If Gondor falls, or the Ring is 
taken, then the Shire will be no refuge.' 

'You do not comfort me,' said Pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over 
him. The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a 
glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds 
as they caught the light of the westering moon. He wondered where Frodo was, 
and if he was already in Mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that 
Frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the 
coming of the day. 

Pippin woke to the sound of voices. Another day of hiding and a night 
of journey had fleeted by. It was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again, 
and chill grey mists were about them. Shadowfax stood steaming with sweat, 
but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness. Many tall men 
heavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall 
of stone. Partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the night was passed 
the sound of hurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of 




trowels, and the creak of wheels. Torches and flares glowed dully here and 
there in the fog. Gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way, and 
as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed. 

'Yea truly, we know you, Mithrandir,' said the leader of the men, 'and 
you know the pass-words of the Seven Gates and are free to go forward. But 
we do not know your companion. What is he? A dwarf out of the mountains 
in 

the North? We wish for no strangers in the land at this time, unless they be 
mighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust.' 

'I will vouch for him before the seat of Denethor,' said Gandalf. 'And 
as for valour, that cannot be computed by stature. He has passed through 
more battles and perils than you have, Ingold, though you be twice his 
height; and he comes now from the storming of Isengard, of which we bear 
tidings, and great weariness is on him, or I would wake him. His name is 
Peregrin, a very valiant man.' 

'Man?' said Ingold dubiously; and the others laughed. 

'Man!' cried Pippin, now thoroughly roused. 'Man! Indeed not! I am a 
hobbit and no more valiant than I am a man, save perhaps now and again by 
necessity. Do not let Gandalf deceive you!' 

'Many a doer of great deeds might say no more,' said Ingold. 'But what 
is a hobbit?' 

'A Halfling,' answered Gandalf. 'Nay, not the one that was spoken of,' 
he added seeing the wonder in the men's faces. 'Not he, yet one of his 
kindred.' 

'Yes, and one who journeyed with him,' said Pippin. 'And Boromir of 
your City was with us, and he saved me in the snows of the North, and at the 
last he was slain defending me from many foes.' 

'Peace!' said Gandalf. 'The news of that grief should have been told 
first to the father.' 

'It has been guessed already,' said Ingold; 'for there have been 
strange portents here of late. But pass on now quickly! For the Lord of 
Minas Tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his 
son, be he man or—' 

'Hobbit,' said Pippin. 'Little service can I offer to your lord, but 
what I can do, I would do, remembering Boromir the brave.' 

'Fare you well!' said Ingold; and the men made way for Shadow fax, and 
he passed through a narrow gate in the wall. 'May you bring good counsel to 




Denethor in his need, and to us all, Mithrandir!' Ingold cried. 'But you 
come with tidings of grief and danger, as is your wont, they say.' 

’Because I come seldom but when my help is needed,’ answered Gandalf. 
’And as for counsel, to you I would say that you are over-late in repairing 
the wall of the Pelennor. Courage will now be your best defence against the 
storm that is at hand - that and such hope as I bring. For not all the 
tidings that I bring are evil. But leave your trowels and sharpen your 
swords!’ 

’The work will be finished ere evening,’ said Ingold. ’This is the last 
portion of the wall to be put in defence: the least open to attack, for it 
looks towards our friends of Rohan. Do you know aught of them? Will they 
answer the summons, think you?’ 

'Yes, they will come. But they have fought many battles at your back. 

This road and no road looks towards safety any longer. Be vigilant! But for 
Gandalf Stormcrow you would have seen a host of foes coming out of 
Anurien 

and no Riders of Rohan. And you may yet. Fare you well, and sleep not!’ 

Gandalf passed now into the wide land beyond the Rammas Echor. So the 
men of Gondor called the out wall that they had built with great labour, 
after Ithilien fell under the shadow of their Enemy. For ten leagues or more 
it ran from the mountains' feet and so back again, enclosing in its fence 
the fields of the Pelennor: fair and fertile townlands on the long slopes 
and terraces falling to the deep levels of the Anduin. At its furthest point 
from the Great Gate of the City, north-eastward, the wall was four leagues 
distant, and there from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside 
the river, and men had made it high and strong; for at that point, upon a 
walled causeway, the road came in from the fords and bridges of Osgiliath 
and passed through a guarded gate between embattled towers. At its nearest 
point the wall was little more than one league from the City, and that was 
south-eastward. There Anduin, going in a wide knee about the hills of Emyn 
Arnen in South Ithilien, bent sharply west, and the out- wall rose upon its 
very brink; and beneath it lay the quays and landings of the Harlond for 
craft that came upstream from the southern fiefs. 

The townlands were rich, with wide tilth and many orchards, and 
homesteads there were with oast and garner, fold and byre, and many rills 
rippling through the green from the highlands down to Anduin. Yet the 




herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many, and the most part 
of 

the people of Gondor lived in the seven circles of the City, or in the high 
vales of the mountain-borders, in Lossarnach, or further south in fair 
Lebennin with its five swift streams. There dwelt a hardy folk between the 
mountains and the sea. They were reckoned men of Gondor, yet their blood 
was 

mingled, and there were short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came 
more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the 
Dark Years ere the coming of the kings. But beyond, in the great fief of 
B elf alas, dwelt Prince Imrahil in his castle of Dol Amroth by the sea, and 
he was of high blood, and his folk also, tall men and proud with sea-grey 
eyes. 

Now after Gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the 
sky, and Pippin roused himself and looked up. To his left lay a sea of mist, 
rising to a bleak shadow in the East; but to his right great mountains 
reared their heads, ranging from the West to a steep and sudden end, as if 
in the making of the land the River had burst through a great barrier, 
carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to 
come. And there where the White Mountains of Ered Nimrais came to their 
end 

he saw, as Gandalf had promised, the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, the deep 
purple shadows of its high glens, and its tall face whitening in the rising 
day. And upon its out-thrust knee was the Guarded City, with its seven walls 
of stone so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but 
carven by giants out of the bones of the earth. 

Even as Pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to 
white, blushing faintly in the dawn; and suddenly the sun climbed over the 
eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the City. Then 
Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high within the 
topmost walls' shone out against the sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl 
and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it 
were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the 
battlements in the morning breeze' and high and far he heard a clear ringing 
as of silver trumpets. 

So Gandalf and Peregrin rode to the Great Gate of the Men of Gondor at 
the rising of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them. 




'Mithrandir! Mithrandir!’ men cried. 'Now we know that the storm is 
indeed nigh!' 

'It is upon you,' said Gandalf. 'I have ridden on its wings. Let me 
pass! I must come to your Lord Denethor, while his stewardship lasts. 
Whatever betide, you have come to the end of the Gondor that you have 
known. 

Let me pass!' 

Then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him 
no further, though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him 
and at the horse that bore him. For the people of the City used horses very 
little and they were seldom seen in their streets, save only those ridden by 
the errand -riders of their lord. And they said: 'Surely that is one of the 
great steeds of the King of Rohan? Maybe the Rohirrim will come soon to 
strengthen us.' But Shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road. 

For the fashion of Minas Tirith was such that it was built on seven 
levels, each delved into the hill, and about each was set a wall, and in 
each wall was a gate. But the gates were not set in a line: the Great Gate 
in the City Wall was at the east point of the circuit, but the next faced 
half south, and the third half north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the 
paved way that climbed towards the Citadel turned first this way and then 
that across the face of the hill. And each time that it passed the line of 
the Great Gate it went through an arched tunnel, piercing a vast pier of 
rock whose huge out-thrust bulk divided in two all the circles of the City 
save the first. For partly in the primeval shaping of the hill, partly by 
the mighty craft and labour of old, there stood up from the rear of the wide 
court behind the Gate a towering bastion of stone, its edge sharp as a 
ship-keel facing east. Up it rose, even to the level of the topmost circle, 
and there was crowned by a battlement; so that those in the Citadel might, 
like mariners in a mountainous ship, look from its peak sheer down upon the 
Gate seven hundred feet below. The entrance to the Citadel also looked 
eastward, but was delved in the heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit 
slope ran up to the seventh gate. Thus men reached at last the High Court, 
and the Place of the Fountain before the feet of the White Tower: tall and 
shapely, fifty fathoms from its base to the pinnacle, where the banner of 
the Stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain. 

A strong citadel it was indeed, and not to be taken by a host of 
enemies, if there were any within that could hold weapons; unless some foe 




could come behind and scale the lower skirts of Mindolluin, and so come upon 
the narrow shoulder that joined the Hill of Guard to the mountain mass. But 
that shoulder, which rose to the height of the fifth wall, was hedged with 
great ramparts right up to the precipice that overhung its western end; and 
in that space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords, 
for ever silent between the mountain and the tower. 

Pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and more 
splendid than anything that he had dreamed of; greater and stronger than 
Isengard, and far more beautiful. Yet it was in truth falling year by year 
into decay; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease 
there. In every street they passed some great house or court over whose 
doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient 
shapes: names Pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt 
there; and yet now they were silent, and no footsteps rang on their wide 
pavements, nor voice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out from 
door or empty window. 

At last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate, and the warm sun 
that shone down beyond the river, as Frodo walked in the glades of Ithilien, 
glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and the great arch with 
keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head. Gandalf 
dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the Citadel, and Shadowfax suffered 
himself to be led away at the soft word of his master. 

The Guards of the gate were robed in black, and their helms were of 
strange shape, high-crowned, with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the 
face, and above the cheek-guards were set the white wings of sea-birds; but 
the helms gleamed with a flame of silver, for they were indeed wrought of 
mithril, heirlooms from the glory of old days. Upon the black surcoats were 
embroidered in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and 
many -pointed stars. This was the livery of the heirs of Elendil, and none 
wore it now in all Gondor, save the Guards of the Citadel before the Court 
of the Fountain where the White Tree once had grown. 

Already it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them: and 
at once they were admitted, silently, and without question. Quickly Gandalf 
strode across the white-paved court. A sweet fountain played there in the 
morning sun, and a sward of bright green lay about it; but in the midst, 
drooping over the pool, stood a dead tree, and the falling drops dripped 
sadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water. 




Pippin glanced at it as he hurried after Gandalf. It looked mournful, 
he thought, and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where 
everything else was well tended. 

Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree. 

The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind. And then 
he found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; 
and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the 
cool echoing shadows of the house of stone. 

They walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went 
Gandalf spoke softly to Pippin. 'Be careful of your words, Master Peregrin! 
This is no time for hobbit pertness. Thjoden is a kindly old man. Denethor 
is of another sort, proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and 
power, though he is not called a king. But he will speak most to you, and 
question you much, since you can tell him of his son Boromir. He loved him 
greatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. But 
under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches 
from you rather than from me. Do not tell him more than you need, and leave 
quiet the matter of Frodo's errand. I will deal with that in due time. And 
say nothing about Aragorn either, unless you must.' 

'Why not? What is wrong with Strider?' Pippin whispered. 'He meant to 
come here, didn't he? And he'll be arriving soon himself anyway.' 

'Maybe, maybe,' said Gandalf. 'Though if he comes, it is likely to be 
in some way that no one expects, not even Denethor. It will be better so. At 
least he should come unheralded by us.' 

Gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal. 'See, Master 
Pippin, there is no time to instruct you now in the history of Gondor; 
though it might have been better, if you had learned something of it, when 
you were still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the Shire. 

Do as I bid! It is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his 
heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who will, if 
he comes, claim the kingship. Is that enough?' 

'Kingship?' said Pippin amazed. 

'Yes,' said Gandalf. 'If you have walked all these days with closed 
ears and mind asleep, wake up now!' He knocked on the door. 

The door opened, but no one could be seen to open it. Pippin looked 
into a great hall. It was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at either 
side, beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof. Monoliths of 




black marble, they rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of 
beasts and leaves; and far above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with 
dull gold, inset with flowing traceries of many colours. No hangings nor 
storied webs, nor any things of woven stuff or of wood, were to be seen in 
that long solemn hall; but between the pillars there stood a silent company 
of tall images graven in cold stone. 

Suddenly Pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of Argonath, and awe 
fell on him, as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead. At the far 
end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble 
shaped like a crowned helm; behind it was carved upon the wall and set with 
gems an image of a tree in flower. But the throne was empty. At the foot of 
the dais, upon the lowest step which was broad and deep, there was a stone 
chair, black and unadorned, and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap. In 
his hand was a white rod with a golden knob. He did not look up. Solemnly 
they paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces from his 
footstool. Then Gandalf spoke. 

'Hail, Lord and Steward of Minas Tirith, Denethor son of Ecthelion! I 
am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.' 

Then the old man looked up. Pippin saw his carven face with its proud 
bones and skin like ivory, and the long curved nose between the dark deep 
eyes; and he was reminded not so much of Boromir as of Aragorn. 'Dark 
indeed 

is the hour,' said the old man, 'and at such times you are wont to come, 
Mithrandir. But though all the signs forebode that the doom of Gondor is 
drawing nigh, less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness. It has 
been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die. Is this he?' 

'It is,' said Gandalf. 'One of the twain. The other is with Thjoden of 
Rohan and may come hereafter. Halflings they are, as you see, yet this is 
not he of whom the omens spoke.' 

'Yet a Halfling still,' said Denethor grimly, 'and little love do I 
bear the name, since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and 
drew away my son on the wild errand to his death. My Boromir! Now we 
have 

need of you. Faramir should have gone in his stead.' 

'He would have gone,' said Gandalf. 'Be not unjust in your grief! 
Boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. He was 
a masterful man, and one to take what he desired. I journeyed far with him 




and learned much of his mood. But you speak of his death. You have had news 
of that ere we came?' 

'I have received this,' said Denethor, and laying down his rod he 
lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. In each hand he 
held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn 
bound with silver. 

That is the horn that Boromir always wore!' cried Pippin. 

'Verily,' said Denethor. 'And in my turn I bore it, and so did each 
eldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing 
of the kings, since Vorondil father of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw 
in the far fields of Rhyn. I heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches 
thirteen days ago, and the River brought it to me, broken: it will wind no 
more.' He paused and there was a heavy silence. Suddenly he turned his black 
glance upon Pippin. 'What say you to that, Halfling?' 

'Thirteen, thirteen days,' faltered Pippin. 'Yes, I think that would be 
so. Yes, I stood beside him, as he blew the horn. But no help came. Only 
more ores.' 

'So,' said Denethor, looking keenly at Pippin's face. 'You were there? 

Tell me more! Why did no help come? And how did you escape, and yet he 
did 

not, so mighty a man as he was, and only ores to withstand him?' 

Pippin flushed and forgot his fear. 'The mightiest man may be slain by 
one arrow,' he said; 'and Boromir was pierced by many. When last I saw him 
he sank beside a tree and plucked a black -feathered shaft from his side. 

Then I swooned and was made captive. I saw him no more, and know no 
more. 

But I honour his memory, for he was very valiant. He died to save us, my 
kinsman Meriadoc and myself, waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the 
Dark Lord; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the less.' 

Then Pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred strangely 
within him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. 

'Little service, no doubt, will so great a lord of Men think to find in a 
hobbit, a halfling from the northern Shire; yet such as it is, I will offer 
it, in payment of my debt.' Twitching aside his grey cloak, Pippin drew 
forth his small sword and laid it at Denethor's feet. 

A pale smile, like a gleam of cold sun on a winter's evening, passed 
over the old man's face; but he bent his head and held out his hand, laying 




the shards of the horn aside. ’Give me the weapon!' he said. 

Pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him. 'Whence came this?' 
said Denethor. 'Many, many years lie on it. Surely this is a blade wrought 
by our own kindred in the North in the deep past?' 

'It came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country ' said 
Pippin. 'But only evil wights dwell there now, and I will not willingly tell 
more of them.' 

'I see that strange tales are woven about you,' said Denethor, 'and 
once again it is shown that looks may belie the man - or the halfling. I 
accept your service. For you are not daunted by words; and you have 
courteous speech, strange though the sound of it may be to us in the South. 
And we shall have need of all folk of courtesy, be they great or small, in 
the days to come. Swear to me now!' 

'Take the hilt,' said Gandalf, 'and speak after the Lord, if you are 
resolved on this.' 

'I am,' said Pippin. 

The old man laid the sword along his lap, and Pippin put his hand to 
the hilt, and said slowly after Denethor: 

'Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, and to the Lord and 
Steward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to 
come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from 
this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the 
world end. So say I, Peregrin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.' 

And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord of Gondor, Steward 
of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is 
given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath- breaking with vengeance.' 
Then Pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath. 

'And now,' said Denethor, 'my first command to you: speak and be not 
silent! Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that you can of 
Boromir, my son. Sit now and begin!' As he spoke he struck a small silver 
gong that stood near his footstool, and at once servants came forward. 
Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the 
door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered. 

'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,' said Denethor, 'and see 
that none trouble us for one hour.' 

'It is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,' he 
said to Gandalf. 'Much of more import, it may seem, and yet to me less 




pressing. But maybe we can speak again at the end of the day.’ 

'And earlier, it is to be hoped,' said Gandalf. 'For I have not ridden 
hither from Isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind, 
only to bring you one small warrior, however courteous. Is it naught to you 
that Thjoden has fought a great battle and that Isengard is overthrown, and 
that I have broken the staff of Saruman?' 

'It is much to me. But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my 
own counsel against the menace of the East.' He turned his dark eyes on 
Gandalf, and now Pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the 
strain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn 
from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame. 

Denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, 
more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet by a sense other than 
sight Pippin perceived that Gandalf had the greater power and the deeper 
wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled. And he was older, far older. 'How 
much older?' he wondered, and then he thought how odd it was that he had 
never thought about it before. Treebeard had said something about wizards, 
but even then he had not thought of Gandalf as one of them. What was 
Gandalf? In what far time and place did he come into the world, and when 
would he leave it? And then his musings broke off, and he saw that Denethor 
and Gandalf still looked each other in the eye, as if reading the other's 
mind. But it was Denethor who first withdrew his gaze. 

'Yea,' he said; 'for though the Stones be lost, they say, still the 
lords of Gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come 
to 

them. But sit now!' 

Then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver 
with a silver flagon and cups, and white cakes. Pippin sat down, but he 
could not take his eyes from the old lord. Was it so, or had he only 
imagined it, that as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam of his eye had 
glanced upon Pippin's face? 

'Now tell me your tale, my liege,' said Denethor, half kindly; half 
mockingly. 'For the words of one whom my son so befriended will be 
welcome 
indeed.' 

Pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye 
of the Lord of Gondor, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and 




all the while conscious of Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and 
(so Pippin felt) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience. When the 
hour was over and Denethor again rang the gong, Pippin felt worn out. 'It 
cannot be more than nine o'clock,' he thought. 'I could now eat three 
breakfasts on end.' 

'Lead the Lord Mithrandir to the housing prepared for him,' said 
Denethor, 'and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will. 
But be it known that I have now sworn him to my service, and he shall be 
known as Peregrin son of Paladin and taught the lesser pass-words. Send word 
to the Captains that they shall wait on me here, as soon as may be after the 
third hour has rung. 

'And you, my Lord Mithrandir, shall come too, as and when you will. 
None shall hinder your coming to me at any time, save only in my brief hours 
of sleep. Let your wrath at an old man's folly run off and then return to my 
comfort!' 

'Folly?' said Gandalf. 'Nay, my lord, when you are a dotard you will 
die. You can use even your grief as a cloak. Do you think that I do not 
understand your purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the least, 
while I sit by?' 

'If you understand it, then be content,' returned Denethor. 'Pride 
would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need; but you deal out 
such gifts according to your own designs. Yet the Lord of Gondor is not to 
be made the tool of other men's purposes, however worthy. And to him there 
is no purpose higher in the world as it now stands than the good of Gondor; 
and the rule of Gondor, my lord, is mine and no other man's, unless the king 
should come again.' 

'Unless the king should come again?' said Gandalf. 'Well, my lord 
Steward, it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event, 
which few now look to see. In that task you shall have all the aid that you 
are pleased to ask for. But I will say this: the rule of no realm is mine, 
neither of Gondor nor any other, great or small. But all worthy things that 
are in peril as the world now stands, those are my care. And for my part, I 
shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything 
passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower 
again in days to come. For I also am a steward. Did you not know?' And with 
that he turned and strode from the hall with Pippin running at his side. 

Gandalf did not look at Pippin or speak a word to him as they went. 




Their guide brought them from the doors of the hall, and then led them 
across the Court of the Fountain into a lane between tall buildings of 
stone. After several turns they came to a house close to the wall of the 
citadel upon the north side, not far from the shoulder that linked the hill 
with the mountain. Within, upon the first floor above the street, up a wide 
carven stair, he showed them to a fair room, light and airy, with goodly 
hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured. It was sparely furnished, having but 
a small table, two chairs and a bench; but at either side there were 
curtained alcoves and well -clad beds within with vessels and basins for 
washing. There were three high narrow windows that looked northward over 
the 

great curve of Anduin, still shrouded in mists, towards the Emyn Muil and 
Rauros far away. Pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep 
stone sill. 

Are you angry with me, Gandalf?' he said, as their guide went out and 
closed the door. 'I did the best I could.’ 

'You did indeed!' said Gandalf, laughing suddenly; and he came and 
stood beside Pippin, putting his arm about the hobbit's shoulders and gazing 
out of the window. Pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close 
beside his own, for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry. Yet in 
the wizard's face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow; though as 
he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a 
fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth. 

'Indeed you did your best,' said the wizard; 'and I hope that it may be 
long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such 
terrible old men. Still the Lord of Gondor learned more from you than you 
may have guessed, Pippin. You could not hide the fact that Boromir did not 
lead the Company from Moria, and that there was one among you of high 
honour 

who was coming to Minas Tirith; and that he had a famous sword. Men think 
much about the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given long 
thought to the rhyme and to the words Isildur's Bane, since Boromir went 
away. 

'He is not as other men of this time, Pippin, and whatever be his 
descent from father to son, by some chance the blood of Westernesse runs 
nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, Faramir, and yet did not in 
Boromir whom he loved best. He has long sight. He can perceive, if he bends 




his will thither, much of what is passing in the minds of men, even of those 
that dwell far off. It is difficult to deceive him, and dangerous to try. 

'Remember that! For you are now sworn to his service. I do not know 
what put it into your head, or your heart, to do that. But it was well done. 

I did not hinder it, for generous deed should not be checked by cold 
counsel. It touched his heart, as well (may I say it) as pleasing his 
humour. And at least you are free now to move about as you will in Minas 
Tirith - when you are not on duty. For there is another side to it. You are 
at his command; and he will not forget. Be wary still!' 

He fell silent and sighed. 'Well, no need to brood on what tomorrow may 
bring. For one thing, tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today, 
for many days to come. And there is nothing more that I can do to help it. 

The board is set, and the pieces are moving. One piece that I greatly desire 
to find is Faramir, now the heir of Denethor. I do not think that he is in 
the City; but I have had no time to gather news. I must go. Pippin. I must 
go to this lords' council and learn what I can. But the Enemy has the move, 
and he is about to open his full game. And pawns are likely to see as much 
of it as any, Peregrin son of Paladin, soldier of Gondor. Sharpen your 
blade!' 

Gandalf went to the door, and there he turned. 'I am in haste Pippin,' 
he said. 'Do me a favour when you go out. Even before you rest, if you are 
not too weary. Go and find Shadowfax and see how he is housed. These 
people 

are kindly to beasts, for they are a good and wise folk, but they have less 
skill with horses than some.' 

With that Gandalf went out; and as he did so, there came the note of a 
clear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel. Three strokes it rang, 
like silver in the air, and ceased: the third hour from the rising of the 
sun. 

After a minute Pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked 
about the street. The sun was now shining warm and bright, and the towers 
and tall houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward. High in the blue air 
Mount Mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak. Armed men went to 
and fro in the ways of the City, as if going at the striking of the hour to 
changes of post and duty. 

'Nine o'clock we'd call it in the Shire,' said Pippin aloud to himself. 

'Just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring sunshine. 




And how I should like breakfast! Do these people ever have it, or is it 
over? And when do they have dinner, and where?' 

Presently he noticed a man, clad in black and white, coming along the 
narrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. Pippin felt lonely 
and made up his mind to speak as the man passed; but he had no need. The man 
came straight up to him. 

'You are Peregrin the Halfling?' he said. 'I am told that you have been 
sworn to the service of the Lord and of the City. Welcome! He held out his 
hand and Pippin took it. 

'I am named Beregond son of Baranor. I have no duty this morning, and I 
have been sent to you to teach you the pass-words, and to tell you some of 
the many things that no doubt you will wish to know. And for my part, I 
would learn of you also. For never before have we seen a halfling in this 
land and though we have heard rumour of them, little is said of them in any 
tale that we know. Moreover you are a friend of Mithrandir. Do you know him 
well?' 

'Well,' said Pippin. 'I have known of him all my short life, as you 
might say; and lately I have travelled far with him. But there is much to 
read in that book, and I cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two. 

Yet perhaps I know him as well as any but a few. Aragorn was the only one of 
our Company, I think, who really knew him.' 

'Aragorn?' said Beregond. 'Who is he?' 

'Oh,' stammered Pippin, 'he was a man who went about with us. I think 
he is in Rohan now.' 

'You have been in Rohan, I hear. There is much that I would ask you of 
that land also; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people. 

But I am forgetting my errand, which was first to answer what you would ask. 
What would you know, Master Peregrin?' 

'Er well,' said Pippin, 'if I may venture to say so, rather a burning 
question in my mind at present is, well, what about breakfast and all that? 

I mean, what are the meal-times, if you understand me, and where is the 
dining-room, if there is one? And the inns? I looked, but never a one could 
I see as we rode up, though I had been borne up by the hope of a draught of 
ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men.' 

Beregond looked at him gravely. 'An old campaigner, I see,' he said. 

'They say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food 
and of drink; though I am not a travelled man myself. Then you have not yet 




eaten today?' 

'Well, yes, to speak in courtesy, yes,' said Pippin. 'But no more than 
a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord; but he 
racked me for it with an hour of questions, and that is hungry work.' 

Beregond laughed. 'At the table small men may do the greater deeds, we 
say. But you have broken your fast as well as any man in the Citadel, and 
with greater honour. This is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in 
posture of war. We rise ere the Sun, and take a morsel in the grey light, 
and go to our duties at the opening hour. But do not despair!' He laughed 
again, seeing the dismay in Pippin's face. 'Those who have had heavy duty 
take somewhat to refresh their strength in the mid-morning. Then there is 
the nuncheon, at noon or after as duties allow; and men gather for the 
daymeal, and such mirth as there still may be, about the hour of sunset. 

'Come! We will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment, and 
eat and drink on the battlement, and survey the fair morning.' 

'One moment!' said Pippin blushing. 'Greed, or hunger by your courtesy, 
put it out of my mind. But Gandalf, Mithrandir as you call him, asked me to 
see to his horse - Shadowfax, a great steed of Rohan, and the apple of the 
king's eye, I am told, though he has given him to Mithrandir for his 
services. I think his new master loves the beast better than he loves many 
men, and if his good will is of any value to this city, you will treat 
Shadowfax with all honour: with greater kindness than you have treated this 
hobbit, if it is possible.' 

'Hobbit?' said Beregond. 

'That is what we call ourselves,' said Pippin. 

'I am glad to learn it,' said Beregond, 'for now I may say that strange 
accents do not mar fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. But 
come! You shall make me acquainted with this good horse. I love beasts, and 
we see them seldom in this stony city; for my people came from the 
mountain-vales, and before that from Ithilien. But fear not! The visit shall 
be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butteries.' 

Pippin found that Shadowfax had been well housed and tended. For in the 
sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables 
where a few swift horses were kept, hard by the lodgings of the 
errand-riders of the Lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent 
command of Denethor or his chief captains. But now all the horses and the 
riders were out and away. 




Shadowfax whinnied as Pippin entered the stable and turned his head. 
’Good morning!' said Pippin. ’Gandalf will come as soon as he may. He is 
busy, but he sends greetings, and I am to see that all is well with you; and 
you resting, I hope, after your long labours.' 

Shadowfax tossed his head and stamped. But he allowed Beregond to 
handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks. 

'He looks as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a 
great journey,' said Beregond. 'How strong and proud he is! Where is his 
harness? It should be rich and fair.' 

'None is rich and fair enough for him,' said Pippin. 'He will have 
none. If he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no 
bit, bridle, whip, or thong will tame him. Farewell, Shadowfax! Have 
patience. Battle is coming.' 

Shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and 
they covered their ears. Then they took their leave, seeing that the manger 
was well filled. 

'And now for our manger,' said Beregond, and he led Pippin back to the 
citadel, and so to a door in the north side of the great tower. There they 
went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps. There were 
hatches in the walls at the side, and one of these was open. 

'This is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the Guard.' said 
Beregond. 'Greetings, Targon!' he called through the hatch. 'It is early 
yet, but here is a newcomer that the Lord has taken into his service. He has 
ridden long and far with a tight belt, and has had sore labour this morning, 
and he is hungry. Give us what you have!' 

They got there bread, and butter, and cheese and apples: the last of 
the winter store, wrinkled but sound and sweet; and a leather flagon of 
new-drawn ale, and wooden platters and cups. They put all into a wicker 
basket and climbed back into the sun; and Beregond brought Pippin to a place 
at the east end of the great out-thrust battlement where there was an 
embrasure in the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill. From there they 
could look out on the morning over the world. 

They ate and drank; and they talked now of Gondor and its ways and 
customs, now of the Shire and the strange countries that Pippin had seen. 

And ever as they talked Beregond was more amazed, and looked with greater 
wonder at the hobbit, swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat, or 
standing tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below. 




'I will not hide from you, Master Peregrin,' said Beregond, 'that to us 
you look almost as one of our children, a lad of nine summers or so; and yet 
you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of our greybeards could 
boast of. I thought it was the whim of our Lord to take him a noble page, 
after the manner of the kings of old, they say. But I see that it is not so, 
and you must pardon my foolishness.' 

'I do,' said Pippin. 'Though you are not far wrong. I am still little 
more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people, and it will be four years 
yet before I "come of age", as we say in the Shire: But do not bother about 
me. Come and look and tell me what I can see.' 

The sun was now climbing, and the mists in the vale below had been 
drawn up. The last of them were floating away, just overhead, as wisps of 
white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from the East, that was now 
flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the citadel. Away down 
in the valley-bottom, five leagues or so as the eye leaps, the Great River 
could now be seen grey and glittering, coming out of the north-west, and 
bending in a mighty sweep south and west again, till it was lost to view in 
a haze and shimmer, far beyond which lay the Sea fifty leagues away. 

Pippin could see all the Pelennor laid out before him, dotted into the 
distance with farmsteads and little walls, barns and byres, but nowhere 
could he see any kine or other beasts. Many roads and tracks crossed the 
green fields, and there was much coming and going: wains moving in lines 
towards the Great Gate, and others passing out. Now and again a horseman 
would ride up, and leap from the saddle and hasten into the City. But most 
of the traffic went out along the chief highway, and that turned south, and 
then bending swifter than the River skirted the hills and passed soon from 
sight. It was wide and well -paved, and along its eastern edge ran a broad 
green riding -track, and beyond that a wall. On the ride horsemen galloped to 
and fro, but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains 
going south. But soon Pippin saw that all was in fact well-ordered: the 
wains were moving in three lines, one swifter drawn by horses; another 
slower, great waggons with fair housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and 
along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men. 

'That is the road to the vales of Tumladen and Lossarnach, and the 
mountain-villages, and then on to Lebennin,' said Beregond. 'There go the 
last of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children, and the 
women that must go with them. They must all be gone from the Gate and the 




road clear for a league before noon: that was the order. It is a sad 
necessity.' He sighed. ’Few, maybe, of those now sundered will meet again. 
And there were always too few children in this city; but now there are 
none-save some young lads that will not depart, and may find some task to 
do: my own son is one of them.' 

They fell silent for a while. Pippin gazed anxiously eastward, as if at 
any moment he might see thousands of ores pouring over the fields. 'What can 
I see there?' he asked, pointing down to the middle of the great curve of 
the Anduin. 'Is that another city, or what is it?' 

'It was a city,' said Beregond, 'the chief city of Gondor, of which 
this was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of Osgiliath on either side 
of Anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. Yet we won it back in 
the days of the youth of Denethor: not to dwell in, but to hold as an 
outpost, and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms. And then 
came the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.' 

'The Black Riders?' said Pippin, opening his eyes, and they were wide 
and dark with an old fear re-awakened. 

'Yes, they were black,' said Beregond, 'and I see that you know 
something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.' 

'I know of them,' said Pippin softly, 'but I will not speak of them 
now, so near, so near.' He broke off and lifted his eyes above the River, 
and it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening 
shadow. Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged 
edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a 
cloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom. But even as he looked 
it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly, 
slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun. 

'So near to Mordor?' said Beregond quietly. 'Yes, there it lies. We 
seldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow: sometimes it 
seems fainter and more distant; sometimes nearer and darker. It is growing 
and darkening now; and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too. And the 
Fell Riders, less than a year ago they won back the crossings, and many of 
our best men were slain. Boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back 
from this western shore, and we hold still the near half of Osgiliath. For a 
little while. But we await now a new onslaught there. Maybe the chief 
onslaught of the war that comes.' 

'When?' said Pippin. 'Have you a guess? For I saw the beacons last 




night and the errand-riders; and Gandalf said that it was a sign that war 
had begun. He seemed in a desperate hurry. But now everything seems to have 
slowed up again.' 

'Only because everything is now ready,' said Beregond. 'It is but the 
deep breath before the plunge.' 

'But why were the beacons lit last night?' 

'It is over -late to send for aid when you are already besieged,' 
answered Beregond. 'But I do not know the counsel of the Lord and his 
captains. They have many ways of gathering news. And the Lord Denethor is 
unlike other men: he sees far. Some say that as he sits alone in his high 
chamber in the Tower at night, and bends his thought this way and that, he 
can read somewhat of the future; and that he will at times search even the 
mind of the Enemy, wrestling with him. And so it is that he is old, worn 
before his time. But however that may be, my lord Faramir is abroad, beyond 
the River on some perilous errand, and he may have sent tidings. 

'But if you would know what I think set the beacons ablaze, it was the 
news that came yestereve out of Lebennin. There is a great fleet drawing 
near to the mouths of Anduin, manned by the corsairs of Umbar in the South. 
They have long ceased to fear the might of Gondor, and they have allied them 
with the Enemy, and now make a heavy stroke in his cause. For this attack 
will draw off much of the help that we looked to have from Lebennin and 
Belfalas, where folk are hardy and numerous. All the more do our thoughts go 
north to Rohan; and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that 
you bring. 

'And yet' - he paused and stood up, and looked round, north, east, and 
south - 'the doings at Isengard should warn us that we are caught now in a 
great net and strategy. This is no longer a bickering at the fords, raiding 
from Ithilien and from Anurien, ambushing and pillaging. This is a great war 
long -planned, and we are but one piece in it, whatever pride may say. Things 
move in the far East beyond the Inland Sea, it is reported; and north in 
Mirkwood and beyond; and south in Harad. And now all realms shall be put to 
the test, to stand, or fall - under the Shadow. 

'Yet, Master Peregrin, we have this honour: ever we bear the brunt of 
the chief hatred of the Dark Lord, for that hatred comes down out of the 
depths of time and over the deeps of the Sea. Here will the hammer-stroke 
fall hardest. And for that reason Mithrandir came hither in such haste. For 
if we fall, who shall stand? And, Master Peregrin, do you see any hope that 




we shall stand?' 

Pippin did not answer. He looked at the great walls, and the towers and 
brave banners, and the sun in the high sky, and then at the gathering gloom 
in the East; and he thought of the long fingers of that Shadow: of the ores 
in the woods and the mountains, the treason of Isengard, the birds of evil 
eye, and the Black Riders even in the lanes of the Shire - and of the winged 
terror, the Nazgyl. He shuddered, and hope seemed to wither. And even at 
that moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured, as though a dark 
wing had passed across it. Almost beyond hearing he thought he caught, high 
and far up in the heavens, a cry: faint, but heart-quelling, cruel and cold. 

He blanched and cowered against the wall. 

’What was that?' asked Beregond. 'You also felt something?' 

'Yes,' muttered Pippin. 'It is the sign of our fall, and the shadow of 
doom, a Fell Rider of the air.' 

'Yes, the shadow of doom,' said Beregond. 'I fear that Minas Tirith 
shall fall. Night comes. The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.' 

For a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak. Then 
suddenly Pippin looked up and saw that the sun was still shining and the 
banners still streaming in the breeze. He shook himself. 'It is passed,' he 
said. 'No, my heart will not yet despair. Gandalf fell and has returned and 
is with us. We may stand, if only on one leg, or at least be left still upon 
our knees.' 

'Rightly said!' cried Beregond, rising and striding to and fro. 'Nay, 
though all things must come utterly to an end in time, Gondor shall not 
perish yet. Not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build 
a hill of carrion before them. There are still other fastnesses, and secret 
ways of escape into the mountains. Hope and memory shall live still in some 
hidden valley where the grass is green.' 

'All the same, I wish it was over for good or ill.' said Pippin. 'I am 
no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge 
of one that I can't escape is worst of all. What a long day it seems 
already ! I should be happier, if we were not obliged to stand and watch, 
making no move, striking nowhere first. No stroke would have been struck in 
Rohan, I think, but for Gandalf.' 

'Ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!' said 
Beregond. 'But things may change when Faramir returns. He is bold, more bold 
than many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can 




be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man 
of hardihood and swift judgement in the field. But such is Faramir. Less 
reckless and eager than Boromir, but not less resolute. Yet what indeed can 
he do? We cannot assault the mountains of - of yonder realm. Our reach is 
shortened, and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it. Then our hand 
must be heavy!' He smote the hilt of his sword. 

Pippin looked at him: tall and proud and noble, as all the men that he 
had yet seen in that land; and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of 
the battle. 'Alas! my own hand feels as light as a feather,' he thought, but 
he said nothing. 'A pawn did Gandalf say? Perhaps but on the wrong 
chessboard.' 

So they talked until the sun reached its height, and suddenly the 
noon-bells were rung, and there was a stir in the citadel; for all save the 
watchmen were going to their meal. 

'Will you come with me?' said Beregond. 'You may join my mess for this 
day. I do not know to what company you will be assigned; or the Lord may 
hold you at his own command. But you will be welcome. And it will be well to 
meet as many men as you may, while there is yet time.' 

'I shall be glad to come,' said Pippin. 'I am lonely, to tell you the 
truth. I left my best friend behind in Rohan, and I have had no one to talk 
to or jest with. Perhaps I could really join your company? Are you the 
captain? If so, you could take me on, or speak for me?' 

'Nay, nay,' Beregond laughed, 'I am no captain. Neither office nor rank 
nor lordship have I, being but a plain man of arms of the Third Company of 
the Citadel. Yet, Master Peregrin, to be only a man of arms of the Guard of 
the Tower of Gondor is held worthy in the City, and such men have honour in 
the land.' 

'Then it is far beyond me,' said Pippin. 'Take me back to our room, and 
if Gandalf is not there, I will go where you like - as your guest.' 

Gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so Pippin went 
with Beregond and was made known to the men of the Third Company. And 
it 

seemed that Beregond got as much honour from it as his guest, for Pippin was 
very welcome. There had already been much talk in the citadel about 
Mithrandir's companion and his long closeting with the Lord; and rumour 
declared that a Prince of the Halflings had come out of the North to offer 
allegiance to Gondor and five thousand swords. And some said that when the 




Riders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small 
maybe, but doughty. 

Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could 
not be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by 
Boromir and honoured by the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for 
coming 

among them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him 
as much food and ale as he could wish. Indeed his only trouble was to be 
’wary' according to the counsel of Gandalf, and not to let his tongue wag 
freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends. 

At length Beregond rose. 'Farewell for this time!' he said. 'I have 
duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, I think. But if you are 
lonely, as you say, maybe you would like a merry guide about the City. My 
son would go with you gladly. A good lad, I may say. If that pleases you, go 
down to the lowest circle and ask for the Old Guesthouse in the Rath 
Celerdain, the Lamp wrights' Street. You will find him there with other lads 
that are remaining in the City. There may be things worth seeing down at the 
Great Gate ere the closing.' 

He went out, and soon after all the others followed. The day was still 
fine, though it was growing hazy, and it was hot for March, even so far 
southwards. Pippin felt sleepy, but the lodging seemed cheerless, and he 
decided to go down and explore the City. He took a few morsels that he had 
saved to Shadowfax, and they were graciously accepted, though the horse 
seemed to have no lack. Then he walked on down many winding ways. 

People stared much as he passed. To his face men were gravely 
courteous, saluting him after the manner of Gondor with bowed head and hands 
upon the breast; but behind him he heard many calls, as those out of doors 
cried to others within to come and see the Prince of the Halflings, the 
companion of Mithrandir. Many used some other tongue than the Common 
Speech, 

but it was not long before he learned at least what was meant by Emil i 
Pheriannath and knew that his title had gone down before him into the City. 

He came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to 
the lowest and widest circle, and there he was directed to the Lampwrights' 
Street, a broad way running towards the Great Gate. In it he found the Old 
Guesthouse, a large building of grey weathered stone with two wings running 




back from the street, and between them a narrow greensward, behind which 
was 

the many-windowed house, fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch 
and a flight of steps down on to the grass. Boys were playing among the 
pillars, the only children that Pippin had seen in Minas Tirith, and he 
stopped to look at them. Presently one of them caught sight of him, and with 
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into the street, followed by 
several others. There he stood in front of Pippin, looking him up and down. 

'Greetings!' said the lad. 'Where do you come from? You are a stranger 
in the City.’ 

’I was,’ said Pippin; 'but they say I have become a man of Gondor.' 

'Oh come!' said the lad. 'Then we are all men here. But how old are 
you, and what is your name? I am ten years already, and shall soon be five 
feet. I am taller than you. But then my father is a Guard, one of the 
tallest. What is your father?' 

'Which question shall I answer first?' said Pippin. 'My father farms 
the lands round Whitwell near Tuckborough in the Shire. I am nearly 
twenty-nine, so I pass you there; though I am but four feet, and not likely 
to grow any more, save sideways.' 

'Twenty-nine!' said the lad and whistled. 'Why, you are quite old! As 
old as my uncle Iorlas. Still,' he added hopefully, 'I wager I could stand 
you on your head or lay you on your back.' 

'Maybe you could, if I let you,' said Pippin with a laugh. 'And maybe I 
could do the same to you: we know some wrestling tricks in my little 
country. Where, let me tell you, I am considered uncommonly large and 
strong; and I have never allowed anyone to stand me on my head. So if it 
came to a trial and nothing else would serve, I might have to kill you. For 
when you are older, you will learn that folk are not always what they seem; 
and though you may have taken me for a soft stranger -lad and easy prey, let 
me warn you: I am not, I amahalfling, hard, bold, and wicked!' Pippin 
pulled such a grim face that the boy stepped back a pace, but at once he 
returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye. 

'No!' Pippin laughed. 'Don't believe what strangers say of themselves 
either! I am not a fighter. But it would be politer in any case for the 
challenger to say who he is.' 

The boy drew himself up proudly. 'I am Bergil son of Beregond of the 
Guards,' he said. 




'So I thought,' said Pippin, 'for you look like your father. I know him 
and he sent me to find you.' 

'Then why did you not say so at once?' said Bergil, and suddenly a look 
of dismay came over his face. 'Do not tell me that he has changed his mind, 
and will send me away with the maidens! But no, the last wains have gone.' 

'His message is less bad than that, if not good.' said Pippin. 'He says 
that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head, you might show me 
round the City for a while and cheer my loneliness. I can tell you some 
tales of far countries in return.' 

Bergil clapped his hands, and laughed with relief. 'All is well,' he 
cried. 'Come then! We were soon going to the Gate to look on. We will go 
now.' 

'What is happening there?' 

'The Captains of the Outlands are expected up the South Road ere 
sundown. Come with us and you will see.' 

Bergil proved a good comrade, the best company Pippin had had since he 
parted from Merry, and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they 
went about the streets, heedless of the many glances that men gave them. 
Before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the Great Gate. 
There Pippin went up much in the esteem of Bergil, for when he spoke his 
name and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and 
what was more, he allowed him to take his companion with him. 

'That is good!' said Bergil. 'We boys are no longer allowed to pass the 
Gate without an elder. Now we shall see better.' 

Beyond the Gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road 
and of the great paved space into which all the ways to Minas Tirith ran. 

All eyes were turned southwards, and soon a murmur rose: 'There is dust away 
there! They are coming!' 

Pippin and Bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd, 
and waited. Horns sounded at some distance, and the noise of cheering rolled 
towards them like a gathering wind. Then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and 
all about them people were shouting. 

'Forlong! Forlong!' Pippin heard men calling. 'What do they say?' he 
asked. 

'Forlong has come,' Bergil answered; 'old Forlong the Fat, the Lord of 
Lossarnach. That is where my grandsire lives. Hurrah! Here he is. Good old 
Forlong!' 




Leading the line there came walking a big thick -limbed horse, and on it 
sat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth, but old and grey -bearded, yet 
mail-clad and black-helmed and bearing a long heavy spear. Behind him 
marched proudly a dusty line of men, well-armed and bearing great 
battle-axes; grim-faced they were, and shorter and somewhat swarthier than 
any men that Pippin had yet seen in Gondor. 

'Forlong!' men shouted. 'True heart, true friend! Forlong!' But when 
the men of Lossarnach had passed they muttered: ’So few! Two hundreds, 
what 

are they? We hoped for ten times the number. That will be the new tidings of 
the black fleet. They are sparing only a tithe of their strength. Still 
every little is a gain.' 

And so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed 
through the Gate, men of the Outlands marching to defend the City of Gondor 
in a dark hour; but always too few, always less than hope looked for or need 
asked. The men of Ringlu Vale behind the son of their lord, Dervorin 
striding on foot: three hundreds. From the uplands of Morthond, the great 
Blackroot Vale, tall Duinhir with his sons, Duilin and Derufin, and five 
hundred bowmen. From the Anfalas, the Langstrand far away, a long line of 
men of many sorts, hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages, scantily 
equipped save for the household of Golasgil their lord. From Lamedon, a few 
grim hillmen without a captain. Fisher-folk of the Ethir, some hundred or 
more spared from the ships. Hirluin the Fair of the Green Hills from Pinnath 
Gelin with three hundreds of gallant green-clad men. And last and proudest, 
Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, kinsman of the Lord, with gilded banners 
bearing his token of the Ship and the Silver Swan, and a company of knights 
in full harness riding grey horses; and behind them seven hundreds of men at 
arms, tall as lords, grey-eyed, dark-haired, singing as they came. 

And that was all, less than three thousands full told. No more would 
come. Their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the City and died 
away. The onlookers stood silent for a while. Dust hung in the air, for the 
wind had died and the evening was heavy. Already the closing hour was 
drawing nigh, and the red sun had gone behind Mindolluin. Shadow came 
down 

on the City. 

Pippin looked up, and it seemed to him that the sky had grown 
ashen-grey, as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them, and light came 




dully through it. But in the West the dying sun had set all the fume on 
fire, and now Mindolluin stood black against a burning smoulder flecked with 
embers. ’So ends a fair day in wrath!' he said forgetful of the lad at his 
side. 

’So it will, if I have not returned before the sundown-bells,' said 
Bergil. 'Come! There goes the trumpet for the closing of the Gate.' 

Hand in hand they went back into the City, the last to pass the Gate 
before it was shut; and as they reached the Lampwrights' Street all the 
bells in the towers tolled solemnly. Lights sprang in many windows, and from 
the houses and wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound 
of song. 

'Farewell for this time,' said Bergil. 'Take my greetings to my 
ifather, and thank him for the company that he sent. Come again soon, I beg. 
Almost I wish now that there was no war, for we might have had some merry 
times. We might have journeyed to Lossarnach, to my grandsire's house; it is 
good to be there in Spring, the woods and fields are full of flowers. But 
maybe we will go thither together yet. They will never overcome our Lord, 
and my father is very valiant. Farewell and return!' 

They parted and Pippin hurried back towards the citadel. It seemed a 
long way, and he grew hot and very hungry; and night closed down swift and 
dark. Not a star pricked the sky. He was late for the daymeal in the mess, 
and Beregond greeted him gladly, and sat him at his side to hear news of his 
son. After the meal Pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a 
strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf 
again. 

'Can you find your way?' said Beregond at the door of the small hall, 
on the north side of the citadel, where they had sat. 'It is a black night, 
and all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within 
the City, and none are to shine out from the walls. And I can give you news 
of another order: you will be summoned to the Lord Denethor early tomorrow. 
I fear you will not be for the Third Company. Still we may hope to meet 
again. Farewell and sleep in peace!' 

The lodging was dark, save for a little lantern set on the table. 

Gandalf was not there. Gloom settled still more heavily on Pippin. He 
climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a window, but it was like 
looking into a pool of ink. He got down and closed the shutter and went to 
bed. For a while he lay and listened for sounds of Gandalf s return, and 




then he fell into an uneasy sleep. 

In the night he was wakened by a light, and he saw that Gandalf had 
come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. 
There were candles on the table and rolls of parchment. He heard the wizard 
sigh, and mutter: 'When will Faramir return?' 

'Hullo!' said Pippin, poking his head round the curtain. 'I thought you 
had forgotten all about me. I am glad to see you back. It has been a long 
day.' 

'But the night will be too short,' said Gandalf. 'I have come back 
here, for I must have a little peace, alone. You should sleep, in a bed 
while you still may. At the sunrise I shall take you to the Lord Denethor 
again. No, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. The Darkness has begun. 
There will be no dawn.' 




Chapter 2. The Passing of the Grey Company 



Gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of Shadowfax were lost in the 
night, when Merry came back to Aragorn. He had only a light bundle, for he 
had lost his pack at Parth Galen, and all he had was a few useful things he 
had picked up among the wreckage of Isengard. Hasufel was already saddled. 
Legolas and Gimli with their horse stood close by. 

'So four of the Company still remain,' said Aragorn. 'We will ride on 
together. But we shall not go alone, as I thought. The king is now 
determined to set out at once. Since the coming of the winged shadow, he 
desires to return to the hills under cover of night.' 

'And then whither?' said Legolas. 

'I cannot say yet,' Aragorn answered. 'As for the king, he will go to 
the muster that he commanded at Edoras, four nights from now. And there, I 
think, he will hear tidings of war, and the Riders of Rohan will go down to 
Minas Tirith. But for myself, and any that will go with me . . .' 

'I for one!' cried Legolas. 'And Gimli with him!' said the Dwarf. 

'Well, for myself,' said Aragorn, 'it is dark before me. I must go down 
also to Minas Tirith, but I do not yet see the road. An hour long prepared 
approaches.' 

'Don't leave me behind!' said Merry. 'I have not been of much use yet; 
but I don't want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is 
over. I don't think the Riders will want to be bothered with me now. Though, 
of course, the king did say that I was to sit by him when he came to his 
house and tell him all about the Shire.' 

'Yes,' said Aragorn, 'and your road lies with him, I think, Merry. But 
do not look for mirth at the ending. It will be long, I fear, ere Thjoden 
sits at ease again in Meduseld. Many hopes will wither in this bitter 
Spring.' 

Soon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with Gimli behind 
Legolas, and Merry in front of Aragorn. Presently they were riding swiftly 
through the night. They had not long passed the mounds at the Fords of Isen, 
when a Rider galloped up from the rear of their line. 

'My lord,' he said to the king, 'there are horsemen behind us. As we 
crossed the fords I thought that I heard them. Now we are sure. They are 




overtaking us, riding hard.' 

Thjoden at once called a halt. The Riders turned about and seized their 
spears. Aragorn dismounted and set Merry on the ground, and drawing his 
sword he stood by the king’s stirrup. Jomer and his esquire rode back to the 
rear. Merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever, and he wondered, if 
there was a fight, what he should do. Supposing the king's small escort was 
trapped and overcome, but he escaped into the darkness - alone in the wild 
fields of Rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles? 'No 
good!' he thought. He drew his sword and tightened his belt. 

The sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but suddenly it 
rode out clear again. Then they all heard the sound of hoofs, and at the 
same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the fords. 
The moonlight glinted here and there on the points of spears. The number of 
the pursuers could not be told, but they seemed no fewer than the king's 
escort, at the least. 

When they were some fifty paces off, Jomer cried in a loud voice: 

'Halt! Halt! Who rides in Rohan?' 

The pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand. A silence 
followed: and then in the moonlight, a horseman could be seen dismounting 
and walking slowly forward. His hand showed white as he held it up, palm 
outward, in token of peace; but the king's men gripped their weapons. At ten 
paces the man stopped. He was tall, a dark standing shadow. Then his clear 
voice rang out. 

'Rohan? Rohan did you say? That is a glad word. We seek that land in 
haste from long afar.' 

'You have found it,' said Jomer. 'When you crossed the fords yonder you 
entered it. But it is the realm of Thjoden the King. None ride here save by 
his leave. Who are you? And what is your haste?' 

'Halbarad D®nadan, Ranger of the North I am,' cried the man. 'We seek 
one Aragorn son of Arathorn, and we heard that he was in Rohan.' 

'And you have found him also!' cried Aragorn. Giving his reins to 
Merry, he ran forward and embraced the newcomer. 'Halbarad!' he said. 'Of 
all joys this is the least expected!' 

Merry breathed a sigh of relief. He had thought that this was some last 
trick of Saruman's, to waylay the king while he had only a few men about 
him; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in Thjoden's defence, 
not yet at any rate. He sheathed his sword. 




'All is well,' said Aragorn, turning back. 'Here are some of my own kin 
from the far land where I dwelt. But why they come, and how many they be, 
Halbarad shall tell us.' 

'I have thirty with me,' said Halbarad. 'That is all of our kindred 
that could be gathered in haste; but the brethren Elladan and Elrohir have 
ridden with us, desiring to go to the war. We rode as swiftly as we might 
when your summons came.' 

'But I did not summon you,' said Aragorn, 'save only in wish. My 
thoughts have often turned to you, and seldom more than tonight; yet I have 
sent no word. But come! All such matters must wait. You find us riding in 
haste and danger. Ride with us now, if the king will give his leave.' 

Thjoden was indeed glad of the news. 'It is well!' he said. 'If these 
kinsmen be in any way like to yourself, my lord Aragorn, thirty such knights 
will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.' 

Then the Riders set out again, and Aragorn for a while rode with the 
D®nedain; and when they had spoken of tidings in the North and in the South, 
Elrohir said to him: 

'I bring word to you from my father: The days are short. If thou art in 
haste, remember the Paths of the Dead.' 

'Always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire,' 
answered Aragorn. 'But great indeed will be my haste ere I take that road.' 

'That will soon be seen,' said Elrohir. 'But let us speak no more of 
these things upon the open road!' 

And Aragorn said to Halbarad: 'What is that that you bear, kinsman?' 

For he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff, as it were a 
standard, but it was close-furled in a black cloth bound about with many 
thongs. 

'It is a gift that I bring you from the Lady of Rivendell,' answered 
Halbarad. 'She wrought it in secret, and long was the making. But she also 
sends word to you: The days now are short. Either our hope cometh, or all 
hopes end. Therefore I send thee what I have made for thee. Fare well, 
Elfstone!' 

And Aragorn said: 'Now I know what you bear. Bear it still for me a 
while!' And he turned and looked away to the North under the great stars, 
and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night's journey lasted. 

The night was old and the East grey when they rode up at last from 
Deeping-coomb and came back to the Hornburg. There they were to lie and rest 




for a brief while and take counsel. 

Merry slept until he was roused by Legolas and Gimli. The Sun is 
high,' said Legolas. 'All others are up and doing. Come, Master Sluggard, 
and look at this place while you may!' 

'There was a battle here three nights ago,' said Gimli, 'and here 
Legolas and I played a game that I won only by a single ore. Come and see 
how it was! And there are caves, Merry, caves of wonder! Shall we visit 
them, Legolas, do you think?' 

'Nay! There is no time,' said the Elf. 'Do not spoil the wonder with 
haste! I have given you my word to return hither with you, if a day of peace 
and freedom comes again. But it is now near to noon, and at that hour we 
eat, and then set out again, I hear.' 

Merry got up and yawned. His few hours' sleep had not been nearly 
enough; he was tired and rather dismal. He missed Pippin, and felt that he 
was only a burden, while everybody was making plans for speed in a business 
that he did not fully understand. 'Where is Aragorn?' he asked. 

'In a high chamber of the Burg,' said Legolas. 'He has neither rested 
nor slept, I think. He went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take 
thought, and only his kinsman, Halbarad, went with him; but some dark doubt 
or care sits on him.' 

'They are a strange company, these newcomers,' said Gimli. 'Stout men 
and lordly they are, and the Riders of Rohan look almost as boys beside 
them; for they are grim men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most 
part, even as Aragorn himself; and they are silent.' 

'But even as Aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence.' 
said Legolas. 'And have you marked the brethren Elladan and Elrohir? Less 
sombre is their gear than the others', and they are fair and gallant as 
Elven-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of Elrond of 
Rivendell.' 

'Why have they come? Have you heard?' asked Merry. He had now dressed, 
and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and the three passed out 
together towards the ruined gate of the Burg. 

'They answered a summons, as you heard,' said Gimli. 'Word came to 
Rivendell, they say: Aragorn has need of his kindred. Let the D®nedain ride 
to him in Rohan! But whence this message came they are now in doubt. 

Gandalf 

sent it, I would guess.' 




'Nay, Galadriel,' said Legolas. 'Did she not speak through Gandalf of 
the ride of the Grey Company from the North?' 

'Yes, you have it,' said Gimli. 'The Lady of the Wood! She read many 
hearts and desires. Now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk, 
Legolas?' 

Legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and 
east, and his fair face was troubled. 'I do not think that any would come,' 
he answered. 'They have no need to ride to war; war already marches on their 
own lands.' 

For a while the three companions walked together, speaking of this and 
that turn of the battle, and they went down from the broken gate, and passed 
the mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road, until they stood 
on Helm's Dike and looked into the Coomb. The Death Down already stood 
there, black and tall and stony, and the great trampling and scoring of the 
grass by the Huorns could be plainly seen. The Dunlendings and many men of 
the garrison of the Burg were at work on the Dike or in the fields and about 
the battered walls behind; yet all seemed strangely quiet: a weary valley 
resting after a great storm. Soon they turned back and went to the midday 
meal in the hall of the Burg. 

The king was already there, and as soon as they entered he called for 
Merry and had a seat set for him at his side. 'It is not as I would have 
it,' said Thjoden; 'for this is little like my fair house in Edoras. And 
your friend is gone, who should also be here. But it may be long ere we sit, 
you and I, at the high table in Meduseld; there will be no time for feasting 
when I return thither. But come now! Eat and drink, and let us speak 
together while we may. And then you shall ride with me.' 

'May I?' said Merry, surprised and delighted. 'That would be splendid!' 

He had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words. 'I am afraid I am 
only in everybody's way,' he stammered; 'but I should like to do anything I 
could, you know.' 

'I doubt it not,' said the king. 'I have had a good hill-pony made 
ready for you. He will bear you as swift as any horse by the roads that we 
shall take. For I will ride from the Burg by mountain paths, not by the 
plain, and so come to Edoras by way of Dunharrow where the Lady Jowyn 
awaits 

me. You shall be my esquire, if you will. Is there gear of war in this 
place, Jomer, that my sword-thain could use?' 




'There are no great weapon-hoards here, lord.' answered Jomer. 'Maybe a 
light helm might be found to fit him; but we have no mail or sword for one 
of his stature.' 

'I have a sword,' said Merry, climbing from his seat, and drawing from 
its black sheath his small bright blade. Filled suddenly with love for this 
old man, he knelt on one knee, and took his hand and kissed it. 'May I lay 
the sword of Meriadoc of the Shire on your lap Thjoden King?' he cried. 
'Receive my service, if you will!' 

'Gladly will I take it,' said the king; and laying his long old hands 
upon the brown hair of the hobbit; he blessed him. 'Rise now, Meriadoc, 
esquire of Rohan of the household of Meduseld!' he said. 'Take your sword 
and bear it unto good fortune!' 

'As a father you shall be to me,' said Merry. 

'For a little while,' said Thjoden. 

They talked then together as they ate, until presently Jomer spoke. 'It 
is near the hour that we set for our going, lord,' he said. 'Shall I bid men 
sound the horns? But where is Aragorn? His place is empty and he has not 
eaten.' 

'We will make ready to ride,' said Thjoden; 'but let word be sent to 
the Lord Aragorn that the hour is nigh.' 

The king with his guard and Merry at his side passed down from the gate 
of the Burg to where the Riders were assembling on the green. Many were 
already mounted. It would be a great company; for the king was leaving only 
a small garrison in the Burg, and all who could be spared were riding to the 
weapontake at Edoras. A thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at 
night; but still there would be some five hundred more to go with the king, 
for the most part men from the fields and dales of Westfold. 

A little apart the Rangers sat, silent, in an ordered company, armed 
with spear and bow and sword. They were clad in cloaks of dark grey, and 
their hoods were cast now over helm and head. Their horses were strong and 
of proud bearing, but rough-haired; and one stood there without a rider, 
Aragorn's own horse that they had brought from the North; Roheryn was his 
name. There was no gleam of stone or gold, nor any fair thing in all their 
gear and harness: nor did their riders bear any badge or token, save only 
that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver 
shaped like a rayed star. 

The king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside him on his 




pony: Stybba was his name. Presently Jomer came out from the gate, and with 
him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, 
and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of 
Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark -haired, grey-eyed, and their 
faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. 
Behind them walked Legolas and Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for 
Aragorn, 

so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many 
years had fallen on his head. Grim was his face, grey-hued and weary. 

'I am troubled in mind, lord,' he said, standing by the king's horse. 

'I have heard strange words, and I see new perils far off. I have laboured 
long in thought, and now I fear that I must change my purpose. Tell me, 
Thjoden, you ride now to Dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?' 

'It is now a full hour past noon,' said Jomer. 'Before the night of the 
third day from now we should come to the Hold. The Moon will then be one 
night past his full, and the muster that the king commanded will be held the 
day after. More speed we cannot make, if the strength of Rohan is to be 
gathered.' 

Aragorn was silent for a moment. 'Three days,' he murmured, 'and the 
muster of Rohan will only be begun. But I see that it cannot now be 
hastened.' He looked up, and it seemed that he had made some decision; his 
face was less troubled. Then, by our leave, lord, I must take new counsel 
for myself and my kindred. We must ride our own road, and no longer in 
secret. For me the time of stealth has passed. I will ride east by the 
swiftest way, and I will take the Paths of the Dead.' 

'The Paths of the Dead!' said Thjoden, and trembled. 'Why do you speak 
of them?' Jomer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it seemed to Merry that the 
faces of the Riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words. 'If 
there be in truth such paths,' said Thjoden, 'their gate is in Dunharrow; 
but no living man may pass it.' 

'Alas! Aragorn my friend!' said Jomer. 'I had hoped that we should ride 
to war together; but if you seek the Paths of the Dead, then our parting is 
come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the Sun.' 

'That road I will take, nonetheless,' said Aragorn. 'But I say to you, 

Jomer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor 
should stand between.' 

'You will do as you will, my lord Aragorn,' said Thjoden. 'It is your 




doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. This parting 
grieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now I must take the 
mountain-roads and delay no longer. Farewell!' 

’Farewell, lord!' said Aragorn. 'Ride unto great renown! Farewell, 

Merry! I leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the 
ores to Fangorn. Legolas and Gimli will still hunt with me, I hope; but we 
shall not forget you.' 

'Good-bye!' said Merry. Fie could find no more to say. Fie felt very 
small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. More than 
ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of Pippin. The Riders were 
ready, and their horses were fidgeting; he wished they would start arid get 
it over. 

Now Thjoden spoke to Jomer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, 
and with that word the Riders set forth. They rode over the Dike and down 
the Coomb, and then, turning swiftly eastwards, they took a path that 
skirted the foothills for a mile or so, until bending south it passed back 
among the hills and disappeared from view. Aragorn rode to the Dike and 
watched till the king's men were far down the Coomb. Then he turned to 
Halbarad. 

'There go three that I love, and the smallest not the least,' he said. 

'He knows not to what end he rides; yet if he knew, he still would go on.' 

'A little people, but of great worth are the Shire-folk,' said 
Halbarad. 'Little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of 
their borders, and yet I grudge it not.' 

'And now our fates are woven together,' said Aragorn. 'And yet, alas! 
here we must part. Well, I must eat a little, and then we also must hasten 
away. Come, Legolas and Gimli! I must speak with you as I eat.' 

Together they went back into the Burg; yet for some time Aragorn sat 
silent at the table in the hall, and the others waited for him to speak. 

'Come!' said Legolas at last. 'Speak and be comforted, and shake off the 
shadow! What has happened since we came back to this grim place in the grey 
morning?' 

'A struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the 
Hornburg,' answered Aragorn. 'I have looked in the Stone of Orthanc, my 
friends.' 

'You have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry!' exclaimed Gimli 
with fear and astonishment in his face. 'Did you say aught to - him? Even 




Gandalf feared that encounter.' 

'You forget to whom you speak,' said Aragorn sternly, and his eyes 
glinted. 'Did I not openly proclaim my title before the doors ofEdoras? 

What do you fear that I should say to him? Nay, Gimli,' he said in a softer 
voice, and the grimness left his face, and he looked like one who has 
laboured in sleepless pain for many nights. 'Nay, my friends, I and the 
lawful master of the Stone, and I had both the right and the strength to use 
it, or so I judged. The right cannot be doubted. The strength was enough - 
barely.' 

He drew a deep breath. 'It was a bitter struggle, and the weariness is 
slow to pass. I spoke no word to him, and in the end I wrenched the Stone to 
my own will. That alone he will find hard to endure. And he beheld me. Yes, 
Master Gimli, he saw me, but in other guise than you see me here. If that 
will aid him, then I have done ill. But I do not think so. To know that I 
lived and walked the earth was a blow to his heart, I deem; for he knew it 
not till now. The eyes in Orthanc did not see through the armour of Thjoden; 
but Sauron has not forgotten Isildur and the sword of Elendil. Now in the 
very hour of his great designs the heir of Isildur and the Sword are 
revealed; for 1 showed the blade re-forged to him. He is not so mighty yet 
that he is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.' 

'But he wields great dominion, nonetheless,' said Gimli; 'and now he 
will strike more swiftly.' 

'The hasty stroke goes oft astray,' said Aragorn. 'We must press our 
Enemy, and no longer wait upon him for the move. See my friends, when I had 
mastered the Stone, I learned many things. A grave peril I saw coming 
unlooked-for upon Gondor from the South that will draw off great strength 
from the defence of Minas Tirith. If it is not countered swiftly, I deem 
that the City will be lost ere ten days be gone.' 

'Then lost it must be,' said Gimli. 'For what help is there to send 
thither, and how could it come there in time?' 

'I have no help to send, therefore I must go myself,' said Aragorn. 

'But there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me to the 
coastlands before all is lost. That is the Paths of the Dead.' 

'The Paths of the Dead!' said Gimli. 'It is a fell name; and little to 
the liking to the Men of Rohan, as I saw. Can the living use such a road and 
not perish? And even if you pass that way, what will so few avail to counter 
the strokes of Mordor?' 




’The living have never used that road since the coming of the 
Rohirrim,' said Aragorn, 'for it is closed to them. But in this dark hour 
the heir of Isildur may use it, if he dare. Listen! This is the word that 
the sons of Elrond bring to me from their father in Rivendell, wisest in 
lore: Bid Aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the Paths of the 
Dead' 

'And what may be the words of the seer?' said Legolas. 

"Thus spoke Malbeth the Seer, in the days of Arvedui, last king at 
Fornost,' said Aragorn: 

Over the land there lies a long shadow, 
westward reaching wings of darkness. 

The Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings 
doom approaches. The Dead awaken; 
for the hour is come for the oathbreakers ; 
at the Stone of Erech they shall stand again 
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing. 

Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them 
from the prey twilight, the forgotten people? 

The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. 

From the North shall he come, need shall drive him: 
he shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead. 

'Dark ways doubtless, said Gimli, but no darker than these staves are 
to me.' 

'If you would understand them better, then I bid you come with me,' 
said Aragorn; 'for that way I now shall take. But I do not go gladly; only 
need drives me. Therefore, only of your free will would I have you come, for 
you will find both toil and great fear, and maybe worse.' 

'I will go with you even on the Paths of the Dead, and to whatever, end 
they may lead,' said Gimli. 

'I also will come,' said Legolas, 'for I do not fear the Dead.' 

'I hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to 
fight,' said Gimli; 'for otherwise I see not why we should trouble them.' 

'That we shall know if ever we come to Erech,' said Aragorn. 'But the 
oath that they broke was to fight against Sauron, and they must fight 
therefore, if they are to fulfil it. For at Erech there stands yet a black 
stone that was brought, it was said, from N®menor by Isildur; and it was set 
upon a hill, and upon it the King of the Mountains swore allegiance to him 




in the beginning of the realm of Gondor. But when Sauron returned and grew 
in might again, Isildur summoned the Men of the Mountains to fulfil their 
oath, and they would not: for they had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years. 

’Then Isildur said to their king: "Thou shalt be the last king. And if 
the West prove mightier than thy Black Master, this curse I lay upon thee 
and thy folk: to rest never until your oath is fulfilled. For this war will 
last through years uncounted, and you shall be summoned once again ere the 
end." And they fled before the wrath of Isildur, and did not dare to go 
forth to war on Sauron's part; and they hid themselves in secret places in 
the mountains and had no dealings with other men, but slowly dwindled in the 
barren hills. And the terror of the Sleepless Dead lies about the Hill of 
Erech and all places where that people lingered. But that way I must go, 
since there are none living to help me.' 

He stood up. ’Come!' he cried, and drew his sword, and it flashed in 
the twilit hall of the Burg. 'To the Stone of Erech! I seek the Paths of the 
Dead. Come with me who will!' 

Legolas and Gimli made no answer, but they rose and followed Aragorn 
from the hall. On the green there waited, still and silent, the hooded 
Rangers. Legolas and Gimli mounted. Aragorn sprang upon Roheryn. 

Then 

Halbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in Helm's Deep; and 
with that they leapt away, riding down the Coomb like thunder, while all the 
men that were left on Dike or Burg stared in amaze. 

And while Thjoden went by slow paths in the hills, the Grey Company 
passed swiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they 
came to Edoras; and there they halted only briefly, ere they passed up the 
valley, and so came to Dunharrow as darkness fell. 

The Lady Jowyn greeted them and was glad of their coming; for no 
mightier men had she seen than the D®nedain and the fair sons of Elrond; but 
on Aragorn most of all her eyes rested. And when they sat at supper with 
her, they talked together, and she heard of all that had passed since 
Thjoden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her; 
and when she heard of the battle in Helm's Deep and the great slaughter of 
their foes, and of the charge of Thjoden and his knights, then her eyes 
shone. 

But at last she said: 'Lords, you are weary and shall now go to your 
beds with such ease as can be contrived in haste. But tomorrow fairer 




housing shall be found for you.' 

But Aragorn said: 'Nay, lady, be not troubled for us! If we may lie 
here tonight and break our fast tomorrow, it will be enough. For I ride on 
an errand most urgent, and with the first light of morning we must go.' 

She smiled on him and said: 'Then it was kindly done, lord, to ride so 
many miles out of your way to bring tidings to Jowyn, and to speak with her 
in her exile.' 

'Indeed no man would count such a journey wasted,' said Aragorn; 'and 
yet, lady, I could not have come hither, if it were not that the road which 
I must take leads me to Dunharrow.' 

And she answered as one that likes not what is said: "Then, lord, you 
are astray; for out of Harrowdale no road runs east or south; and you had 
best return as you came.' 

'Nay, lady,' said he, 'I am not astray; for I walked in this land ere 
you were born to grace it. There is a road out of this valley, and that road 
I shall take. Tomorrow I shall ride by the Paths of the Dead.' 

Then she stared at him as one that is stricken, and her face blanched, 
and for long she spoke no more, while all sat silent. 'But, Aragorn,' she 
said at last, 'is it then your errand to seek death? For that is all that 
you will find on that road. They do not suffer the living to pass.' 

'They may suffer me to pass,' said Aragorn; 'but at the least I will 
adventure it. No other road will serve.' 

'But this is madness,' she said. 'For here are men of renown and 
prowess, whom you should not take into the shadows, but should lead to war, 
where men are needed. I beg you to remain and ride with my brother; for then 
all our hearts will be gladdened, and our hope be the brighter.' 

'It is not madness, lady,' he answered; 'for I go on a path appointed. 

But those who follow me do so of their free will; and if they wish now to 
remain and ride with the Rohirrim, they may do so. But I shall take the 
Paths of the Dead, alone, if needs be.' 

Then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever 
upon Aragorn, and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. At 
length they arose, and took their leave of the Lady, and thanked her for her 
care, and went to their rest. 

But as Aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with Legolas and 
Gimli, and his companions had gone in. there came the Lady Jowyn after him 
and called to him. He turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night, for she 




was clad in white; but her eyes were on fire. 

'Aragorn,' she said, ’why will you go on this deadly road?' 

’Because I must,' he said. 'Only so can I see any hope of doing my part 
in the war against Sauron. I do not choose paths of peril, Jowyn. Were I to 
go where my heart dwells, far in the North I would now be wandering in the 
fair valley of Rivendell.' 

For a while she was silent, as if pondering what this might mean. Then 
suddenly she laid her hand on his arm. 'You are a stern lord and resolute,' 
she said; 'and thus do men win renown.' She paused. 'Lord.' she said, 'if 
you must go, then let me ride in your following. For I am weary of skulking 
in the hills, and wish to face peril and battle.' 

'Your duty is with your people,' he answered. 

'Too often have I heard of duty,' she cried. 'But am I not of the House 
of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? I have waited on faltering feet 
long enough. Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not now spend my 
life as I will?' 

'Few may do that with honour,' he answered. 'But as for you, lady: did 
you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord's return? If 
you had not been chosen, then some marshal or captain would have been set in 
the same place, and he could not ride away from his charge, were he weary of 
it or no.' 

'Shall I always be chosen?' she said bitterly. 'Shall I always be left 
behind when the Riders depart, to mind the house while they win renown, and 
find food and beds when they return?' 

'A time may come soon,' said he, 'when none will return. Then there 
will be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember the deeds 
that are done in the last defence of your homes. Yet the deeds will not be 
less valiant because they are unpraised.' 

And she answered: 'All your words are but to say: you are a woman, and 
your part is in the house. But when the men have died in battle and honour, 
you have leave to be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. 
But I am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield 
blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.' 

'What do you fear, lady?' he asked. 

'A cage,' she said. 'To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept 
them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.' 

'And yet you counselled me not to adventure on the road that I had 




chosen, because it is perilous?' 

’So may one counsel another,' she said. 'Yet I do not bid you flee from 
peril, but to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory. I 
would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly.' 

'Nor would I,' he said. 'Therefore I say to you, lady: Stay! For you 
have no errand to the South.' 

'Neither have those others who go with thee. They go only because they 
would not be parted from thee - because they love thee.' Then she turned and 
vanished into the night. 

When the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet 
risen above the high ridges in the East, Aragorn made ready to depart. His 
company was all mounted, and he was about to leap into the saddle, when the 
Lady Jowyn came to bid them farewell. She was clad as a Rider and girt with 
a sword. In her hand she bore a cup, and she set it to her lips and drank a 
little, wishing them good speed; and then she gave the cup to Aragorn, and 
he drank, and he said: 'Farewell, Lady of Rohan! I drink to the fortunes of 
your House, and of you, and of all your people. Say to your brother: beyond 
the shadows we may meet again!' 

Then it seemed to Gimli and Legolas who were nearby that she wept, and 
in one so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous. But she said: 
'Aragorn, wilt thou go?' 

'I will,' he said. 

'Then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as I have asked?' 

'I will not, lady,' he said. 'For that I could not grant without leave 
of the king and of your brother; and they will not return until tomorrow. 

But I count now every hour, indeed every minute. Farewell!' 

Then she fell on her knees, saying: 'I beg thee!' 

'Nay, lady,' he said, and taking her by the hand he raised her. Then he 
kissed her hand, and sprang into the saddle, and rode away, and did not look 
back; and only those who knew him well and were near to him saw the pain 
that he bore. 

But Jowyn stood still as a figure carven in stone, her hands clenched 
at her sides, and she watched them until they passed into the shadows under 
the black Dwimorberg, the Haunted Mountain, in which was the Gate of the 
Dead. When they were lost to view, she turned, stumbling as one that is 
blind, and went back to her lodging. But none of her folk saw this parting, 
for they hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until the day was 




up, and the reckless strangers were gone. 

And some said: 'They are Elvish wights. Let them go where they belong, 
into the dark places, and never return. The times are evil enough.' 

The light was still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed 
over the black ridges of the Haunted Mountain before them. A dread fell on 
them, even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to 
the Dimholt. There under the gloom of black trees that not even Legolas 
could long endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountain's root, 
and right in their path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom. 

'My blood runs chill,' said Gimli, but the others were silent, and his 
voice fell dead on the dank fir-needles at his feet. The horses would not 
pass the threatening stone, until the riders dismounted and led them about. 
And so they came at last deep into the glen; and there stood a sheer wall of 
rock, and in the wall the Dark Door gaped before them like the mouth of 
night. Signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read, 
and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour. 

The company halted, and there was not a heart among them that did not 
quail, unless it were the heart of Legolas of the Elves, for whom the ghosts 
of Men have no terror. 

'This is an evil door,' said Halbarad, 'and my death lies beyond it. I 
will dare to pass it nonetheless; but no horse will enter.' 

'But we must go in, and therefore the horses must go too,' said 
Aragorn. 'Lor if ever we come through this darkness, many leagues lie 
beyond, and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of Sauron 
nearer. Lollow me!' 

Then Aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will in that 
hour that all the D®nedain and their horses followed him. And indeed the 
love that the horses of the Rangers bore for their riders was so great that 
they were willing to face even the terror of the Door, if their masters' 
hearts were steady as they walked beside them. But Arod, the horse of Rohan, 
refused the way, and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was 
grievous to see. Then Legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words 
that went soft in the gloom, until he suffered himself to be led, and 
Legolas passed in. And there stood Gimli the Dwarf left all alone. 

His knees shook, and he was wroth with himself. 'Here is a thing 
unheard of!' he said. 'An Elf will go underground and a Dwarf dare not!' 
With that he plunged in. But it seemed to him that he dragged his feet like 




lead over the threshold; and at once a blindness came upon him, even upon 
Gimli Gluin’s son who had walked unafraid in many deep places of the world. 

Aragorn had brought torches from Dunharrow, and now he went ahead 
bearing one aloft; and Elladan with another went at the rear, and Gimli, 
stumbling behind, strove to overtake him. He could see nothing but the dim 
flame of the torches; but if the company halted, there seemed an endless 
whisper of voices all about him, a murmur of words in no tongue that he had 
ever heard before. 

Nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage, and yet 
steadily fear grew on the Dwarf as he went on: most of all because he knew 
now that there could be no turning back; all the paths behind were thronged 
by an unseen host that followed in the dark. 

So time unreckoned passed, until Gimli saw a sight that he was ever 
afterwards loth to recall. The road was wide, as far as he could judge, but 
now the company came suddenly into a great empty space, and there were no 
longer any walls upon either side. The dread was so heavy on him that he 
could hardly walk. Away to the left something glittered in the gloom as 
Aragorn's torch drew near. Then Aragorn halted and went to look what it 
might be. 

'Does he feel no fear?' muttered the Dwarf. 'In any other cave Gimli 
Gluin's son would have been the first to run to the gleam of gold. But not 
here! Let it lie!' 

Nonetheless he drew near, and saw Aragorn kneeling, while Elladan held 
aloft both torches. Before him were the bones of a mighty man. He had been 
clad in mail, and still his harness lay there whole; for the cavern's air 
was as dry as dust, and his hauberk was gilded. His belt was of gold and 
garnets, and rich with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on 
the floor. He had fallen near the far wall of the cave, as now could be 
seen, and before him stood a stony door closed fast: his finger -bones were 
still clawing at the cracks. A notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he 
had hewn at the rock in his last despair. 

Aragorn did not touch him, but after gazing silently for a while he 
rose and sighed. 'Hither shall the flowers of simbelmynl come never unto 
world's end,' he murmured. 'Nine mounds and seven there are now green with 
grass, and through all the long years he has lain at the door that he could 
not unlock. Whither does it lead? Why would he pass? None shall ever know! 

'For that is not my errand!' he cried, turning back and speaking to the 




whispering darkness behind. 'Keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the 
Accursed Years! Speed only we ask. Let us pass, and then come! I summon 
you 

to the Stone of Erech!' 

There was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than 
the whispers before; and then a chill blast came in which the torches 
flickered and went out, and could not be rekindled. Of the time that 
followed, one hour or many, Gimli remembered little. The others pressed on, 
but he was ever hindmost, pursued by a groping horror that seemed always 
just about to seize him; and a rumour came after him like the shadow-sound 
of many feet. He stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast on the 
ground and felt that he could endure no more: he must either find an ending 
and escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear. 

Suddenly he heard the tinkle of water, a sound hard and clear as a 
stone falling into a dream of dark shadow. Light grew, and lo! the company 
passed through another gateway, high-arched and broad, and a rill ran out 
beside them; and beyond, going steeply down, was a road between sheer 
cliffs, knife-edged against the sky far above. So deep and narrow was that 
chasm that the sky was dark, and in it small stars glinted. Yet as Gimli 
after learned it was still two hours ere sunset of the day on which they had 
set out from Dunharrow; though for all that he could then tell it might have 
been twilight in some later year, or in some other world. 

The Company now mounted again, and Gimli returned to Legolas. They 
rode 

in file, and evening came on and a deep blue dusk; and still fear pursued 
them. Legolas turning to speak to Gimli looked back and the Dwarf saw before 
his face the glitter in the Elf s bright eyes. Behind them rode Elladan, 
last of the Company, but not the last of those that took the downward road. 

The Dead are following,' said Legolas. 'I see shapes of Men and of 
horses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like 
winter-thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.' 

'Yes, the Dead ride behind. They have been summoned,' said Elladan. 

The Company came at last out of the ravine, as suddenly as it they had 
issued from a crack in a wall; and there lay the uplands of a great vale 
before them, and the stream beside them went down with a cold voice over 
many falls. 

'Where in Middle-earth are we?' said Gimli; and Elladan answered: 'We 




have descended from the uprising of the Morthond, the long chill river that 
flows at last to the sea that washes the walls of Dol Amroth. You will not 
need to ask hereafter how comes its name: Blackroot men call it.' 

The Morthond Vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer 
southern faces of the mountains. Its steep slopes were grass-grown; but all 
was grey in that hour, for the sun had gone, and far below lights twinkled 
in the homes of Men. The vale was rich and many folk dwelt there. 

Then without turning Aragorn cried aloud so that all could hear: 
’Friends, forget your weariness! Ride now, ride! We must come to the Stone 
of Erech ere this day passes, and long still is the way.' So without looking 
back they rode the mountain-fields, until they came to a bridge over the 
growing torrent and found a road that went down into the land. 

Lights went out in house and hamlet as they came, and doors were shut, 
and folk that were afield cried in terror and ran wild like hunted deer. 

Ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night: 'The King of the Dead! 
The King of the Dead is come upon us!' 

Bells were ringing far below, and all men fled before the face of 
Aragorn; but the Grey Company in their haste rode like hunters, until their 
horses were stumbling with weariness. And thus, just ere midnight, and in a 
darkness as black as the caverns in the mountains, they came at last to the 
Hill of Erech. 

Long had the terror of the Dead lain upon that hill and upon the empty 
fields about it. For upon the top stood a black stone, round as a great 
globe, the height of a man, though its half was buried in the ground. 
Unearthly it looked, as though it had fallen from the sky, as some believed; 
but those who remembered still the lore of Westernesse told that it had been 
brought out of the ruin of N®menor and there set by Isildur at his landing. 
None of the people of the valley dared to approach it, nor would they dwell 
near; for they said that it was a try sting -place of the Shadow-men, and 
there they would gather in times of fear, thronging round the Stone and 
whispering. 

To that Stone the Company came and halted in the dead of night. Then 
Elrohir gave to Aragorn a silver horn, and he blew upon it and it seemed to 
those that stood near that they heard a sound of answering horns, as if it 
was an echo in deep caves far away. No other sound they heard, and yet they 
were aware of a great host gathered all about the hill on which they stood; 
and a chill wind like the breath of ghosts came down from the mountains. But 




Aragorn dismounted, and standing by the Stone he cried in a great voice: 

'Oathbreakers, why have ye come?' 

And a voice was heard out of the night that answered him, as if from 
far away: 

’To fulfil our oath and have peace.' 

Then Aragorn said: ’The hour is come at last. Now I go to Pelargir upon 
Anduin, and ye shall come after me. And when all this land is clean of the 
servants of Sauron, I will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace 
and depart for ever. For I am Elessar, Isildur's heir of Gondor.’ 

And with that he bade Halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had 
brought; and behold! it was black, and if there was any device upon it, it 
was hidden in the darkness. Then there was silence, and not a whisper nor a 
sigh was heard again all the long night. The Company camped beside the 
Stone, but they slept little, because of the dread of the Shadows that 
hedged them round. 

But when the dawn came, cold and pale, Aragorn rose at once, and he led 
the Company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any 
among them had known, save he alone, and only his will held them to go on. 
No other mortal Men could have endured it, none but the D®nedain of the 
North, and with them Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas of the Elves. 

They passed Tarlang’s Neck and came into Lamedon; and the Shadow 
Host 

pressed behind and fear went on before them, until they came to Calembel 
upon Ciril, and the sun went down like blood behind Pinnath Gelin away in 
the West behind them. The township and the fords of Ciril they found 
deserted, for many men had gone away to war, and all that were left fled to 
the hills at the rumour of the coming of the King of the Dead. But the next 
day there came no dawn, and the Grey Company passed on into the darkness 
of 

the Storm of Mordor and were lost to mortal sight; but the Dead followed 
them. 




Chapter 3 . The Muster of Rohan 



Now all roads were running together to the East to meet the coming of 
war and the onset of the Shadow. And even as Pippin stood at the Great Gate 
of the City and saw the Prince of Dol Amroth ride in with his banners, the 
King of Rohan came down out of the hills. 

Day was waning. In the last rays of the sun the Riders cast long 
pointed shadows that went on before them. Darkness had already crept beneath 
the murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain -sides. The king rode 
now slowly at the end of the day. Presently the path turned round a huge 
bare shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft -sighing trees. 
Down, down they went in a long winding file. When at last they came to the 
bottom of the gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places. 

The sun was gone. Twilight lay upon the waterfalls. 

All day far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass 
behind, cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad walls; and now through a 
stony gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale. The Riders followed 
it, and suddenly Harrowdale lay before them, loud with the noise of waters 
in the evening. There the white Snowbourn, joined by the lesser stream, went 
rushing, fuming on the stones, down to Edoras and the green hills and the 
plains. Away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty Starkhorn 
loomed up above its vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but its jagged peak, 
clothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the world, blue-shadowed upon 
the East, red-stained by the sunset in the West. 

Merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country, of which he had 
heard many tales upon their long road. It was a skyless world, in which his 
eye; through dim gulfs of shadowy air, saw only ever-mounting slopes, great 
walls of stone behind great walls, and frowning precipices wreathed with 
mist. He sat for a moment half dreaming, listening to the noise of water, 
the whisper of dark trees, the crack of stone, and the vast waiting silence 
that brooded behind all sound. He loved mountains, or he had loved the 
thought of them marching on the edge of stories brought from far away; but 
now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of Middle-earth. He 
longed 

to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire. 

He was very tired, for though they had ridden slowly, they had ridden 




with very little rest. Hour after hour for nearly three weary days he had 
jogged up and down, over passes, and through long dales, and across many 
streams. Sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at the king’s 
side, not noticing that many of the Riders smiled to see the two together: 
the hobbit on his little shaggy grey pony, and the Lord of Rohan on his 
great white horse. Then he had talked to Thjoden, telling him about his home 
and the doings of the Shire-folk, or listening in turn to tales of the Mark 
and its mighty men of old. But most of the time, especially on this last 
day, Merry had ridden by himself just behind the king, saying nothing, and 
trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of Rohan that he heard the men 
behind him using. It was a language in which there seemed to be many words 
that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the Shire, yet 
he could not piece the words together. At times some Rider would lift up his 
clear voice in stirring song, and Merry felt his heart leap, though he did 
not know what it was about. 

All the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the 
day’s end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin had got to; 
and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly 
like a 

cold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. 'I am forgetting them!' 
he said to himself reproachfully. 'And yet they are more important than all 
the rest of us. And I came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of 
miles away, if they are still alive.' He shivered. 

'Harrowdale at last!' said Jomer. 'Our journey is almost at an end.' 

They halted. The paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. Only a glimpse, 
as through a tall window, could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming 
below. A single small light could be seen twinkling by the river. 

'This journey is over, maybe,' said Thjoden, 'but I have far yet to go. 

Last night the moon was full, and in the morning I shall ride to Edoras to 
the gathering of the Mark.' 

'But if you would take my counsel,' said Jomer in a low voice, 'you 
would then return hither, until the war is over, lost or won.' 

Thjoden smiled. 'Nay, my son, for so I will call you, speak not the 
soft words of Wormtongue in my old ears!' He drew himself up and looked 
back 

at the long line of his men fading into the dusk behind. 'Long years in the 
space of days it seems since I rode west; but never will I lean on a staff 




again. If the war is lost, what good will be my hiding in the hills? And if 
it is won, what grief will it be, even if I fall, spending my last strength? 

But we will leave this now. Tonight I will lie in the Hold of Dunharrow. One 
evening of peace at least is left us. Let us ride on!' 

In the deepening dusk they came down into the valley. Here the 
Snowbourn flowed near to the western walls of the dale, and soon the path 
led them to a ford where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the stones. 
The ford was guarded. As the king approached many men sprang up out of the 
shadow of the rocks; and when they saw the king they cried with glad voices: 
'Thjoden King! Thjoden King! The King of the Mark returns!' 

Then one blew a long call on a horn. It echoed in the valley. Other 
horns answered it, and lights shone out across the river. 

And suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from high above, 
sounding from some hollow place, as it seemed, that gathered their notes 
into one voice and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of stone. 

So the King of the Mark came back victorious out of the West to 
Dunharrow beneath the feet of the White Mountains. There he found the 
remaining strength of his people already assembled; for as soon as his 
coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford, bearing messages 
from Gandalf. D®nhere, chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale, was at their 
head. 

'At dawn three days ago, lord,' he said. 'Shadowfax came like a wind 
out of the West to Edoras, and Gandalf brought tidings of your victory to 
gladden our hearts. But he brought also word from you to hasten the 
gathering of the Riders. And then came the winged Shadow.' 

'The winged Shadow?' said Thjoden. 'We saw it also, but that was in the 
dead of night before Gandalf left us.' 

'Maybe, lord,' said D®nhere. 'Yet the same, or another like to it, a 
flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird, passed over Edoras that 
morning, and all men were shaken with fear. For it stooped upon Meduseld, 
and as it came low, almost to the gable, there came a cry that stopped our 
hearts. Then it was that Gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the 
fields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains. And he bade 
us to kindle no more lights or fires than barest need asked. So it has been 
done. Gandalf spoke with great authority. We trust that it is as you would 
wish. Naught has been seen in Harrowdale of these evil things.' 

'It is well,' said Thjoden. 'I will ride now to the Hold, and there 




before I go to rest I will meet the marshals and captains. Let them come to 
me as soon as may be!' 

The road now led eastward straight across the valley, which was at that 
point little more than half a mile in width. Flats and meads of rough grass, 
grey now in the falling night, lay all about, but in front on the far side 
of the dale Merry saw a frowning wall, a last outlier of the great roots of 
the Starkhorn, cloven by the river in ages past. 

On all the level spaces there was great concourse of men. Some thronged 
to the roadside, hailing the king and the riders from the West with glad 
cries; but stretching away into the distance behind there were ordered rows 
of tents and booths, and lines of picketed horses, and great store of arms, 
and piled spears bristling like thickets of new-planted trees. Now all the 
great assembly was falling into shadow, and yet, though the night-chill blew 
cold from the heights no lanterns glowed, no fires were lit. Watchmen 
heavily cloaked paced to and fro. 

Merry wondered how many Riders there were. He could not guess their 
number in the gathering gloom, but it looked to him like a great army, many 
thousands strong. While he was peering from side to side the king’s party 
came up under the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley; and there 
suddenly the path began to climb, and Merry looked up in amazement. He 
was 

on a road the like of which he had never seen before, a great work of men’s 
hands in years beyond the reach of song. Upwards it wound, coiling like a 
snake, boring its way across the sheer slope of rock. Steep as a stair, it 
looped backwards and forwards as it climbed. Up it horses could walk, and 
wains could be slowly hauled; but no enemy could come that way, except out 
of the air, if it was defended from above. At each turn of the road there 
were great standing stones that had been carved in the likeness of men, huge 
and clumsy-limbed, squatting cross-legged with their stumpy arms folded on 
fat bellies. Some in the wearing of the years had lost all features save the 
dark holes of their eyes that still stared sadly at the passers-by. The 
Riders hardly glanced at them. The P®kel-men they called them, and heeded 
them little: no power or terror was left in them; but Merry gazed at them 
with wonder and a feeling almost of pity, as they loomed up mournfully in 
the dusk. 

After a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some 
hundreds of feet above the valley, but still far below he could dimly see a 




winding line of Riders crossing the ford and filing along the road towards 
the camp prepared for them. Only the king and his guard were going up into 
the Hold. 

At last the king’s company came to a sharp brink, and the climbing road 
passed into a cutting between walls of rock, and so went up a short slope 
and out on to a wide upland. The Firienfeld men called it, a green 
mountain-field of grass and heath, high above the deep -delved courses of the 
Snowbourn, laid upon the lap of the great mountains behind: the Starkhorn 
southwards, and northwards the saw-toothed mass of Irensaga, between which 
there faced the riders, the grim black wall of the Dwimorberg, the Haunted 
Mountain rising out of steep slopes of sombre pines. Dividing the upland 
into two there marched a double line of unshaped standing stones that 
dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees. Those who dared to follow 
that road came soon to the black Dimholt under Dwimorberg, and the menace 
of 

the pillar of stone, and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door. 

Such was the dark Dunharrow, the work of long -forgotten men. Their name 
was lost and no song or legend remembered it. For what purpose they had 
made 

this place, as a town or secret temple or a tomb of kings, none could say. 

Here they laboured in the Dark Years, before ever a ship came to the western 
shores, or Gondor of the D®nedain was built; and now they had vanished, and 
only the old P®kel-men were left, still sitting at the turnings of the road. 

Merry stared at the lines of marching stones: they were worn and black; 
some were leaning, some were fallen, some cracked or broken; they looked 
like rows of old and hungry teeth. He wondered what they could be, and he 
hoped that the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond. 
Then he saw that there were clusters of tents and booths on either side of 
the stony way; but these were not set near the trees, and seemed rather to 
huddle away from them towards the brink of the cliff. The greater number 
were on the right, where the Firienfeld was wider; and on the left there was 
a smaller camp, in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion. From this side 
a rider now came out to meet them, and they turned from the road. 

As they drew near Merry saw that the rider was a woman with long 
braided hair gleaming in the twilight, yet she wore a helm and was clad to 
the waist like a warrior and girded with a sword. 

'Hail, Lord of the Mark!' she cried. ’My heart is glad at your 




returning.' 

'And you, Jowyn,' said Thjoden, 'is all well with you?' 

'All is well,' she answered; yet it seemed to Merry that her voice 
belied her, and he would have thought that she had been weeping, if that 
could be believed of one so stern of face. 'All is well. It was a weary road 
for the people to take, torn suddenly from their homes. There were hard 
words, for it is long since war has driven us from the green fields; but 
there have been no evil deeds. All is now ordered, as you see. And your 
lodging is prepared for you; for I have had full tidings of you and knew the 
hour of your coming.' 

'So Aragorn has come then,' said Jomer. 'Is he still here?' 

'No, he is gone,' said Jowyn turning away and looking at the mountains 
dark against the East and South. 

'Whither did he go?' asked Jomer. 

'I do not know,' she answered. 'He came at night, and rode away 
yestermorn, ere the Sun had climbed over the mountain-tops. He is gone.' 

'You are grieved, daughter,' said Thjoden. 'What has happened? Tell me, 
did he speak of that road?' He pointed away along the darkening lines of 
stones towards the Dwimorberg. 'Of the Paths of the Dead?' 

'Yes, lord,' said Jowyn. 'And he has passed into the shadows from which 
none have returned. I could not dissuade him. He is gone.' 

'Then our paths are sundered,' said Jomer. 'He is lost. We must ride 
without him, and our hope dwindles.' 

Slowly they passed through the short heath and upland grass, speaking 
no more, until they came to the king's pavilion. There Merry found that 
everything was made ready, and that he himself was not forgotten. A little 
tent had been pitched for him beside the king's lodging; and there he sat 
alone, while men passed to and fro, going in to the king and taking counsel 
with him. Night came on, and the half-seen heads of the mountains westward 
were crowned with stars, but the East was dark and blank. The marching 
stones faded slowly from sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the 
gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the Dwimorberg. 

'The Paths of the Dead,' he muttered to himself. 'The Paths of the 
Dead? What does all this mean? They have all left me now. They have all gone 
to some doom: Gandalf and Pippin to war in the East; and Sam and Frodo to 
Mordor; and Strider and Legolas and Gimli to the Paths of the Dead. But my 
turn will come soon enough, I suppose. I wonder what they are all talking 




about, and what the king means to do. For I must go where he goes now.’ 

In the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he 
was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange 
camp felt the same. But at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man 
came summoning him, the king's esquire, to wait at the king's board. 

In the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with 
broidered hangings, and strewn with skins: and there at a small table sat 
Thjoden with Jomer and Jowyn, and D®nhere, lord of Harrowdale. Merry 
stood 

beside the king's stool and waited on him till presently the old man, coming 
out of deep thought, turned to him and smiled. 

'Come, Master Meriadoc!' he said. 'You shall not stand. You shall sit 
beside me, as long as I remain in my own lands, and lighten my heart with 
tales.' 

Room was made for the hobbit at the king's left hand, but no one called 
for any tale. There was indeed little speech, and they ate and drank for the 
most part in silence, until at last, plucking up courage, Merry asked the 
question that was tormenting him. 

'Twice now, lord, I have heard of the Paths of the Dead,' he said. 

'What are they? And where has Strider, I mean the Lord Aragorn where has he 
gone?' 

The king sighed, but no one answered, until at last Jomer spoke. 'We do 
not know, and our hearts are heavy,' he said. 'But as for the Paths of the 
Dead, you have yourself walked on their first steps. Nay. I speak no words 
of ill omen! The road that we have climbed is the approach to the Door, 
yonder in the Dimholt. But what lies beyond no man knows.' 

'No man knows,' said Thjoden: 'yet ancient legend, now seldom spoken, 
has somewhat to report. If these old tales speak true that have come down 
from father to son in the House of Eorl, then the Door under Dwimorberg 
leads to a secret way that goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end. 
But none have ever ventured in to search its secrets, since Baldor, son of 
Brego, passed the Door and was never seen among men again. A rash vow 
he 

spoke, as he drained the horn at that feast which Brego made to hallow 
new-built Meduseld, and he came never to the high seat of which he was the 
heir. 

'Folk say that Dead Men out of the Dark Years guard the way and will 




suffer no living man to come to their hidden halls; but at whiles they may 
themselves be seen passing out of the door like shadows and down the stony 
road. Then the people of Harrowdale shut fast their doors and shroud their 
windows and are afraid. But the Dead come seldom forth and only at times of 
great unquiet and coming death.' 

'Yet it is said in Harrowdale,' said Jowyn in a low voice, 'that in the 
moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed 
by. Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and 
vanished 

into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.' 

'Then why has Aragorn gone that way?' asked Merry. 'Don't you know 
anything that would explain it?' 

'Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not 
heard,' said Jomer, 'none now in the land of the living can tell his 
purpose.' 

'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the king's 
house,' said Jowyn: 'grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and like one whom 
the Dead call.' 

'Maybe he was called,' said Thjoden; 'and my heart tells me that I 
shall not see him again. Yet he is a kingly man of high destiny. And take 
comfort in this, daughter, since comfort you seem to need in your grief for 
this guest. It is said that when the Eorlingas came out of the North and 
passed at length up the Snowbourn, seeking strong places of refuge in time 
of need, Brego and his son Baldor climbed the Stair of the Hold and so came 
before the Door. On the threshold sat an old man, aged beyond guess of 
years; tall and kingly he had been, but now he was withered as an old stone. 
Indeed for stone they took him, for he moved not, and he said no word, until 
they sought to pass him by and enter. And then a voice came out of him, as 
it were out of the ground, and to their amaze it spoke in the western 
tongue: The way is shut. 

'Then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still; but he 
did not look at them. The way is shut, his voice said again It was made by 
those who are Dead, and the Dead keep it, until the time comes. The way is 
shut. 

'And when will that time be? said Baldor. But no answer did he ever 
get. For the old man died in that hour and fell upon his face; and no other 
tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned. 




Yet maybe at last the time foretold has come, and Aragorn may pass.' 

'But how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no, save by 
daring the Door?' said Jomer. 'And that way I would not go though all the 
hosts of Mordor stood before me, and I were alone and had no other refuge. 
Alas that a fey mood should fall on a man so greathearted in this hour of 
need! Are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the 
earth? War is at hand.' 

He paused, for at that moment there was a noise outside, a man's voice 
crying the name of Thjoden, and the challenge of the guard. 

Presently the captain of the Guard thrust aside the curtain. 'A man is 
here, lord,' he said, 'an errand-rider of Gondor. He wishes to come before 
you at once.' 

'Let him come!' said Thjoden. 

A tall man entered, and Merry choked back a cry; for a moment it seemed 
to him that Boromir was alive again and had returned. Then he saw that it 
was not so; the man was a stranger, though as like to Boromir as if he were 
one of his kin, tall and grey-eyed and proud. He was clad as a rider with a 
cloak of dark green over a coat of fine mail; on the front of his helm was 
wrought a small silver star. In his hand he bore a single arrow, 
black-feathered and barbed with steel, but the point was painted red. 

He sank on one knee and presented the arrow to Thjoden. 'Hail Lord of 
the Rohirrim, friend of Gondor!' he said. 'Hirgon I am, errand-rider of 
Denethor, who bring you this token of war. Gondor is in great need. Often 
the Rohirrim have aided us, but now the Lord Denethor asks for all your 
strength and all your speed; lest Gondor fall at last.' 

'The Red Arrow!' said Thjoden, holding it, as one who receives a 
summons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes. His hand trembled. 
'The Red Arrow has not been seen in the Mark in all my years ! Has it indeed 
come to that? And what does the Lord Denethor reckon that all my strength 
and all my speed may be?' 

'That is best known to yourself, lord,' said Hirgon. 'But ere long it 
may well come to pass that Minas Tirith is surrounded, and unless you have 
the strength to break a siege of many powers, the Lord Denethor bids me say 
that he judges that the strong arms of the Rohirrim would be better within 
his walls than without.' 

'But he knows that we are a people who fight rather upon horseback and 
in the open, and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for 




the gathering of our Riders. Is it not true, Hirgon, that the Lord of Minas 
Tirith knows more than he sets in his message? For we are already at war, as 
you may have seen, and you do not find us all unprepared. Gandalf the Grey 
has been among us, and even now we are mustering for battle in the East.' 

'What the Lord Denethor may know or guess of all these things I cannot 
say,' answered Hirgon. 'But indeed our case is desperate. My lord does not 
issue any command to you, he begs you only to remember old friendship and 
oaths long spoken, and for your own good to do all that you may. It is 
reported to us that many kings have ridden in from the East to the service 
of Mordor. From the North to the field of Dagorlad there is skirmish and 
rumour of war. In the South the Haradrim are moving, and fear has fallen on 
all our coastlands, so that little help will come to us thence. Make haste! 

For it is before the walls of Minas Tirith that the doom of our time will be 
decided, and if the tide be not stemmed there, then it will flow over all 
the fair fields of Rohan, and even in this Hold among the hills there shall 
be no refuge.' 

'Dark tidings,' said Thjoden, 'yet not all unguessed. But say to 
Denethor that even if Rohan itself felt no peril, still we would come to his 
aid. But we have suffered much loss in our battles with Saruman the traitor, 
and we must still think of our frontier to the north and east, as his own 
tidings make clear. So great a power as the Dark Lord seems now to wield 
might well contain us in battle before the City and yet strike with great 
force across the River away beyond the Gate of Kings. 

'But we will speak no longer counsels of prudence. We will come. The 
weapontake was set for the morrow. When all is ordered we will set out. Ten 
thousand spears I might have sent riding over the plain to the dismay of 
your foes. It will be less now, I fear; for I will not leave my strongholds 
all unguarded. Yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me. For say 
to Denethor that in this hour the King of the Mark himself will come down to 
the land of Gondor, though maybe he will not ride back. But it is a long 
road, and man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight. A week it 
may be from tomorrow's morn ere you hear the cry of the Sons of Eorl coming 
from the North. 

'A week!' said Hirgon. 'If it must be so, it must. But you are like to 
find only ruined walls in seven days from now, unless other help 
unlooked-for comes. Still, you may at the least disturb the Ores and Swarthy 
Men from their feasting in the White Tower.' 




'At the least we will do that,' said Thjoden. 'But I myself am new-come 
from battle and long journey, and I will now go to rest. Tarry here this 
night. Then you shall look on the muster of Rohan and ride away the gladder 
for the sight, and the swifter for the rest. In the morning counsels are 
best, and night changes many thoughts. 

With that the king stood up, and they all rose. 'Go now each to your 
rest.' he said, 'and sleep well. And you, Master Meriadoc, I need no more 
tonight. But be ready to my call as soon as the Sun is risen.' 

'I will be ready,' said Merry, 'even if you bid me ride with you on the 
Paths of the Dead.' 

'Speak not words of omen!' said the king. 'For there may be more roads 
than one that could bear that name. But I did not say that I would bid you 
ride with me on any road. Good night!' 

'I won't be left behind, to be called for on return!' said Merry. 'I 
won't be left, I won't.' And repeating this over and over again to himself 
he fell asleep at last in his tent. 

He was wakened by a man shaking him. 'Wake up, wake up. Master 
Holbytla!' he cried; and at length Merry came out of deep dreams and sat up 
with a start. It still seemed very dark, he thought. 

'What is the matter?' he asked. 

'The king calls for you.' 

'But the Sun has not risen, yet,' said Merry. 

'No, and will not rise today, Master Holbytla. Nor ever again, one 
would think under this cloud. But time does not stand still, though the Sun 
be lost. Make haste!' 

Flinging on some clothes, Merry looked outside. The world was darkling. 
The very air seemed brown, and all things about were black and grey and 
shadowless; there was a great stillness. No shape of cloud could be seen, 
unless it were far away westward, where the furthest groping fingers of the 
great gloom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked through them. 
Overhead there hung a heavy roof, sombre and featureless, and light seemed 
rather to be failing than growing. 

Merry saw many folk standing, looking up and muttering: all their faces 
were grey and sad, and some were afraid. With a sinking heart he made his 
way to the king. Hirgon the rider of Gondor was there before him, and beside 
him stood now another man, like him and dressed alike, but shorter and 
broader. As Merry entered he was speaking to the king. 




'It comes from Mordor, lord,' he said. 'It began last night at sunset. 

From the hills in the Eastfold of your realm I saw it rise and creep across 
the sky, and all night as I rode it came behind eating up the stars. Now the 
great cloud hangs over all the land between here and the Mountains of 
Shadow; and it is deepening. War has already begun.' 

For a while the king sat silent. At last he spoke. 'So we come to it in 
the end,' he said: 'the great battle of our time, in which many things shall 
pass away. But at least there is no longer need for hiding. We will ride the 
straight way and the open road and with all our speed. The muster shall 
begin at once, and wait for none that tarry. Have you good store in Minas 
Tirith? For if we must ride now in all haste, then we must ride light, with 
but meal and water enough to last us into battle.' 

'We have very great store long prepared,' answered Hirgon. Ride now as 
light and as swift as you may!' 

'Then call the heralds, Jomer,' said Thjoden. 'Let the Riders be 
marshalled!' 

Jomer went out, and presently the trumpets rang in the Hold and were 
answered by many others from below; but their voices no longer sounded clear 
and brave as they had seemed to Merry the night before. Dull they seemed and 
harsh in the heavy air, braying ominously. 

The king turned to Merry. 'I am going to war, Master Meriadoc,' he 
said. 'In a little while I shall take the road. I release you from my 
service, but not from my friendship. You shall abide here, and if you will, 
you shall serve the Lady Jowyn, who will govern the folk in my stead.' 

'But, but, lord,' Merry stammered, 'I offered you my sword. I do not 
want to be parted from you like this, Thjoden King. And as all my friends 
have gone to the battle' I should be ashamed to stay behind.' 

'But we ride on horses tall and swift,' said Thjoden; 'and great though 
your heart be, you cannot ride on such beasts.' 

'Then tie me on to the back of one, or let me hang on a stirrup, or 
something,' said Merry. 'It is a long way to run; but run I shall, if I 
cannot ride, even if I wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late.' 

Thjoden smiled. 'Rather than that I would bear you with me on 
Snowmane,' he said. 'But at the least you shall ride with me to Edoras and 
look on Meduseld; for that way I shall go. So far Stybba can bear you: the 
great race will not begin till we reach the plains.' 

Then Jowyn rose up. 'Come now, Meriadoc!' she said. 'I will show you 




the gear that I have prepared fur you.' They went out together. 'This 
request only did Aragorn make to me,' said Jowyn, as they passed among the 
tents, 'that you should be armed for battle. I have granted it, as I could. 

For my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.' 

Now she led Merry to a booth among the lodges of the king's guard and 
there an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and a round shield, and 
other gear. 

'No mail have we to fit you,' said Jowyn, 'nor any time for the forging 
of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a 
knife. A sword you have.' 

Merry bowed, and the lady showed him the shield, which was like the 
shield that had been given to Gimli, and it bore on it the device of the 
white horse. 'Take all these things,' she said, 'and bear them to good 
fortune! Farewell now, Master Meriadoc! Yet maybe we shall meet again, you 
and I.' 

So it was that amid a gathering gloom the King of the Mark made ready 
to lead all his Riders on the eastward road. Flearts were heavy and many 
quailed in the shadow. But they were a stern people, loyal to their lord, 
and little weeping or murmuring was heard, even in the camp in the Flold 
where the exiles from Edoras were housed, women and children and old men. 
Doom hung over them, but they faced it silently. 

Two swift hours passed, and now the king sat upon his white horse, 
glimmering in the half light. Proud and tall he seemed, though the hair that 
flowed beneath his high helm was like snow; and many marvelled at him and 
took heart to see him unbent and unafraid. 

There on the wide flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many 
companies well nigh five and fifty hundreds of Riders fully armed, and many 
hundreds of other men with spare horses lightly burdened. A single trumpet 
sounded. The king raised his hand, and then silently the host of the Mark 
began to move. Foremost went twelve of the king's household-men, Riders of 
renown. Then the king followed with Jomer on his right. He had said farewell 
to Jowyn above in the Hold, and the memory was grievous; but now he turned 
his mind to the road that lay ahead. Behind him Merry rode on Stybba with 
the errand riders of Gondor, and behind them again twelve more of the king's 
household. They passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and 
unmoved faces. But when they had come almost to the end of the line one 
looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit. A young man, Merry thought as he 




returned the glance, less in height and girth than most. He caught the glint 
of clear grey eyes; and then he shivered, for it came suddenly to him that 
it was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death. 

On down the grey road they went beside the Snowbourn rushing on its 
stones; through the hamlets of Underharrow and Upbourn, where many sad 
faces 

of women looked out from dark doors; and so without horn or harp or music of 
men's voices the great ride into the East began with which the songs of 
Rohan were busy for many long lives of men thereafter. 

From dark Dunh arrow in the dim morning 
with thane and captain rode Thengel's son: 
to Edoras he came, the ancient halls 
of the Mark-wardens mist-enshrouded; 
golden timbers were in gloom mantled. 

Farewell he bade to his free people, 

hearth and high-seat, and the hallowed places, 

where long he had feasted ere the light faded. 

Forth rode the king, fear behind him, 
fate before him. Fealty kept he; 
oaths he had taken, all fulfilled them. 

Forth rode Thjoden. Five nights and days 
east and onward rode the Eorlingas 
through Folde and Fenmarch and the Firienwood, 
six thousand spears to Sunlending, 

Mundburg the mighty under Mindolluin, 

Sea-kings' city in the South-kingdom 
foe-beleaguered, fire-encircled. 

Doom drove them on. Darkness took them, 

Horse and horseman; hoofbeats afar 
sank into silence: so the songs tell us. 

It was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to Edoras, although 
it was then but noon by the hour. There he halted only a short while and 
strengthened his host by some three score of Riders that came late to the 
weapontake. Now having eaten he made ready to set out again, and he wished 
his esquire a kindly farewell. But Merry begged for the last time not to be 
parted from him. 

This is no journey for such steeds as Stybba, as I have told you ' 




said Thjoden. 'And in such a battle as we think to make on the fields of 
Gondor what would you do, Master Meriadoc, sword-thain though you be, 
and 

greater of heart than of stature?' 

'As for that, who can tell?' answered Merry. 'But why, lord, did you 
receive me as sword-thain, if not to stay by your side? And I would not have 
it said of me in song only that I was always left behind!' 

'I received you for your safe-keeping,' answered Thjoden; 'and also to 
do as I might bid. None of my Riders can bear you as burden. If the battle 
were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the 
minstrels; 

but it is a hundred leagues and two to Mundburg where Denethor is lord. I 
will say no more.' 

Merry bowed and went away unhappily, and stared at the lines of 
horsemen. Already the companies were preparing to start: men were tightening 
girths, looking to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily at 
the lowering sky. Unnoticed a Rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit's 
ear. 

'Where will wants not, a way opens, so we say,' he whispered; 'and so I 
have found myself.' Merry looked up and saw that it was the young Rider 
whom 

he had noticed in the morning. 'You wish to go whither the Lord of the Mark 
goes: I see it in your face.' 

'I do,' said Merry. 

'Then you shall go with me,' said the Rider. 'I will bear you before 
me, under my cloak until we are far afield, and this darkness is yet darker. 

Such good will should not be denied. Say no more to any man, but come!' 

'Thank you indeed!' said Merry. 'Thank you, sir, though I do not know 
your name.' 

'Do you not?' said the Rider softly. 'Then call me Dernhelm.' 

Thus it came to pass that when the king set out, before Dernhelm sat 
Meriadoc the hobbit, and the great grey steed Windfola made little of the 
burden; for Dernhelm was less in weight than many men, though lithe and 
well-knit in frame. 

On into the shadow they rode. In the willow-thickets where Snowbourn 
flowed into Entwash, twelve leagues east of Edoras, they camped that night. 
And then on again through the Folde; and through the Fenmarch, where to 




their right great oakwoods climbed on the skirts of the hills under the 
shades of dark Halifirien by the borders of Gondor; but away to their left 
the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of Entwash. And as they rode 
rumour came of war in the North. Lone men, riding wild, brought word of foes 
assailing their east -borders, of ore-hosts marching in the Wold of Rohan. 

'Ride on! Ride on!' cried Jomer. 'Too late now to turn aside. The fens 
of Entwash must guard our flank. Haste now we need. Ride on!' 

And so King Thjoden departed from his own realm, and mile by mile the 
long road wound away, and the beacon hills marched past: Calenhad, 
Min-Rimmon, Erelas, Nardol. But their fires were quenched. All the lands 
were grey and still; and ever the shadow deepened before them, and hope 
waned in every heart. 




Chapter 4 . The Siege of Gondor 



Pippin was roused by Gandalf. Candles were lit in their chamber, for 
only a dim twilight came through the windows; the air was heavy as with 
approaching thunder. 

’What is the time?' said Pippin yawning. 

’Past the second hour,’ said Gandalf. 'Time to get up and make yourself 
presentable. You are summoned to the Lord of the City to learn your new 
duties.' 

'And will he provide breakfast?' 

'No! I have provided it: all that you will get till noon. Food is now 
doled out by order.' 

Pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and (he thought) very 
inadequate pat of butter which was set out for him, beside a cup of thin 
milk. 'Why did you bring me here?' he said. 

'You know quite well,' said Gandalf. 'To keep you out of mischief; and 
if you do not like being here, you can remember that you brought it on 
yourself.' Pippin said no more. 

Before long he was walking with Gandalf once more down the cold 
corridor to the door of the Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in a grey gloom, 
like an old patient spider, Pippin thought: he did not seem to have moved 
since the day before. He beckoned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for 
a while standing unheeded. Presently the old man turned to him: 

'Well, Master Peregrin, I hope that you used yesterday to your profit, 
and to your liking? Though I fear that the board is barer in this city than 
you could wish.' 

Pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or 
done was somehow known to the Lord of the City, and much was guessed of 
what 

he thought as well. He did not answer. 

'What would you do in my service?' 

'I thought, sir, that you would tell me my duties.' 

'I will, when I learn what you are fit for,' said Denethor. 'But that I 
shall learn soonest, maybe, if I keep you beside me. The esquire of my 
chamber has begged leave to go to the out-garrison, so you shall take his 




place for a while. You shall wait on me, bear errands, and talk to me, if 
war and council leave me any leisure. Can you sing?' 

’Yes,' said Pippin. 'Well, yes, well enough for my own people. But we 
have no songs fit for great halls and evil times, lord. We seldom sing of 
anything more terrible than wind or rain. And most of my songs are about 
things that make us laugh; or about food and drink, of course.' 

’And why should such songs be unfit for my halls, or for such hours as 
these? We who have lived long under the Shadow may surely listen to echoes 
from a land untroubled by it? Then we may feel that our vigil was not 
fruitless, though it may have been thankless.' 

Pippin's heart sank. He did not relish the idea of singing any song of 
the Shire to the Lord of Minas Tirith, certainly not the comic ones that he 
knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an occasion. He was however 
spared the ordeal for the present. He was not commanded to sing. Denethor 
turned to Gandalf, asking questions about the Rohirrim and their policies, 
and the position of Jomer, the king's nephew. Pippin marvelled at the amount 
that the Lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away, though it 
must, he thought, be many years since Denethor himself had ridden abroad. 

Presently Denethor waved to Pippin and dismissed him again for a while. 
'Go to the armouries of the Citadel,' he said, 'and get you there the livery 
and gear of the Tower. It will be ready. It was commanded yesterday. Return 
when you are clad!' 

It was as he said; and Pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange 
garments, all of black and silver. He had a small hauberk, its rings forged 
of steel, maybe, yet black as jet; and a high-crowned helm with small 
raven-wings on either side, set with a silver star in the centre of the 
circlet. Above the mail was a short surcoat of black, but broidered on the 
breast in silver with the token of the Tree. His old clothes were folded and 
put away, but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of Lurien, though not 
to wear it when on duty. He looked now, had he known it, verily Ernil i 
Pheriannath, the Prince of the Halflings, that folk had called him; but he 
felt uncomfortable. And the gloom began to weigh on his spirits. 

It was dark and dim all day. From the sunless dawn until evening the 
heavy shadow had deepened, and all hearts in the City were oppressed. Far 
above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the Black Land, 
devouring 

light, borne upon a wind of war; but below the air was still and breathless, 




as if all the Vale of Anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm. 

About the eleventh hour, released at last for a while from service. 

Pippin came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy 
heart and make his task of waiting more supportable. In the messes he met 
Beregond again, who had just come from an errand over the Pelennor out to 
the Guard-towers upon the Causeway. Together they strolled out to the walls; 
for Pippin felt imprisoned indoors, and stifled even in the lofty citadel. 

Now they sat side by side again in the embrasure looking eastward, where 
they had eaten and talked the day before. 

It was the sunset-hour, but the great pall had now stretched far into 
the West, and only as it sank at last into the Sea did the Sun escape to 
send out a brief farewell gleam before the night, even as Frodo saw it at 
the Cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king. But to the fields of 
the Pelennor, under the shadow of Mindolluin, there came no gleam: they were 
brown and drear. 

Already it seemed years to Pippin since he had sat there before, in 
some half-forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit, a light-hearted 
wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through. Now he was one 
small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault, clad in the proud but 
sombre manner of the Tower of Guard. 

In some other time and place Pippin might have been pleased with his 
new array, but he knew now that he was taking part in no play; he was in 
deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril. The 
hauberk was burdensome, and the helm weighed upon his head. His cloak he 
had 

cast aside upon the seat. He turned his tired gaze away from the darkling 
fields below and yawned, and then he sighed. 

'You are weary of this day?' said Beregond. 

'Yes,' said Pippin, ’very: tired out with idleness and waiting. I have 
kicked my heels at the door of my master's chamber for many slow hours, 
while he has debated with Gandalf and the Prince and other great persons. 
And I'm not used, Master Beregond, to waiting hungry on others while they 
eat. It is a sore trial for a hobbit, that. No doubt you will think I should 
feel the honour more deeply. But what is the good of such honour? Indeed 
what is the good even of food and drink under this creeping shadow? What 
does it mean? The very air seems thick and brown! Do you often have such 
glooms when the wind is in the East?' 




'Nay,' said Beregond, 'this is no weather of the world. This is some 
device of his malice; some broil of fume from the Mountain of Fire that he 
sends to darken hearts and counsel. And so it doth indeed. I wish the Lord 
Faramir would return. Fie would not be dismayed. But now, who knows if he 
will ever come back across the River out of the Darkness?' 

'Yes,' said Pippin, 'Gandalf, too, is anxious. He was disappointed. I 
think, not to find Faramir here. And where has he got to himself? He left 
the Lord's council before the noon-meal, and in no good mood either, I 
thought. Perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news.' 

Suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb, frozen as it were to 
listening stones. Pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; 
but Beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of 
Faramir, remained there, stiffened, staring out with starting eyes. Pippin 
knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard 
long ago in the Marish of the Shire, but now it was grown in power and 
hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair. 

At last Beregond spoke with an effort. 'They have come!' he said. 'Take 
courage and look! There are fell things below.' 

Reluctantly Pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. 

The Pelennor lay dim beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of 
the Great River. But now wheeling swiftly across it, like shadows of 
untimely night, he saw in the middle airs below him five birdlike forms, 
horrible as carrion-fowl yet greater than eagles, cruel as death. Now they 
swooped near, venturing almost within bowshot of the walls, now they circled 
away. 

'Black Riders!' muttered Pippin. 'Black Riders of the air! But see, 
Beregond!' he cried. 'They are looking for something, surely? See how they 
wheel and swoop, always down to that point over there! And can you see 
something moving on the ground? Dark little things. Yes, men on horses: four 
or five. Ah! I cannot stand it! Gandalf! Gandalf save us!' 

Another long screech rose and fell, and he threw himself back again 
from the wall, panting like a hunted animal. Faint and seemingly remote 
through that shuddering cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a 
trumpet ending on a long high note. 

'Faramir! The Lord Faramir! It is his call!' cried Beregond. 'Brave 
heart! But how can he win to the Gate, if these foul hell -hawks have other 
weapons than fear? But look! They hold on. They will make the Gate. No! the 




horses are running mad. Look! the men are thrown; they are running on foot. 
No, one is still up, but he rides back to the others. That will be the 
Captain: he can master both beasts and men. Ah! there one of the foul things 
is stooping on him. Help! help! Will no one go out to him? Faramir!' 

With that Beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom. Ashamed of 
his terror, while Beregond of the Guard thought first of the captain whom he 
loved, Pippin got up and peered out. At that moment he caught a flash of 
white and silver coming from the North, like a small star down on the dusky 
fields. It moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came, converging 
swiftly with the flight of the four men towards the Gate. It seemed to 
Pippin that a pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way 
before it; and then as it drew near he thought that he heard, like an echo 
in the walls, a great voice calling. 

’Gandalf!’ he cried. 'Gandalf! He always turns up when things are 
darkest. Go on! Go on, White Rider! Gandalf, Gandalf!’ he shouted wildly, 
like an onlooker at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond 
encouragement. 

But now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer. One 
wheeled towards him; but it seemed to Pippin that he raised his hand, and 
from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards. The Nazgyl gave a long 
wailing cry and swerved away; and with that the four others wavered, and 
then rising in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the 
lowering cloud above; and down on the Pelennor it seemed for a while less 
dark. 

Pippin watched, and he saw the horseman and the White Rider meet and 
halt, waiting for those on foot. Men now hurried out to them from the City; 
and soon they all passed from sight under the outer walls, and he knew that 
they were entering the Gate. Guessing that they would come at once to the 
Tower and the Steward, he hurried to the entrance of the citadel. There he 
was joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the 
high walls. 

It was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up 
from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names 
of Faramir and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw torches, and followed by a 
press of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no 
longer, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other 
was dark and his head was bowed. They dismounted, and as grooms took 




Shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the 
gate: Gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still 
smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a 
little as a weary or a wounded man. 

Pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the 
gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath. It 
was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but 
has mastered it and now is quiet. Proud and grave he stood for a moment as 
he spoke to the guard, and Pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled 
his brother Boromir - whom Pippin had liked from the first, admiring the 
great man's lordly but kindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was 
strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. Flere was one 
with an air of high nobility such as Aragorn at times revealed, less high 
perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born 
into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the Elder 
Race. He knew now why Beregond spoke his name with love. He was a 
captain 

that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the 
black wings. 

'Faramir!' he cried aloud with the others. 'Faramir!' And Faramir 
catching his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the City, turned 
and looked down at him and was amazed. 

'Whence come you?' he said. 'A halfling, and in the livery of the 
Tower! Whence...?' 

But with that Gandalf stepped to his side and spoke. 'He came with me 
from the land of the Halflings,' he said. 'He came with me. But let us not 
tarry here. There is much to say and to do, and you are weary. He shall come 
with us. Indeed he must, for if he does not forget his new duties more 
easily than I do, he must attend on his lord again within this hour. Come, 
Pippin, follow us!' 

So at length they came to the private chamber of the Lord of the City. 
There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; 
and there Pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of Denethor and 
felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. 

When Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat 
upon a low chair at his father's left hand. Removed a little upon the other 
side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and he seemed at first to be 




asleep. For at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he 
had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of 
movements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road 
when the men of Harad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain 
reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small 
things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their 
renown. 

Then suddenly Faramir looked at Pippin. 'But now we come to strange 
matters,' he said. 'For this is not the first halfling that I have seen 
walking out of northern legends into the Southlands.' 

At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said 
nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor 
looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had 
read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent 
and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on 
Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh 
his memory of others that he had seen. 

As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and 
of the events at Henneth Annyn, Pippin became aware that Gandalf s hands 
were trembling as they clutched the carven wood. White they seemed now 
and 

very old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin 
knew that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid. The air of 
the room was close and still. At last when Faramir spoke of his parting with 
the travellers, and of their resolve to go to Cirith Ungol, his voice fell, 
and he shook his head and sighed. Then Gandalf sprang up. 

'Cirith Ungol? Morgul Vale?' he said. 'The time, Faramir, the time? 
When did you part with them? When would they reach that accursed valley?' 

'I parted with them in the morning two days ago,' said Faramir. 'It is 
fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the Morgulduin, if they went straight 
south; and then they would be still five leagues westward of the accursed 
Tower. At swiftest they could not come there before today, and maybe they 
have not come there yet. Indeed I see what you fear. But the darkness is not 
due to their venture. It began yestereve, and all Ithilien was under shadow 
last night. It is clear to me that the Enemy has long planned an assault on 
us, and its hour had already been determined before ever the travellers left 
my keeping.' 




Gandalf paced the floor. The morning of two days ago, nigh on three 
days of journey! How far is the place where you parted?' 

’Some twenty-five leagues as a bird flies,' answered Faramir. 'But I 
could not come more swiftly. Yestereve I lay at Cair Andros, the long isle 
in the River northward which we hold in defence; and horses are kept on the 
hither bank. As the dark drew on I knew that haste was needed, so I rode 
thence with three others that could also be horsed. The rest of my company I 
sent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of Osgiliath. I hope that 
I have not done ill?' He looked at his father. 

'111?' cried Denethor, and his eyes flashed suddenly. 'Why do you ask? 

The men were under your command. Or do you ask for my judgement on all 
your 

deeds? Your bearing is lowly in my presence, yet it is long now since you 
turned from your own way at my counsel. See, you have spoken skilfully, as 
ever; but I, have I not seen your eye fixed on Mithrandir, seeking whether 
you said well or too much? He has long had your heart in his keeping. 

'My son, your father is old but not yet dotard. I can see and hear, as 
was my wont; and little of what you have half said or left unsaid is now 
hidden from me. I know the answer to many riddles. Alas, alas for Boromir!' 

'If what I have done displeases you, my father,' said Faramir quietly, 

'I wish I had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement 
was thrust on me.' 

'Would that have availed to change your judgement?' said Denethor. 'You 
would still have done just so, I deem. I know you well. Ever your desire is 
to appear lordly and generous as a king of old, gracious, gentle. That may 
well befit one of high race, if he sits in power and peace. But in desperate 
hours gentleness may be repaid with death.' 

'So be it,' said Faramir. 

'So be it!' cried Denethor. 'But not with your death only, Lord 
Faramir: with the death also of your father, and of all your people, whom it 
is your part to protect now that Boromir is gone.' 

'Do you wish then,' said Faramir, 'that our places had been exchanged?' 

'Yes, I wish that indeed,' said Denethor. 'For Boromir was loyal to me 
and no wizard's pupil. He would have remembered his father's need, and would 
not have squandered what fortune gave. He would have brought me a mighty 
gift.' 

For a moment Faramir's restraint gave way. 'I would ask you, my father, 




to remember why it was that I, not he, was in Ithilien. On one occasion at 
least your counsel has prevailed, not long ago. It was the Lord of the City 
that gave the errand to him.' 

'Stir not the bitterness in the cup that I mixed for myself,' said 
Denethor. 'Have I not tasted it now many nights upon my tongue foreboding 
that worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find. Would it were not so! 
Would that this thing had come to me!' 

'Comfort yourself!' said Gandalf. 'In no case would Boromir have 
brought it to you. He is dead, and died well; may he sleep in peace! Yet you 
deceive yourself. He would have stretched out his hand to this thing, and 
taking it he would have fallen. He would have kept it for his own, and when 
he returned you would not have known your son.' 

The face of Denethor set hard and cold. 'You found Boromir less apt to 
your hand, did you not?' he said softly. 'But I who was his father say that 
he would have brought it to me. You are wise, maybe, Mithrandir, yet with 
all your subtleties you have not all wisdom. Counsels may be found that are 
neither the webs of wizards nor the haste of fools. I have in this matter 
more lore and wisdom than you deem. ' 

'What then is your wisdom?' said Gandalf. 

'Enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid. To use this 
thing is perilous. At this hour, to send it in the hands of a witless 
halfling into the land of the Enemy himself, as you have done, and this son 
of mine, that is madness.' 

'And the Lord Denethor what would he have done?' 

'Neither. But most surely not for any argument would he have set this 
thing at a hazard beyond all but a fool's hope, risking our utter ruin, if 
the Enemy should recover what he lost. Nay, it should have been kept, 
hidden, hidden dark and deep. Not used, I say, unless at the uttermost end 
of need, but set beyond his grasp, save by a victory so final that what then 
befell would not trouble us, being dead.' 

'You think, as is your wont, my lord, of Gondor only,' said Gandalf. 

'Yet there are other men and other lives, and time still to be. And for me, 

I pity even his slaves.' 

'And where will other men look for help, if Gondor falls?' answered 
Denethor. 'If I had this thing now in the deep vaults of this citadel, we 
should not then shake with dread under this gloom, fearing the worst, and 
our counsels would be undisturbed. If you do not trust me to endure the 




test, you do not know me yet.' 

'Nonetheless I do not trust you,' said Gandalf. 'Had I done so, I could 
have sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself and others 
much anguish. And now hearing you speak I trust you less, no more than 
Boromir. Nay, stay your wrath! I do not trust myself in this, and I refused 
this thing, even as a freely given gift. You are strong and can still in 
some matters govern yourself, Denethor; yet if you had received this thing, 
it would have overthrown you. Were it buried beneath the roots of 
Mindolluin, still it would burn your mind away, as the darkness grows, and 
the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us.' 

For a moment the eyes of Denethor glowed again as he faced Gandalf, and 
Pippin felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it 
seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flickering as 
they fenced. Pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke. But suddenly 
Denethor relaxed and grew cold again. He shrugged his shoulders. 

'If I had! If you had!' he said. 'Such words and ifs are vain. It has 
gone into the Shadow, and only time will show what doom awaits it and us. 
The time will not be long. In what is left, let all who fight the Enemy in 
their fashion be at one, and keep hope while they may, and after hope still 
the hardihood to die free.' He turned to Faramir. 'What think you of the 
garrison at Osgiliath?' 

'It is not strong,' said Faramir. 'I have sent the company of Ithilien 
to strengthen it, as I have said.' 

'Not enough, I deem,' said Denethor. 'It is there that the first blow 
will fall. They will have need of some stout captain there.' 

'There and elsewhere in many places,' said Faramir, and sighed. 'Alas 
for my brother, whom I too loved!' He rose. 'May I have your leave, father?' 
And then he swayed and leaned upon his father's chair. 

'You are weary, I see,' said Denethor. 'You have ridden fast and far, 
and under shadows of evil in the air, I am told.' 

'Let us not speak of that!' said Faramir. 

'Then we will not,' said Denethor. 'Go now and rest as you may. 
Tomorrow's need will be sterner.' 

All now took leave of the Lord of the City and went to rest while they 
still could. Outside there was a starless blackness as Gandalf with Pippin 
beside him bearing a small torch, made his way to their lodging. They did 
not speak until they were behind closed doors. Then at last Pippin took 




Gandalf s hand. 

Tell me,' he said, 'is there any hope? For Frodo, I mean; or at least 
mostly for Frodo.' 

Gandalf put his hand on Pippin's head. 'There never was much hope,' he 
answered. 'Just a fool's hope, as I have been told. And when I heard of 

Cirith Ungol ' He broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes 

could pierce the night in the East. 'Cirith Ungol!' he muttered. 'Why that 
way, I wonder?' He turned. 'Just now, Pippin, my heart almost failed me, 
hearing that name. And yet in truth I believe that the news that Faramir 
brings has some hope in it. For it seems clear that our Enemy has opened his 
war at last and made the first move while Frodo was still free. So now for 
many days he will have his eye turned this way and that, away from his own 
land. And yet, Pippin, I feel from afar his haste and fear. He has begun 
sooner than he would. Something has happened to stir him.' 

Gandalf stood for a moment in thought. 'Maybe,' he muttered. 'Maybe 
even your foolishness helped, my lad. Let me see: some five days ago now he 
would discover that we had thrown down Saruman and had taken the Stone. 
Still what of that? We could not use it to much purpose, or without his 
knowing. Ah! I wonder. Aragorn? His time draws near. And he is strong and 
stern underneath, Pippin; bold, determined, able to take his own counsel and 
dare great risks at need. That may be it. He may have used the Stone and 
shown himself to the Enemy, challenging him, for this very purpose. I 
wonder. Well, we shall not know the answer till the Riders of Rohan come, if 
they do not come too late. There are evil days ahead. To sleep while we 
may!' 

'But,' said Pippin. 

'But what?' said Gandalf. 'Only one but will I allow tonight.' 

'Gollum,' said Pippin. 'How on earth could they be going about with 
him, even following him? And I could see that Faramir did not like the place 
he was taking them to any more than you do. What is wrong?' 

'I cannot answer that now,' said Gandalf. 'Yet my heart guessed that 
Frodo and Gollum would meet before the end. For good, or for evil. But of 
Cirith Ungol I will not speak tonight. Treachery, treachery I fear; 
treachery of that miserable creature. But so it must be. Let us remember 
that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does not intend. It 
can be so, sometimes. Good night! ' 

The next day came with a morning like a brown dusk, and the hearts of 




men, lifted for a while by the return of Faramir, sank low again. The winged 
Shadows were not seen again that day, yet ever and anon, high above the 
city, a faint cry would come, and many who heard it would stand stricken 
with a passing dread, while the less stout-hearted quailed and wept. 

And now Faramir was gone again. 'They give him no rest,' some murmured. 
'The Lord drives his son too hard, and now he must do the duty of two, for 
himself and for the one that will not return.' And ever men looked 
northward, asking: 'Where are the Riders of Rohan?' 

In truth Faramir did not go by his own choosing. But the Lord of the 
City was master of his Council, and he was in no mood that day to bow to 
others. Early in the morning the Council had been summoned. There all the 
captains judged that because of the threat in the South their force was too 
weak to make any stroke of war on their own part, unless perchance the 
Riders of Rohan yet should come. Meanwhile they must man the walls and 
wait. 

'Yet,' said Denethor, 'we should not lightly abandon the outer 
defences, the Rammas made with so great a labour. And the Enemy must 
pay 

dearly for the crossing of the River. That he cannot do, in force to assail 
the City, either north of Cair Andros because of the marshes, or southwards 
towards Lebennin because of the breadth of the River, that needs many boats. 

It is at Osgiliath that he will put his weight, as before when Boromir 
denied him the passage.' 

'That was but a trial,' said Faramir. 'Today we may make the Enemy pay 
ten times our loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange. For he can 
afford to lose a host better than we to lose a company. And the retreat of 
those that we put out far afield will be perilous, if he wins across in 
force.' 

'And what of Cair Andros?' said the Prince. 'That, too, must be held, 
if Osgiliath is defended. Let us not forget the danger on our left. The 
Rohirrim may come, and they may not. But Faramir has told us of great 
strength drawing ever to the Black Gate. More than one host may issue from 
it, and strike for more than one passage.' 

'Much must be risked in war,' said Denethor. 'Cair Andros is manned and 
no more can be sent so far. But I will not yield the River and the Pelennor 
unfought - not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do 
his lord's will.' 




Then all were silent, but at length Faramir said: 'I do not oppose your 
will, sire. Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will go and do what I can in 
his stead - if you command it.' 

'I do so,' said Denethor. 

Then farewell!' said Faramir. 'But if I should return, think better of 
me!' 

'That depends on the manner of your return,' said Denethor. 

Gandalf it was that last spoke to Faramir ere he rode east. 'Do not 
throw your live away rashly or in bitterness,' he said. 'You will be needed 
here, for other things than war. Your father loves you, Faramir, and will 
remember it ere the end. Farewell!' 

So now the Lord Faramir had gone forth again, and had taken with him 
such strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared. On the walls 
some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city, and they wondered 
what 

chanced there, for nothing could be seen. And others, as ever, looked north 
and counted the leagues to Thjoden in Rohan. 'Will he come? Will he 
remember 

our old alliance?' they said. 

'Yes, he will come,' said Gandalf, 'even if he comes too late. But 
think! At best the Red Arrow cannot have reached him more than two days 
ago, 

and the miles are long from Edoras.' 

It was night again ere news came. A man rode in haste from the fords, 
saying that a host had issued from Minas Morgul and was already drawing nigh 
to Osgiliath; and it had been joined by regiments from the South, Haradrim, 
cruel and tall. 'And we have learned ' said the messenger, 'that the Black 
Captain leads them once again, and the fear of him has passed before him 
over the River.' 

With those ill-boding words the third day closed since Pippin came to 
Minas Tirith. Few went to rest, for small hope had any now that even Faramir 
could hold the fords for long. 

The next day, though the darkness had reached its full and grew no 
deeper, it weighed heavier on men's hearts, and a great dread was on them. 

Ill news came soon again. The passage of Anduin was won by the Enemy. 
Faramir was retreating to the wall of the Pelennor, rallying his men to the 
Causeway Forts; but he was ten times outnumbered. 




'If he wins back at all across the Pelennor, his enemies will be on his 
heels,' said the messenger. 'They have paid dear for the crossing but less 
dearly than we hoped. The plan has been well laid. It is now seen that in 
secret they have long been building floats and barges in great numbers in 
East Osgiliath. They swarmed across like beetles. But it is the Black 
Captain that defeats us. Few will stand and abide even the rumour of his 
coming. His own folk quail at him, and they would slay themselves at his 
bidding.' 

'Then I am needed there more than here,' said Gandalf, and rode off at 
once, and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight. And all that night 
Pippin alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward. 

The bells of day had scarcely rung out again, a mockery in the 
unlightened dark, when far away he saw fires spring up, across in the dim 
spaces where the walls of the Pelennor stood. The watchmen cried aloud, and 
all men in the City stood to arms. Now ever and anon there was a red flash, 
and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard. 

'They have taken the wall!' men cried. 'They are blasting breaches in 
it. They are coming!' 

'Where is Faramir?' cried Beregond in dismay. 'Say not that he has 
fallen!' 

It was Gandalf that brought the first tidings. With a handful of 
horsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line of wains. 
They were filled with wounded men, all that could be saved from the wreck of 
the Causeway Forts. At once he went to Denethor. The Ford of the City sat 
now in a high chamber above the Hall of the White Tower with Pippin at his 
side; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he bent his 
dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round. Most 
to the north he looked, and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some 
ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away. 

'Is Faramir come?' he asked. 

'No,' said Gandalf. 'But he still lived when I left him. Yet he is 
resolved to stay with the rearguard, lest the retreat over the Pelennor 
become a rout. He may, perhaps, hold his men together long enough, but I 
doubt it. He is pitted against a foe too great. For one has come that I 
feared.' 

'Not - the Dark Ford?' cried Pippin, forgetting his place in his 
terror. 




Denethor laughed bitterly. 'Nay, not yet, Master Peregrin! He will not 
come save only to triumph over me when all is won. He uses others as his 
weapons. So do all great lords, if they are wise, Master Halfling. Or why 
should I sit here in my tower and think, and watch, and wait, spending even 
my sons? For I can still wield a brand.' 

He stood up and cast open his long black cloak, and behold! he was clad 
in mail beneath, and girt with a long sword, great-hilted in a sheath of 
black and silver. 'Thus have I walked, and thus now for many years have I 
slept,' he said, 'lest with age the body should grow soft and timid.' 

'Yet now under the Lord of Barad-dyr the most fell of all his captains 
is already master of your outer walls,' said Gandalf. 'King of Angmar long 
ago, Sorcerer, Ringwraith, Lord of the Nazgyl, a spear of terror in the hand 
of Sauron, shadow of despair.' 

'Then, Mithrandir, you had a foe to match you,' said Denethor. 'For 
myself, I have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the Dark 
Tower. Is this all that you have returned to say? Or can it be that you have 
withdrawn because you are overmatched?' 

Pippin trembled, fearing that Gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath, 
but his fear was needless. 'It might be so,' Gandalf answered softly. 'But 
our trial of strength is not yet come. And if words spoken of old be true, 
not by the hand of man shall he fall, and hidden from the Wise is the doom 
that awaits him. However that may be, the Captain of Despair does not press 
forward, yet. He rules rather according to the wisdom that you have just 
spoken, from the rear, driving his slaves in madness on before. 

'Nay, I came rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be healed; for 
the Rammas is breached far and wide, and soon the host of Morgul will enter 
in at many points. And I came chiefly to say this. Soon there will be battle 
on the fields. A sortie must be made ready. Let it be of mounted men. In 
them lies our brief hope, for in one thing only is the enemy still poorly 
provided: he has few horsemen.' 

'And we also have few. Now would the coming of Rohan be in the nick of 
time,' said Denethor. 

'We are likely to see other newcomers first,' said Gandalf. 'Fugitives 
from Cair Andros have already reached us. The isle has fallen. Another army 
is come from the Black Gate, crossing from the north-east.' 

'Some have accused you, Mithrandir, of delighting to bear ill news,' 
said Denethor, 'but to me this is no longer news: it was known to mw ere 




nightfall yesterday. As for the sortie, I had already given thought to it. 

Let us go down.' 

Time passed. At length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of 
the out-companies. Small bands of weary and often wounded men came first 
with little order; some were running wildly as if pursued. Away to the 
eastward the distant fires flickered; and now it seemed that here and there 
they crept across the plain. Houses and barns were burning. Then from many 
points little rivers of red flame came hurrying on, winding through the 
gloom, converging towards the line of the broad road that led from the 
City-gate to Osgiliath. 

'The enemy,' men murmured. 'The dike is down. Here they come pouring 
through the breaches! And they carry torches, it seems. Where are our own 
folk?' 

It drew now to evening by the hour, and the light was so dim that even 
far-sighted men upon the Citadel could discern little clearly out upon the 
fields, save only the burnings that ever multiplied, and the lines of fire 
that grew in length and speed. At last, less than a mile from the City, a 
more ordered mass of men came into view, marching not running, still holding 
together. 

The watchers held their breath. 'Faramir must be there,' they said. 'He 
can govern man and beast. He will make it yet.' 

Now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant. Out of the 
gloom behind a small company of horsemen galloped, all that was left of the 
rearguard. Once again they turned at bay, facing the oncoming lines of fire. 
Then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cries. Horsemen of the enemy 
swept up. The lines of fire became flowing torrents, file upon file of Ores 
bearing flames, and wild Southron men with red banners, shouting with harsh 
tongues, surging up, overtaking the retreat. And with a piercing cry out of 
the dim sky fell the winged shadows, the Nazgyl stooping to the kill. 

The retreat became a rout. Already men were breaking away, flying wild 
and witless here and there, flinging away their weapons, crying out in fear, 
falling to the ground. 

And then a trumpet rang from the Citadel, and Denethor at last released 
the sortie. Drawn up within the shadow of the Gate and under the looming 
walls outside they had waited for his signal: all the mounted men that were 
left in the City. Now they sprang forward, formed, quickened to a gallop, 
and charged with a great shout. And from the walls an answering shout went 




up; for foremost on the field rode the swan-knights of Dol Amroth with their 
Prince and his blue banner at their head. 

'Amroth for Gondor!' they cried. ’Amroth to Faramir!' 

Like thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat; 
but one rider outran them all, swift as the wind in the grass: Shadowfax 
bore him, shining, unveiled once more, a light starting from his upraised 
hand. 

The Nazgyl screeched and swept away, for their Captain was not yet come 
to challenge the white fire of his foe. The hosts of Morgul intent on their 
prey, taken at unawares in wild career, broke, scattering like sparks in a 
gale. The out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers. 
Hunters became the hunted. The retreat became an onslaught. The field was 
strewn with stricken ores and men, and a reek arose of torches cast away, 
sputtering out in swirling smoke. The cavalry rode on. 

But Denethor did not permit them to go far. Though the enemy was 
checked, and for the moment driven back, great forces were flowing in from 
the East. Again the trumpet rang, sounding the retreat. The cavalry of 
Gondor halted. Behind their screen the out-companies re-formed. Now steadily 
they came marching back. They reached the Gate of the City and entered, 
stepping proudly: and proudly the people of the City looked on them and 
cried their praise, and yet they were troubled in heart. For the companies 
were grievously reduced. Faramir had lost a third of his men. And where was 
he? 

Last of all he came. His men passed in. The mounted knights returned, 
and at their rear the banner of Dol Amroth, and the Prince. And in his arms 
before him on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman, Faramir son of 
Denethor, found upon the stricken field. 

'Faramir! Faramir!' men cried, weeping in the streets. But he did not 
answer, and they bore him away up the winding road to the Citadel and his 
father. Even as the Nazgyl had swerved aside from the onset of the White 
Rider, there came flying a deadly dart, and Faramir, as he held at bay a 
mounted champion of Harad, had fallen to the earth. Only the charge of Dol 
Amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed 
him 

as he lay. 

The Prince Imrahil brought Faramir to the White Tower, and he said: 
Your son has returned, lord, after great deeds, and he told all that he had 




seen. But Denethor rose and looked on the face of his son and was silent. 

Then he bade them make a bed in the chamber and lay Faramir upon it and 
depart. But he himself went up alone into the secret room under the summit 
of the Tower; and many who looked up thither at that time saw a pale light 
that gleamed and flickered from the narrow windows for a while, and then 
flashed and went out. And when Denethor descended again he went to 
Faramir 

and sat beside him without speaking, but the face of the Lord was grey, more 
deathlike than his son's. 

So now at last the City was besieged, enclosed in a ring of foes. The 
Rammas was broken, and all the Pelennor abandoned to the Enemy. The last 
word to come from outside the walls was brought by men flying down the 
northward road ere the Gate was shut. They were the remnant of the guard 
that was kept at that point where the way from Anurien and Rohan ran into 
the townlands: Ingold led them, the same who had admitted Gandalf and Pippin 
less than five days before, while the sun still rose and there was hope in 
the morning. 

There is no news of the Rohirrim,' he said. ’Rohan will not come now. 

Or if they come, it will not avail us. The new host that we had tidings of 
has come first, from over the River by way of Andros, it is said. They are 
strong: battalions of Ores of the Eye, and countless companies of Men of a 
new sort that we have not met before. Not tall, but broad and grim, bearded 
like dwarves, wielding great axes. Out of some savage land in the wide East 
they come, we deem. They hold the northward road; and many have passed 
on 

into Anurien. The Rohirrim cannot come.' 

The Gate was shut. All night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of 
the enemy that roamed outside, burning field and tree, and hewing any man 
that they found abroad, living or dead. The numbers that had already passed 
over the River could not be guessed in the darkness, but when morning, or 
its dim shadow, stole over the plain, it was seen that even fear by night 
had scarcely over-counted them. The plain was dark with their marching 
companies, and as far as eyes could strain in the mirk there sprouted, like 
a foul fungus-growth, all about the beleaguered city great camps of tents, 
black or sombre red. 

Busy as ants hurrying ores were digging, digging lines of deep trenches 
in a huge ring, just out of bowshot from the walls; and as the trenches were 




made each was filled with fire, though how it was kindled or fed, by art or 
devilry, none could see. All day the labour went forward, while the men of 
Minas Tirith looked on, unable to hinder it. And as each length of trench 
was completed, they could see great wains approaching; and soon yet more 
companies of the enemy were swiftly setting up, each behind the cover of a 
trench, great engines for the casting of missiles. There were none upon the 
City walls large enough to reach so far or to stay the work. 

At first men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices. For the 
main wall of the City was of great height and marvellous thickness, built 
ere the power and craft of N®menor waned in exile; and its outward face was 
like to the Tower of Orthanc, hard and dark and smooth, unconquerable by 
steel or fire, unbreakable except by some convulsion that would rend the 
very earth on which it stood. 

'Nay,' they said, 'not if the Nameless One himself should come, not 
even he could enter here while we yet live.' But some answered: 'While we 
yet live? How long? He has a weapon that has brought low many strong places 
since the world began. Hunger. The roads are cut. Rohan will not come.' 

But the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall. It was no 
brigand or ore-chieftain that ordered the assault upon the Lord of Mordor's 
greatest foe. A power and mind of malice guided it. As soon as the great 
catapults were set, with many yells and the creaking of rope and winch, they 
began to throw missiles marvellously high, so that they passed right above 
the battlement and fell thudding within the first circle of the City; and 
many of them by some secret art burst into flame as they came toppling down. 

Soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall, and all who could 
be spared were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many places. Then 
among the greater casts there fell another hail, less ruinous but more 
horrible. All about the streets and lanes behind the Gate it tumbled down, 
small round shot that did not burn. But when men ran to learn what it might 
be, they cried aloud or wept. For the enemy was flinging into the City all 
the heads of those who had fallen fighting at Osgiliath, or on the Rammas, 
or in the fields. They were grim to look on; for though some were crushed 
and shapeless, and some had been cruelly hewn, yet many had features that 
could be told, and it seemed that they had died in pain; and all were 
branded with the foul token of the Lidless Eye. But marred and dishonoured 
as they were, it often chanced that thus a man would see again the face of 
someone that he had known, who had walked proudly once in arms, or tilled 




the fields, or ridden in upon a holiday from the green vales in the hills. 

In vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before 
the Gate. Curses they heeded not, nor understood the tongues of western men; 
crying with harsh voices like beasts and carrion-birds. But soon there were 
few left in Minas Tirith who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of 
Mordor. For yet another weapon, swifter than hunger, the Lord of the Dark 
Tower had: dread and despair. 

The Nazgyl came again, and as their Dark Lord now grew and put forth 
his strength, so their voices, which uttered only his will and his malice, 
were filled with evil and horror. Ever they circled above the City, like 
vultures that expect their fill of doomed men’s flesh. Out of sight and shot 
they flew, and yet were ever present, and their deadly voices rent the air. 

More unbearable they became, not less, at each new cry. At length even the 
stout-hearted would fling themselves to the ground as the hidden menace 
passed over them, or they would stand, letting their weapons fall from 
nerveless hands while into their minds a blackness came, and they thought no 
more of war, but only of hiding and of crawling, and of death. 

During all this black day Faramir lay upon his bed in the chamber of 
the White Tower, wandering in a desperate fever; dying someone said, and 
soon ’dying’ all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets. And by 
him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave no longer any 
heed to the defence. 

No hours so dark had Pippin known, not even in the clutches of the 
Uruk-hai. It was his duty to wait upon the Lord, and wait he did, forgotten 
it seemed, standing by the door of the unlit chamber, mastering his own 
fears as best he could. And as he watched, it seemed to him that Denethor 
grew old before his eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and 
his stern mind was overthrown. Grief maybe had wrought it, and remorse. He 
saw tears on that once tearless face, more unbearable than wrath. 

'Do not weep, lord,’ he stammered. ’Perhaps he will get well. Have you 
asked Gandalf?' 

'Comfort me not with wizards!' said Denethor. 'The fool's hope has 
failed. The Enemy has found it, and now his power waxes; he sees our very 
thoughts, and all we do is ruinous. 

'I sent my son forth, unthanked, unblessed, out into needless peril, 
and here he lies with poison in his veins. Nay, nay, whatever may now betide 
in war, my line too is ending, even the House of the Stewards has failed. 




Mean folk shall rule the last remnant of the Kings of Men, lurking in the 
hills until all are hounded out.' 

Men came to the door crying for the Lord of the City. 'Nay, I will not 
come down,' he said. 'I must stay beside my son. He might still speak before 
the end. But that is near. Follow whom you will, even the Grey Fool, though 
his hope has failed. Here I stay.' 

So it was that Gandalf took command of the last defence of the City of 
Gondor. Wherever he came men's hearts would lift again, and the winged 
shadows pass from memory. Tirelessly he strode from Citadel to Gate, from 
north to south about the wall; and with him went the Prince of Dol Amroth in 
his shining mail. For he and his knights still held themselves like lords in 
whom the race ofN®menor ran true. Men that saw them whispered saying: 
'Belike the old tales speak well; there is Elvish blood in the veins of that 
folk, for the people of Nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago.' And then 
one would sing amid the gloom some staves of the Lay of Nimrodel, or other 
songs of the Vale of Anduin out of vanished years. 

And yet - when they had gone, the shadows closed on men again, and 
their hearts went cold, and the valour of Gondor withered into ash. And so 
slowly they passed out of a dim day of fears into the darkness of a 
desperate night. Fires now raged unchecked in the first circle of the City, 
and the garrison upon the outer wall was already in many places cut off from 
retreat. But the faithful who remained there at their posts were few; most 
had fled beyond the second gate. 

Far behind the battle the River had been swiftly bridged, and all day 
more force and gear of war had poured across. Now at last in the middle 
night the assault was loosed. The vanguard passed through the trenches of 
fire by many devious paths that had been left between them. On they came, 
reckless of their loss as they approached, still bunched and herded, within 
the range of bowmen on the wall. But indeed there were too few now left 
there to do them great damage, though the light of the fires showed up many 
a mark for archers of such skill as Gondor once had boasted. Then perceiving 
that the valour of the City was already beaten down, the hidden Captain put 
forth his strength. Slowly the great siege-towers built in Osgiliath rolled 
forward through the dark. 

Messengers came again to the chamber in the White Tower, and Pippin let 
them enter, for they were urgent. Denethor turned his head slowly from 
Faramir's face, and looked at them silently. 




'The first circle of the City is burning, lord,' they said. ’What are 
your commands? You are still the Lord and Steward. Not all will follow 
Mithrandir. Men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned.' 

'Why? Why do the fools fly?' said Denethor. 'Better to burn sooner than 
late, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire! And I? I will go now to my 
pyre. To my pyre! No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No tomb! No long 
slow 

sleep of death embalmed. We will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship 
sailed hither from the West. The West has failed. Go back and burn!' 

The messengers without bow or answer turned and fled. 

Now Denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of Faramir that he 
had held. 'Fie is burning, already burning,' he said sadly. 'The house of his 
spirit crumbles.' Then stepping softly towards Pippin he looked down at him. 

'Farewell!' he said. 'Farewell, Peregrin son of Paladin! Your service 
has been short, and now it is drawing to an end. I release you from the 
little that remains. Go now, and die in what way seems best to you. And with 
whom you will, even that friend whose folly brought you to this death. Send 
for my servants and then go. Farewell!' 

'I will not say farewell, my lord,' said Pippin kneeling. And then 
suddenly hobbit-like once more, he stood up and looked the old man in the 
eyes. 'I will take your leave, sir,' he said; 'for I want to see Gandalf 
very much indeed. But he is no fool; and I will not think of dying until he 
despairs of life. But from my word and your service I do not wish to be 
released while you live. And if they come at last to the Citadel, I hope to 
be here and stand beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given 
me.' 

'Do as you will, Master Halfling,' said Denethor. 'But my life is 
broken. Send for my servants!' He turned back to Faramir. 

Pippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six men of 
the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the summons. But in a 
quiet voice Denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on Faramir's bed and take 
it up. And they did so, and lifting up the bed they bore it from the 
chamber. Slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be, 
and Denethor, now bending on a staff, followed them; and last came Pippin. 

Out from the White Tower they walked, as if to a funeral, out into the 
darkness, where the overhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull 
red. Softly they paced the great courtyard, and at a word from Denethor 




halted beside the Withered Tree. 

All was silent, save for the rumour of war in the City down below, and 
they heard the water dripping sadly from the dead branches into the dark 
pool. Then they went on through the Citadel gate, where the sentinel stared 
at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by. Turning westward they came 
at length to a door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle. Fen Hollen it 
was called, for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral, and only the 
Lord of the City might use that way, or those who bore the token of the 
tombs and tended the houses of the dead. Beyond it went a winding road that 
descended in many curves down to the narrow land under the shadow of 
Mindolluin's precipice where stood the mansions of the dead Kings and of 
their Stewards. 

A porter sat in a little house beside the way, and with fear in his 
eyes he came forth bearing a lantern in his hand. At the Lord's command he 
unlocked the door, and silently it swung back; and they passed through, 
taking the lantern from his hand. It was dark on the climbing road between 
ancient walls and many -pillared balusters looming in the swaying 
lantern-beam. Their slow feet echoed as they walked down, down, until at 
last they came to the Silent Street, Rath Dnnen, between pale domes and 
empty halls and images of men long dead; and they entered into the House of 
the Stewards and set down their burden. 

There Pippin, staring uneasily about him, saw that he was in a wide 
vaulted chamber, draped as it were with the great shadows that the little 
lantern threw upon its shrouded walls. And dimly to be seen were many rows 
of tables, carved of marble; and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands 
folded, head pillowed upon stone. But one table near at hand stood broad and 
bare. Upon it at a sign from Denethor they laid Faramir and his father side 
by side, and covered them with one covering, and stood then with bowed heads 
as mourners beside a bed of death. Then Denethor spoke in a low voice. 

'Here we will wait,' he said. 'But send not for the embalmers. Bring us 
wood quick to burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath; and pour oil upon 
it. And when I bid you thrust in a torch. Do this and speak no more to me. 
Farewell!' 

'By your leave, lord!' said Pippin and turned and fled in terror from 
the deathly house. 'Poor Faramir!' he thought. 'I must find Gandalf. Poor 
Faramir! Quite likely he needs medicine more than tears. Oh, where can I 
find Gandalf? In the thick of things, I suppose; and he will have no time to 




spare for dying men or madmen.' 

At the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard 
there. 'Your master is not himself,' he said. 'Go slow! Bring no fire to 
this place while Faramir lives! Do nothing until Gandalf comes!' 

'Who is the master of Minas Tirith?' the man answered. 'The Lord 
Denethor or the Grey Wanderer?' 

'The Grey Wanderer or no one, it would seem,' said Pippin, and he sped 
back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the 
astonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate 
of the Citadel. The sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the 
voice of Beregond. 

'Whither do you run, Master Peregrin?' he cried. 

'To find Mithrandir,' Pippin answered. 

'The Lord's errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me,' said 
Beregond; 'but tell me quickly, if you may: what goes forward? Whither has 
my Lord gone? I have just come on duty, but I heard that he passed towards 
the Closed Door, and men were bearing Faramir before him.' 

'Yes,' said Pippin, 'to the Silent Street.' 

Beregond bowed his head to hide his tears. 'They said that he was 
dying,' he sighed, 'and now he is dead.' 

'No,' said Pippin, 'not yet. And even now his death might be prevented, 

I think. But the Lord of the City, Beregond, has fallen before his city is 
taken. Fie is fey and dangerous.' Quickly he told of Denethor's strange words 
and deeds. 'I must find Gandalf at once.' 

'Then you must go down to the battle.' 

'I know. The Lord has given me leave. But, Beregond, if you can, do 
something to stop any dreadful thing happening.' 

'The Lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave 
their post for any cause, save at his own command.' 

'Well, you must choose between orders and the life of Faramir,' said 
Pippin. 'And as for orders, I think you have a madman to deal with, not a 
lord. I must run. I will return if I can.' 

He ran on, down, down towards the outer city. Men flying back from the 
burning passed him, and some seeing his livery turned and shouted, but he 
paid no heed. At last he was through the Second Gate, beyond which great 
fires leaped up between the walls. Yet it seemed strangely silent. No noise 
or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard. Then suddenly there was a 




dreadful cry and a great shock, and a deep echoing boom. Forcing himself on 
against a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees. Pippin 
turned a corner opening on the wide place behind the City Gate. He stopped 
dead. He had found Gandalf; but he shrank back, cowering into a shadow. 

Ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on. The drums 
rolled. To the north and to the south company upon company of the enemy 
pressed to the walls. There came great beasts, like moving houses in the red 
and fitful light, the mymakil of the Harad dragging through the lanes amid 
the fires huge towers and engines. Yet their Captain cared not greatly what 
they did or how many might be slain: their purpose was only to test the 
strength of the defence and to keep the men of Gondor busy in many places. 
It was against the Gate that he would throw his heaviest weight. Very strong 
it might be, wrought of steel and iron, and guarded with towers and bastions 
of indomitable stone, yet it was the key, the weakest point in all that high 
and impenetrable wall. 

The drums rolled louder. Fires leaped up. Great engines crawled across 
the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred 
feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the 
dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was 
shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond 
they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great 
beasts drew it, Ores surrounded it, and behind walked mountain -trolls to 
wield it. 

But about the Gate resistance still was stout, and there the knights of 
Dol Amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay. Shot and dart fell 
thick; siege-towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches. All before the 
walls on either side of the Gate the ground was choked with wreck and with 
bodies of the slain; yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up. 

Grond crawled on. Upon its housing no fire would catch; and though now 
and again some great beast that hauled it would go mad and spread stamping 
ruin among the ores innumerable that guarded it, their bodies were cast 
aside from its path and others took their place. 

Grond crawled on. The drums rolled wildly. Over the hills of slain a 
hideous shape appeared: a horseman, tall, hooded, cloaked in black. Slowly, 
trampling the fallen, he rode forth, heeding no longer any dart. He halted 
and held up a long pale sword. And as he did so a great fear fell on all, 
defender and foe alike; and the hands of men drooped to their sides, and no 




bow sang. For a moment all was still. 

The drums rolled and rattled. With a vast rush Grond was hurled forward 
by huge hands. It reached the Gate. It swung. A deep boom rumbled through 
the City like thunder running in the clouds. But the doors of iron and posts 
of steel withstood the stroke. 

Then the Black Captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a 
dreadful voice, speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror 
to rend both heart and stone. 

Thrice he cried. Thrice the great ram boomed. And suddenly upon the 
last stroke the Gate of Gondor broke. As if stricken by some blasting spell 
it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors 
tumbled in riven fragments to the ground. 

In rode the Lord of the Nazgyl. A great black shape against the fires 
beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of 
the Nazgyl, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all 
fled before his face. 

All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the 
Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free 
horses 

of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in 
Rath Dnnen. 

'You cannot enter here,' said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. ’Go 
back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that 
awaits you and your Master. Go!’ 

The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; 
and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and 
the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly 
laughter. 

’Old fool!’ he said. ’Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death 
when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!’ And with that he lifted high 
his sword and flames ran down the blade. 

Gandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away behind in some 
courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking 
nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far 
above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn. 

And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, 
horns, horns. In dark Mindolluin's sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of 




the North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last. 




Chapter 5 . The Ride of the Rohirrim 



It was dark and Merry could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled 
in a blanket; yet though the night was airless and windless, all about him 
hidden trees were sighing softly. He lifted his head. Then he heard it 
again: a sound like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain -steps. The 
throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point, 
now nearer, now further off. He wondered if the watchmen had heard it. 

He could not see them, but he knew that all round him were the 
companies of the Rohirrim. He could smell the horses in the dark, and could 
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle-covered ground. 

The host was bivouacked in the pine-woods that clustered about Eilenach 
Beacon, a tall hill standing up from the long ridges of the Dr®adan Forest 
that lay beside the great road in East Anurien. 

Tired as he was Merry could not sleep. He had ridden now for four days 
on end, and the ever -deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart. He 
began to wonder why he had been so eager to come, when he had been given 
every excuse, even his lord's command, to stay behind. He wondered, too, if 
the old King knew that he had been disobeyed and was angry. Perhaps not. 
There seemed to be some understanding between Dernhelm and Elfhelm, 
the 

Marshal who commanded the jored in which they were riding. He and all his 
men ignored Merry and pretended not to hear if he spoke. He might have been 
just another bag that Dernhelm was carrying. Dernhelm was no comfort: he 
never spoke to anyone. Merry felt small, unwanted, and lonely. Now the time 
was anxious, and the host was in peril. They were less than a day's ride 
from the out- walls of Minas Tirith that encircled the townlands. Scouts had 
been sent ahead. Some had not returned. Others hastening back had reported 
that the road was held in force against them. A host of the enemy was 
encamped upon it, three miles west of Amon Don, and some strength of men 
was 

already thrusting along the road and was no more than three leagues away. 
Ores were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside. The king and 
Jomer held council in the watches of the night. 

Merry wanted somebody to talk to, and he thought of Pippin. But that 




only increased his restlessness. Poor Pippin, shut up in the great city of 
stone, lonely and afraid. Merry wished he was a tall Rider like Jomer and 
could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue. He sat up, 
listening to the drums that were beating again, now nearer at hand. 
Presently he heard voices speaking low, and he saw dim half-shrouded 
lanterns passing through the trees. Men nearby began to move uncertainly in 
the dark. 

A tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him, cursing the tree-roots. 

He recognized the voice of the Marshal, Elfhelm. 

'I am not a tree-root, Sir,' he said, 'nor a bag, but a bruised hobbit. 

The least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot.' 

'Anything that can keep so in this devil's mirk,' answered Elfhelm. 

'But my lord sends word that we must set ourselves in readiness: orders may 
come for a sudden move.' 

'Is the enemy coming then?' asked Merry anxiously. 'Are those their 
drums? I began to think I was imagining them, as no one else seemed to take 
any notice of them.' 

'Nay, nay,' said Elfhelm, 'the enemy is on the road not in the hills. 

You hear the Woses, the Wild Men of the Woods: thus they talk together from 
afar. They still haunt Dr®adan Forest, it is said. Remnants of an older time 
they be, living few and secretly, wild and wary as the beasts. They go not 
to war with Gondor or the Mark; but now they are troubled by the darkness 
and the coming of the ores: they fear lest the Dark Years be returning, as 
seems likely enough. Let us be thankful that they are not hunting us: for 
they use poisoned arrows, it is said, and they are woodcrafty beyond 
compare. But they have offered their services to Thjoden. Even now one of 
their headmen is being taken to the king. Yonder go the lights. So much I 
have heard but no more. And now I must busy myself with my lord's 
commands. 

Pack yourself up, Master Bag!' He vanished into the shadows. 

Merry did not like this talk of wild men and poisoned darts, but quite 
apart from that a great weight of dread was on him. Waiting was unbearable. 
He longed to know what was going to happen. He got up and soon was 
walking 

warily in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees. 

Presently he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up 
for the king under a great tree. A large lantern, covered above, was hanging 




from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below. There sat Thjoden and 
Jomer, and before them on the ground sat a strange squat shape of a man, 
gnarled as an old stone, and the hairs of his scanty beard straggled on his 
lumpy chin like dry moss. He was short -legged and fat-armed, thick and 
stumpy, and clad only with grass about his waist. Merry felt that he had 
seen him before somewhere, and suddenly he remembered the P®kel-men 
of 

Dunharrow. Here was one of those old images brought to life, or maybe a 
creature descended in true line through endless years from the models used 
by the forgotten craftsmen long ago. 

There was a silence as Merry crept nearer, and then the Wild Man began 
to speak, in answer to some question, it seemed. His voice was deep and 
guttural, yet to Merry's surprise he spoke the Common Speech, though in a 
halting fashion, and uncouth words were mingled with it. 

’No, father of Horse-men,' he said, 'we fight not. Hunt only. Kill 
gorgyn in woods, hate ore-folk. You hate gorgyn too. We help as we can. Wild 
Men have long ears and long eyes; know all paths. Wild Men live here before 
Stone-houses; before Tall Men come up out of Water.' 

'But our need is for aid in battle,' said Jomer. 'How will you and your 
folk help us?' 

'Bring news,' said the Wild Man. 'We look out from hills. We climb big 
mountain and look down. Stone-city is shut. Fire burns there outside; now 
inside too. You wish to come there? Then you must be quick. But gorgyn and 
men out of far-away,' he waved a short gnarled arm eastward, 'sit on 
horse-road. Very many, more than Horse-men.' 

'How do you know that?' said Jomer. 

The old man's flat face and dark eyes showed nothing, but his voice was 
sullen with displeasure. 'Wild men are wild, free, but not children,' he 
answered. 'I am great headman, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn. I count many things: stars in 
sky, leaves on trees, men in the dark. You have a score of scores counted 
ten times and five. They have more. Big fight, and who will win? And many 
more walk round walls of Stone-houses.' 

'Alas! he speaks all too shrewdly,' said Thjoden. 'And our scouts say 
that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road. We cannot sweep 
them away in sudden onset.' 

'And yet we need great haste,' said Jomer. 'Mundburg is on fire!' 

'Let Ghvn-buri-Ghvn finish!' said the Wild Man. 'More than one road he 




knows. He will lead you by road where no pits are, no gorgyn walk, only Wild 
Men and beasts. Many paths were made when Stonehouse-folk were 
stronger. 

They carved hills as hunters carve beast-flesh. Wild Men think they ate 
stone for food. They went through Dr®adan to Rimmon with great wains. 
They 

go no longer. Road is forgotten, but not by Wild Men. Over hill and behind 
hill it lies still under grass and tree, there behind Rimmon and down to 
Don, and back at the end to Horse-men's road. Wild Men will show you that 
road. Then you will kill gorgyn and drive away bad dark with bright iron, 
and Wild Men can go back to sleep in the wild woods.' 

Jomer and the king spoke together in their own tongue. At length 
Thjoden turned to the Wild Man. 'We will receive your offer,' he said. 'For 
though we leave a host of foes behind, what matter? If the Stone-city falls, 
then we shall have no returning. If it is saved, then the ore-host itself 
will be cut off. If you are faithful, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn, then we will give you 
rich reward, and you shall have the friendship of the Mark for ever.' 

'Dead men are not friends to living men, and give them no gifts,' said 
the Wild Man. 'But if you live after the Darkness, then leave Wild Men alone 
in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any more. Ghvn-buri-Ghvn will 
not lead you into trap. He will go himself with father of Horse-men, and if 
he leads you wrong, you will kill him.' 

'So be it!' said Thjoden. 

'How long will it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road?' 
asked Jomer. 'We must go at foot-pace, if you guide us; and I doubt not the 
way is narrow.' 

'Wild Men go quick on feet,' said Ghvn. 'Way is wide for four horses in 
Stonewain Valley yonder,' he waved his hand southwards; 'but narrow at 
beginning and at end. Wild Man could walk from here to Don between sunrise 
and noon.' 

'Then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders,' said Jomer; 

'but we must reckon rather on some ten hours for all. Things unforeseen may 
hinder us, and if our host is all strung out, it will be long ere it can be 
set in order when we issue from the hills. What is the hour now?' 

'Who knows?' said Thjoden. 'All is night now.' 

'It is all dark, but it is not all night.' said Ghvn. 'When Sun comes 
we feel her, even when she is hidden. Already she climbs over 




East -mountains. It is the opening of day in the sky-fields.' 

'Then we must set out as soon as may be,' said Jomer. 'Even so we 
cannot hope to come to Gondor's aid today.' 

Merry waited to hear no more, but slipped away to get ready for the 
summons to the march. This was the last stage before the battle. It did not 
seem likely to him that many of them would survive it. But he thought of 
Pippin and the flames in Minas Tirith and thrust down his own dread. 

All went well that day, and no sight or sound had they of the enemy 
waiting to waylay them. The Wild Men had put out a screen of wary hunters, 
so that no ore or roving spy should learn of the movements in the hills. The 
light was more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the beleaguered city, 
and the Riders passed in long files like dark shadows of men and horses. 
Each company was guided by a wild woodman; but old Ghvn walked beside 
the 

king. The start had been slower than was hoped, for it had taken time for 
the Riders, walking and leading their horses, to find paths over the thickly 
wooded ridges behind their camp and down into the hidden Stonewain Valley. 
It was late in the afternoon when the leaders came to wide grey thickets 
stretching beyond the eastward side of Amon Don, and masking a great gap in 
the line of hills that from Nardol to Don ran east and west. Through the gap 
the forgotten wain-road long ago had run down, back into the main horse-way 
from the City through Anurien; but now for many lives of men trees had had 
their way with it, and it had vanished, broken and buried under the leaves 
of uncounted years. But the thickets offered to the Riders their last hope 
of cover before they went into open battle; for beyond them lay the road and 
the plains of Anduin, while east and southwards the slopes were bare and 
rocky, as the writhen hills gathered themselves together and climbed up, 
bastion upon bastion, into the great mass and shoulders of Mindolluin. 

The leading company was halted, and as those behind filed up out of the 
trough of the Stonewain Valley they spread out and passed to camping -places 
under the grey trees. The king summoned the captains to council. Jomer sent 
out scouts to spy upon the road; but old Ghvn shook his head. 

'No good to send Horse-men,' he said. 'Wild Men have already seen all 
that can be seen in the bad air. They will come soon and speak to me here.' 

The captains came; and then out of the trees crept warily other 
p®kel-shapes so like old Ghvn that Merry could hardly tell them apart. They 
spoke to Ghvn in a strange throaty language. 




Presently Ghvn turned to the king. 'Wild Men say many things ' he said. 
'First, be wary! Still many men in camp beyond Don, an hour's walk yonder,' 
he waved his arm west towards the black beacon. 'But none to see between 
here and Stone-folk's new walls. Many busy there. Walls stand up no longer: 
gorgyn knock them down with earth-thunder and with clubs of black iron. They 
are unwary and do not look about them. They think their friends watch all 
roads!' At that old Ghvn made a curious gurgling noise, and it seemed that 
he was laughing. 

'Good tidings!' cried Jomer. 'Even in this gloom hope gleams again. Our 
Enemy's devices oft serve us in his despite. The accursed darkness itself 
has been a cloak to us. And now, lusting to destroy Gondor and throw it down 
stone from stone, his ores have taken away my greatest fear. The out-wall 
could have been held long against us. Now we can sweep through - if once we 
win so far.' 

'Once again I thank you, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn of the woods,' said Thjoden. 
'Good fortune go with you for tidings and for guidance!' 

'Kill gorgynl Kill ore-folk! No other words please Wild Men ' answered 
Ghvn. 'Drive away bad air and darkness with bright iron!' 

'To do these things we have ridden far,' said the king, 'and we shall 
attempt them. But what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show.' 

Ghvn-buri-Ghvn squatted down and touched the earth with his horny brow 
in token of farewell. Then he got up as if to depart. But suddenly he stood 
looking up like some startled woodland animal snuffling a strange air. A 
light came in his eyes. 

'Wind is changing!' he cried, and with that, in a twinkling as it 
seemed, he and his fellows had vanished into the glooms, never to be seen by 
any Rider of Rohan again. Not long after far away eastward the faint drums 
throbbed again. Yet to no heart in all the host came any fear that the Wild 
Men were unfaithful, strange and unlovely though they might appear. 

'We need no further guidance,' said Elfhelm; 'for there are riders in 
the host who have ridden down to Mundburg in days of peace. I for one. When 
we come to the road it will veer south, and there will lie before us still 
seven leagues ere we reach the wall of the townlands. Along most of that way 
there is much grass on either side of the road. On that stretch the 
errand-riders of Gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed. We may ride 
it swiftly and without great rumour.' 

'Then since we must look for fell deeds and the need of all our 




strength,' said Jomer, 'I counsel that we rest now, and set out hence by 
night, and so time our going that we come upon the fields when tomorrow is 
as light as it will be, or when our lord gives the signal.' 

To this the king assented, and the captains departed. But soon Elfhelm 
returned. 'The scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey wood, 
lord,' he said, 'save two men only: two dead men and two dead horses.' 

'Well?' said Jomer. 'What of it?' 

'This, lord: they were errand-riders of Gondor; Hirgon was one maybe. 

At least his hand still clasped the Red Arrow, but his head was hewn off. 

And this also: it would seem by the signs that they were fleeing westward 
when they fell. As I read it, they found the enemy already on the out-wall, 
or assailing it, when they returned - and that would be two nights ago, if 
they used fresh horses from the posts, as is their wont. They could not 
reach the City and turned back.' 

'Alas!' said Thjoden. 'Then Denethor has heard no news of our riding 
and will despair of our coming.' 

'Need brooks no delay, yet late is better than never,' said Jomer. 'And 
mayhap in this time shall the old saw be proved truer than ever before since 
men spoke with mouth.' 

It was night. On either side of the road the host of Rohan was moving 
silently. Now the road passing about the skirts of Mindolluin turned 
southward. Far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the 
black sky and the sides of the great mountain loomed dark against it. They 
were drawing near the Rammas of the Pelennor; but the day was not yet come. 

The king rode in the midst of the leading company, his household-men 
about him. Elfhelm's jored came next; and now Merry noticed that Dernhelm 
had left his place and in the darkness was moving steadily forward, until at 
last he was riding just in rear of the king's guard. There came a check. 

Merry heard voices in front speaking softly. Out-riders had come back who 
had ventured forward almost to the wall. They came to the king. 

'There are great fires, lord,' said one. 'The City is all set about 
with flame, and the field is full of foes. But all seem drawn off to the 
assault. As well as we could guess, there are few left upon the out-wall, 
and they are heedless, busy in destruction.' 

'Do you remember the Wild Man's words, lord?' said another. 'I live 
upon the open Wold in days of peace; Wndfara is my name, and to me also the 
air brings messages. Already the wind is turning. There comes a breath out 




of the South; there is a sea -tang in it, faint though it be. The morning 
will bring new things. Above the reek it will be dawn when you pass the 
wall.' 

'If you speak truly, Wndfara, then may you live beyond this day in 
years of blessedness!' said Thjoden. He turned to the men of his household 
who were near, and he spoke now in a clear voice so that many also of the 
riders of the first jored heard him: 

'Now is the hour come, Riders of the Mark, sons of Eorl! Foes and fire 
are before you, and your homes far behind. Yet, though you fight upon an 
alien field, the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever. Oaths 
ye have taken: now fulfil them all, to lord and land and league of 
friendship!' 

Men clashed spear upon shield. 

'Jomer, my son! You lead the first jored' said Thjoden; 'and it shall 
go behind the king's banner in the centre. Elfhelm, lead your company to the 
right when we pass the wall. And Grimbold shall lead his towards the left. 
Let the other companies behind follow these three that lead, as they have 
chance. Strike wherever the enemy gathers. Other plans we cannot make, for 
we know not yet how things stand upon the field. Forth now, and fear no 
darkness!' 

The leading company rode off as swiftly as they could, for it was still 
deep dark, whatever change Wndfara might forebode. Merry was riding 
behind 

Dernhelm, clutching with the left hand while with the other he tried to 
loosen his sword in its sheath. He felt now bitterly the truth of the old 
king's words: in such a battle what would you do Meriadoc? Just this,' he 
thought: 'encumber a rider, and hope at best to stay in my seat and not be 
pounded to death by galloping hoofs!' 

It was no more than a league to where the out-walls had stood. They 
soon reached them; too soon for Merry. Wild cries broke out, and there was 
some clash of arms, but it was brief. The ores busy about the walls were few 
and amazed, and they were quickly slain or driven off. Before the ruin of 
the north-gate in the Rammas the king halted again. The first jored drew up 
behind him and about him on either side. Dernhelm kept close to the king, 
though Elfhelm's company was away on the right. Grimbold's men turned 
aside 

and passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward. 




Merry peered from behind Dernhelm's back. Far away, maybe ten miles or 
more, there was a great burning, but between it and the Riders lines of fire 
blazed in a vast crescent, at the nearest point less than a league distant. 

He could make out little more on the dark plain, and as yet he neither saw 
any hope of morning, nor felt any wind, changed or unchanged. 

Now silently the host of Rohan moved forward into the field of Gondor, 
pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide through breaches in a 
dike that men have thought secure. But the mind and will of the Black 
Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and as yet no tidings came to 
him warning that his designs held any flaw. 

After a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come 
between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still they were 
unchallenged, and still Thjoden gave no signal. At last he halted once 
again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very 
shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, 
motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly 
by anguish, or by dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry 
himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. 

His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too 
late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Thjoden would quail, bow his 
old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills. 

Then suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was 
in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far away, in the South the clouds 
could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay 
beyond them. 

But at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung 
from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second it stood dazzling far 
off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle: and then 
as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great 
boom. 

At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall 
and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud 
voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before: 
Arise, arise, Riders of Thjoden! 

Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! 
spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered, 
a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! 




Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor! 

With that he seized a great horn from Guthlbf his banner-bearer, and he 
blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the 
horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of 
Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the 
mountains. 

Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor! 

Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind 
him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he 
outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever 
before them. Jomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in 
his speed, and the front of the first jored roared like a breaker foaming to 
the shore, but Thjoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the 
battle-fury of his fathers ran like new tire in his veins, and he was borne 
up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oroml the Great in the battle of 
the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo 
it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the 
white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; 
and the darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror 
took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. 
And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, 
for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was 
fair and terrible came even to the City. 




Chapter 6 . The Battle of the Pelennor 
Fields 

But it was no orc-chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon 
Gondor. The darkness was breaking too soon, before the date that his Master 
had set for it: fortune had betrayed him for the moment, and the world had 
turned against him; victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched 
out his hand to seize it. But his arm was long. He was still in command, 
wielding great powers. King, Ringwraith, Lord of the Nazgyl, he had many 
weapons. He left the Gate and vanished. 

Thjoden King of the Mark had reached the road from the Gate to the 
River, and he turned towards the City that was now less than a mile distant. 

He slackened his speed a little, seeking new foes, and his knights came 
about him, and Dernhelm was with them. Ahead nearer the walls Elfhelm's 
men 

were among the siege-engines, hewing, slaying, driving their foes into the 
fire-pits. Well nigh all the northern half of the Pelennor was overrun, and 
there camps were blazing, ores were flying towards the River like herds 
before the hunters; and the Rohirrim went hither and thither at their will. 

But they had not yet overthrown the siege, nor won the Gate. Many foes stood 
before it, and on the further half of the plain were other hosts still 
unfought. Southward beyond the road lay the main force of the Haradrim, and 
there their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain. 

And he looked out, and in the growing light he saw the banner of the king, 
and that it was far ahead of the battle with few men about it. Then he was 
filled with a red wrath and shouted aloud, and displaying his standard, 
black serpent upon scarlet, he came against the white horse and the green 
with great press of men; and the drawing of the scimitars of the Southrons 
was like a glitter of stars. 

Then Thjoden was aware of him, and would not wait for his onset, but 
crying to Snowmane he charged headlong to greet him. Great was the clash of 
their meeting. But the white fury of the Northmen burned the hotter, and 
more skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitter. Fewer were 
they but they clove through the Southrons like a fire-bolt in a forest. 

Right through the press drove Thjoden Thengel's son, and his spear was 




shivered as he threw down their chieftain. Out swept his sword, and he 
spurred to the standard, hewed staff and bearer; and the black serpent 
foundered. Then all that was left unslain of their cavalry turned and fled 
far away. 

But lo ! suddenly in the midst of the glory of the king his golden 
shield was dimmed. The new morning was blotted from the sky. Dark fell 
about 

him. Horses reared and screamed. Men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on 
the ground. 

To me! To me!' cried Thjoden. 'Up Eorlingas! Fear no darkness!' But 
Snowmane wild with terror stood up on high, fighting with the air, and then 
with a great scream he crashed upon his side: a black dart had pierced him. 
The king fell beneath him. 

The great shadow descended like a falling cloud. And behold! it was a 
winged creature: if bird, then greater than all other birds, and it was 
naked, and neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were 
as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank. A creature of an older 
world maybe it was, whose kind, fingering in forgotten mountains cold 
beneath the Moon, outstayed their day, and in hideous eyrie bred this last 
untimely brood, apt to evil. And the Dark Lord took it, and nursed it with 
fell meats, until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly; 
and he gave it to his servant to be his steed. Down, down it came, and then, 
folding its fingered webs, it gave a croaking cry, and settled upon the body 
of Snowmane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck. 

Upon it sat a shape, black -mantled, huge and threatening. A crown of 
steel he bore, but between rim and robe naught was there to see, save only a 
deadly gleam of eyes: the Lord of the Nazgyl. To the air he had returned, 
summoning his steed ere the darkness failed, and now he was come again, 
bringing ruin, turning hope to despair, and victory to death. A great black 
mace he wielded. 

But Thjoden was not utterly forsaken. The knights of his house lay 
slain about him, or else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne 
far away. Yet one stood there still: Dernhelm the young, faithful beyond 
fear; and he wept, for he had loved his lord as a father. Right through the 
charge Merry had been borne unharmed behind him, until the Shadow came; 
and 

then Windfola had thrown them in his terror, and now ran wild upon the 




plain. Merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast, and such a horror was 
on him that he was blind and sick. 

'King's man! King's man!' his heart cried within him. 'You must stay by 
him. As a father you shall be to me, you said.' But his will made no answer, 
and his body shook. He dared not open his eyes or look up. 

Then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard Dernhelm 
speaking; yet now the voice seemed strange, recalling some other voice that 
he had known. 

'Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!' 

A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgyl and his prey! Or he 
will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of 
lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy 
shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.' 

A sword rang as it was drawn. 'Do what you will; but I will hinder it, 
if I may.' 

'Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!' 

Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It seemed 
that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. 'But 
no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Jowyn I am, Jomund's 
daughter. 

You stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! 
For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.' 

The winged creature screamed at her, but the Ringwraith made no answer, 
and was silent, as if in sudden doubt. Very amazement for a moment conquered 
Merry's fear. He opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them. 
There some paces from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it, 
and above it loomed the Nazgyl Lord like a shadow of despair. A little to 
the left facing them stood she whom he had called Dernhelm. But the helm of 
her secrecy, had fallen from her, and her bright hair, released from its 
bonds, gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders. Her eyes grey as the sea 
were hard and fell, and yet tears were on her cheek. A sword was in her 
hand, and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy's eyes. 

Jowyn it was, and Dernhelm also. For into Merry's mind flashed the 
memory of the face that he saw at the riding from Dunharrow: the face of one 
that goes seeking death, having no hope. Pity filled his heart and great 
wonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke. He clenched 
his hand. She should not die, so fair, so desperate At least she should not 




die alone, unaided. 

The face of their enemy was not turned towards him, but still he hardly 
dared to move, dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on him. Slowly, 
slowly he began to crawl aside; but the Black Captain, in doubt and malice 
intent upon the woman before him, heeded him no more than a worm in the 
mud. 

Suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings, and the wind of them 
was foul. Again it leaped into the air, and then swiftly fell down upon 
Jowyn, shrieking, striking with beak and claw. 

Still she did not blench: maiden of the Rohirrim, child of kings, 
slender but as a steel-blade, fair but terrible. A swift stroke she dealt, 
skilled and deadly. The outstretched neck she clove asunder, and the hewn 
head fell like a stone. Backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to 
ruin, vast wings outspread, crumpled on the earth; and with its fall the 
shadow passed away. A light fell about her, and her hair shone in the 
sunrise. 

Out of the wreck rose the Black Rider, tall and threatening, towering 
above her. With a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let 
fall his mace. Her shield was shivered in many pieces, and her arm was 
broken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent over her like a cloud, and his 
eyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill. 

But suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his 
stroke went wide, driving into the ground. Merry's sword had stabbed him 
from behind, shearing through the black mantle, and passing up beneath the 
hauberk had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee. 

’Jowyn! Jowyn!’ cried Merry. Then tottering, struggling up, with her 
last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle, as the great 
shoulders bowed before her. The sword broke sparkling into many shards. The 
crown rolled away with a clang. Jowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe. But 
lo! the mantle and hauberk were empty. Shapeless they lay now on the ground, 
torn and tumbled; and a cry went up into the shuddering air, and faded to a 
shrill wailing, passing with the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died, 
and was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world. 

And there stood Meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain, blinking 
like an owl in the daylight, for tears blinded him; and through a mist he 
looked on Jowyn’ s fair head, as she lay and did not move; and he looked on 
the face of the king, fallen in the midst of his glory, For Snowmane in his 




agony had rolled away from him again; yet he was the bane of his master. 

Then Merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it, and lo! Thjoden 
opened his eyes, and they were clear, and he spoke in a quiet voice though 
laboured. 

'Farewell, Master Holbytla!' he said. 'My body is broken. I go to my 
fathers. And even in their mighty company I shall not now be ashamed. I 
felled the black serpent. A grim morn, and a glad day, and a golden sunset!' 

Merry could not speak, but wept anew. 'Forgive me, lord,' he said at 
last, 'if I broke your command, and yet have done no more in your service 
than to weep at our parting.' 

The old king smiled. 'Grieve not! It is forgiven. Great heart will not 
be denied. Live now in blessedness; and when you sit in peace with your 
pipe, think of me! For never now shall I sit with you in Meduseld, as I 
promised, or listen to your herb-lore.' He closed his eyes, and Merry bowed 
beside him. Presently he spoke again. 'Where is Jomer? For my eyes darken, 
and I would see him ere I go. He must be king after me. And I would send 
word to Jowyn. She, she would not have me leave her, and now I shall not see 
her again, dearer than daughter.' 

'Lord, lord,' began Merry brokenly, 'she is—'; but at that moment 
there was a great clamour, and all about them horns and trumpets were 
blowing. Merry looked round: he had forgotten the war, and all the world 
beside, and many hours it seemed since the king rode to his fall, though in 
truth it was only a little while. But now he saw that they were in danger of 
being caught in the very midst of the great battle that would soon be 
joined. 

New forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the River; and 
from under the walls came the legions of Morgul; and from the southward 
fields came footmen of Harad with horsemen before them, and behind them 
rose 

the huge backs of the mymakil with war -towers upon them. But northward the 
white crest of Jomer led the great front of the Rohirrim which he had again 
gathered and marshalled; and out of the City came all the strength of men 
that was in it, and the silver swan of Dol Amroth was borne in the van, 
driving the enemy from the Gate. 

For a moment the thought flitted through Merry's mind: 'Where is 
Gandalf? Is he not here? Could he not have saved the king and Jowyn?' But 
thereupon Jomer rode up in haste, and with him came the knights of the 




household that still lived and had now mastered their horses. They looked in 
wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there: and their steeds 
would not go near. But Jomer leaped from the saddle, and grief and dismay 
fell upon him as he came to the king's side and stood there in silence. 

Then one of the knights took the king's banner from the hand of Guthlbf 
the banner-bearer who lay dead, and he lifted it up. Slowly Thjoden opened 
his eyes. Seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to Jomer. 

'Hail, King of the Mark!' he said. 'Ride now to victory! Bid Jowyn 
farewell!' And so he died, and knew not that Jowyn lay near him. And those 
who stood by wept, crying: 'Thjoden King! Thjoden King!' 

But Jomer said to them: 

Mourn not overmuch! Mighty was the fallen, 
meet was his ending. When his mound is raised, 
women then shall weep. War now calls us! 

Yet he himself wept as he spoke. 'Let his knights remain here,' he 
said; 'and bear his body in honour from the field, lest the battle ride over 
it! Yea, and all these other of the king's men that lie here.' And he looked 
at the slain, recalling their names. Then suddenly he beheld his sister 
Jowyn as she lay, and he knew her. He stood a moment as a man who is 
pierced 

in the midst of a cry by an arrow through the heart; and then his face went 
deathly white; and a cold fury rose in him, so that all speech failed him 
for a while. A fey mood took him. 

'Jowyn, Jowyn!' he cried at last: 'Jowyn, how come you here? What 
madness or devilry is this? Death, death, death! Death take us all!' 

Then without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of 
the City, he spurred headlong back to the front of the great host, and blew 
a horn, and cried aloud for the onset. Over the field rang his clear voice 
calling: 'Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world's ending!' 

And with that the host began to move. But the Rohirrim sang no more. 
Death they cried with one voice loud and terrible, and gathering speed like 
a great tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed, roaring 
away southwards. 

And still Meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears 
and no one spoke to him, indeed none seemed to heed him. He brushed away 
the 

tears, and stooped to pick up the green shield that Jowyn had given him; and 




he slung it at his back. Then he looked for his sword that he had let fall; 
for even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use 
his left hand. And behold! there lay his weapon, but the blade was smoking 
like a dry branch that has been thrust in a fire; and as he watched it, it 
writhed and withered and was consumed. 

So passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse. But glad 
would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in the 
North-kingdom when the D®nedain were young, and chief among their foes 
was 

the dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer king. No other blade, not though 
mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, 
cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to 
his will. 

Men now raised the king, and laying cloaks upon spear -truncheons they 
made shift to bear him away towards the City; and others lifted Jowyn gently 
up and bore her after him. But the men of the king's household they could 
not yet bring from the field; for seven of the king's knights had fallen 
there, and Djorwine their chief was among them. So they laid them apart from 
their foes and the fell beast and set spears about them. And afterwards when 
all was over men returned and made a fire there and burned the carcase of 
the beast; but for Snowmane they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which 
was carved in the tongues of Gondor and the Mark: 

Faithful servant yet master's bane 

Lightfoot's foal, swift Snowmane. 

Green and long grew the grass on Snowmane's Howe, but ever black and 
bare was the ground where the beast was burned. 

Now slowly and sadly Merry walked beside the bearers, and he gave no 
more heed to the battle. He was weary and full of pain, and his limbs 
trembled as with a chill. A great rain came out of the Sea, and it seemed 
that all things wept for Thjoden and Jowyn, quenching the fires in the City 
with grey tears. It was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the 
men of Gondor approaching. Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, rode up and 
drew 

rein before them. 

'What burden do you bear, Men of Rohan?' he cried. 

'Thjoden King,' they answered. 'He is dead. But Jomer King now rides in 
the battle: he with the white crest in the wind.' 




Then the prince went from his horse, and knelt by the bier in honour of 
the king and his great onset; and he wept. And rising he looked then on 
Jowyn and was amazed. 'Surely, here is a woman?' he said. 'Have even the 
women of the Rohirrim come to war in our need?' 

'Nay! One only,' they answered. 'The Lady Jowyn is she, sister of 
Jomer; and we knew naught of her riding until this hour, and greatly we rue 
it.' 

Then the prince seeing her beauty, though her face was pale and cold, 
touched her hand as he bent to look more closely on her. 'Men of Rohan!' he 
cried. 'Are there no leeches among you? She is hurt to the death maybe, but 
I deem that she yet lives.' And he held the bright-burnished vambrace that 
was upon his arm before her cold tips, and behold! a little mist was laid on 
it hardly to be seen. 

'Haste now is needed,' he said, and he sent one riding back swiftly to 
the City to bring aid. But he bowing low to the fallen, bade them farewell, 
and mounting rode away into battle. 

And now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of the Pelennor; and 
the din of arms rose upon high, with the crying of men and the neighing of 
horses. Horns were blown and trumpets were braying, and the mymakil were 
bellowing as they were goaded to war. Under the south walls of the City the 
footmen of Gondor now drove against the legions of Morgul that were still 
gathered there in strength. But the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of 
Jomer: H®rin the Tall Warden of the Keys, and the Lord of Lossarnach, and 
Hirluin of the Green Hills, and Prince Imrahil the fair with his knights all 
about him. 

Not too soon came their aid to the Rohirrim; for fortune had turned 
against Jomer, and his fury had betrayed him. The great wrath of his onset 
had utterly overthrown the front of his enemies, and great wedges of his 
Riders had passed clear through the ranks of the Southrons, discomfiting 
their horsemen and riding their footmen to ruin. But wherever the mymakil 
came there the horses would not go, but blenched and swerved away; and the 
great monsters were unfought, and stood like towers of defence, and the 
Haradrim rallied about them. And if the Rohirrim at their onset were thrice 
outnumbered by the Haradrim alone, soon their case became worse; for new 
strength came now streaming to the field out of Osgiliath. There they had 
been mustered for the sack of the City and the rape of Gondor, waiting on 
the call of their Captain. He now was destroyed; but Gothmog the lieutenant 




of Morgul had flung them into the fray; Easterlings with axes, and Variags 
of Khand. Southrons in scarlet, and out of Far Harad black men like 
half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues. Some now hastened up behind the 
Rohirrim, others held westward to hold off the forces of Gondor and prevent 
their joining with Rohan. 

It was even as the day thus began to turn against Gondor and their hope 
wavered that a new cry went up in the City, it being then midmorning, and a 
great wind blowing, and the rain flying north, and the sun shining. In that 
clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fear, and their last 
hope left them. 

For Anduin, from the bend at the Harlond, so flowed that from the City 
men could look down it lengthwise for some leagues, and the far-sighted 
could see any ships that approached. And looking thither they cried in 
dismay; for black against the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up 
on the wind: dromunds, and ships of great draught with many oars, and with 
black sails bellying in the breeze. 

The Corsairs of Umbar!' men shouted. 'The Corsairs of Umbar! Took! The 
Corsairs of Umbar are coming! So Belfalas is taken, and the Ethir, and 
Febennin is gone. The Corsairs are upon us! It is the last stroke of doom!' 

And some without order, for none could he found to command them in the 
City, ran to the bells and tolled the alarm; and some blew the trumpets 
sounding the retreat. 'Back to the walls!' they cried. 'Back to the walls! 

Come back to the City before all are overwhelmed!' But the wind that sped 
the ships blew all their clamour away. 

The Rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm. All too well they 
could see for themselves the black sails. For Jomer was now scarcely a mile 
from the Harlond, and a great press of his first foes was between him and 
the haven there, while new foes came swirling behind, cutting him off from 
the Prince. Now he looked to the River, and hope died in his heart, and the 
wind that he had blessed he now called accursed. But the hosts of Mordor 
were enheartened, and filled with a new lust and fury they came yelling to 
the onset. 

Stern now was Jomer's mood, and his mind clear again. He let blow the 
horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither; for he thought 
to make a great shield-wall at the last, and stand, and fight there on foot 
till all fell, and do deeds of song on the fields of Pelennor, though no man 
should be left in the West to remember the last King of the Mark. So he rode 




to a green hillock and there set his banner, and the White Horse ran 
rippling in the wind. 

Out of doubt, out of dark to the day's rising 

I came singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. 

To hope's end I rode and to heart's breaking: 

Now for wrath, now for ruin and a red nightfall! 

These staves he spoke, yet he laughed as he said them. For once more 
lust of battle was on him; and he was still unscathed, and he was young, and 
he was king: the lord of a fell people. And lo! even as he laughed at 
despair he looked out again on the black ships, and he lifted up his sword 
to defy them. 

And then wonder took him, and a great joy; and he cast his sword up in 
the sunlight and sang as he caught it. And all eyes followed his gaze, and 
behold! upon the foremost ship a great standard broke, and the wind 
displayed it as she turned towards the Harlond. There flowered a White Tree, 
and that was for Gondor; but Seven Stars were about it, and a high crown 
above it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond 
count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems 
by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it 
was wrought of mithril and gold. 

Thus came Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elessar, Isildur's heir, out of the 
Paths of the Dead, borne upon a wind from the Sea to the kingdom of Gondor; 
and the mirth of the Rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of 
swords, and the joy and wonder of the City was a music of trumpets and a 
ringing of bells. But the hosts of Mordor were seized with bewilderment, and 
a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled 
with their foes; and a black dread fell on them, knowing that the tides of 
fate had turned against them and their doom was at hand. 

East rode the knights of Dol Amroth driving the enemy before them: 
troll-men and Variags and ores that hated the sunlight. South strode Jomer 
and men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and 
the anvil. For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the Harlond and 
swept north like a storm. There came Legolas, and Gimli wielding his axe, 
and Halbarad with the standard, and Elladan and Elrohir with stars on their 
brow, and the dour-handed D®nedain, Rangers of the North, leading a great 
valour of the folk of Lebennin and Lamedon and the fiefs of the South. But 
before all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, And®ril like a new fire 




kindled, Narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the 
Star of Elendil. 

And so at length Jomer and Aragorn met in the midst of the battle, and 
they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad. 

'Thus we meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor lay between us,' 
said Aragorn. 'Did I not say so at the Hornburg?' 

'So you spoke,' said Jomer, 'but hope oft deceives, and I knew not then 
that you were a man foresighted. Yet twice blessed is help unlooked for, and 
never was a meeting of friends more joyful.' And they clasped hand in hand. 
'Nor indeed more timely,' said Jomer. 'You come none too soon, my friend. 
Much loss and sorrow has befallen us.' 

'Then let us avenge it, ere we speak of it!' said Aragorn, and they 
rode back to battle together. 

Hard fighting and long labour they had still; for the Southrons were 
bold men and grim, and fierce in despair; and the Easterlings were strong 
and war-hardened and asked for no quarter. And so in this place and that, by 
burned homestead or barn, upon hillock or mound, under wall or on field, 
still they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away. 

Then the Sun went at last behind Mindolluin and filled all the sky with 
a great burning, so that the hills and the mountains were dyed as with 
blood; fire glowed in the River, and the grass of the Pelennor lay red in 
the nightfall. And in that hour the great Battle of the field of Gondor was 
over; and not one living foe was left within the circuit of the Rammas. All 
were slain save those who fled to die, or to drown in the red foam of the 
River. Few ever came eastward to Morgul or Mordor; and to the land of the 
Haradrim came only a tale from far off: a rumour of the wrath and terror of 
Gondor. 

Aragorn and Jomer and Imrahil rode back towards the Gate of the City, 
and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow. These three were unscathed, 
for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms, and few 
indeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their 
wrath. But many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field. The axes 
hewed Forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed; and both Duilin of Morthond 
and his brother were trampled to death when they assailed the mymakil, 
leading their bowmen close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters. Neither 
Hirluin the fair would return to Pinnath Gelin, nor Grimbold to Grimslade, 
nor Halbarad to the Northlands, dour -handed Ranger. No few had fallen, 




renowned or nameless, captain or soldier; for it was a great battle and the 
full count of it no tale has told. So long afterward a maker in Rohan said 
in his song of the Mounds of Mundburg: 

We heard of the horns in the hills ringing, 
the swords shining in the South-kingdom. 

Steeds went striding to the Stoningland 
as wind in the morning. War was kindled. 

There Thjoden fell, Thengling mighty, 
to his golden halls and green pastures 
in the Northern fields never returning, 
high lord of the host. Harding and Guthlbf 
D®nhere and Djorwine, doughty Grimbold, 

Herefara and Herubrand, Horn and Fastred, 
fought and fell there in a far country: 
in the Mounds of Mundburg under mould they lie 
with their league-fellows, lords of Gondor. 

Neither Hirluin the Fair to the hills by the sea, 
nor Forlong the old to the flowering vales 
ever, to Arnach, to his own country 
returned in triumph; nor the tall bowmen, 

Derufin and Duilin, to their dark waters, 
meres ofMorthond under mountain-shadows. 

Death in the morning and at day's ending 
lords took and lowly. Long now they sleep 
under grass in Gondor by the Great River. 

Grey now as tears, gleaming silver, 
red then it rolled, roaring water: 
foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset; 
as beacons mountains burned at evening; 
red fell the dew in Rammas Echor. 




Chapter 7 . The Pyre of Denethor 



When the dark shadow at the Gate withdrew Gandalf still sat motionless. 
But Pippin rose to his feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him; 
and he stood listening to the horns, and it seemed to him that they would 
break his heart with joy. And never in after years could he hear a horn 
blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes. But now suddenly 
his errand returned to his memory, and he ran forward. At that moment 
Gandalf stirred and spoke to Shadowfax, and was about to ride through the 
Gate. 

'Gandalf, Gandalf! ' cried Pippin, and Shadowfax halted. 

’What are you doing here?' said Gandalf. 'Is it not a law in the City 
that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the Citadel, unless 
their lord gives them leave?' 

'He has,' said Pippin. 'He sent me away. But I am frightened. Something 
terrible may happen up there. The Lord is out of his mind, I think. I am 
afraid he will kill himself, and kill Faramir too. Can't you do something?' 

Gandalf looked through the gaping Gate, and already on the fields he 
heard the gathering sound of battle. He clenched his hand. 'I must go ' he 
said. 'The Black Rider is abroad, and he will yet bring ruin on us. I have 
no time.' 

'But Faramir!' cried Pippin. 'He is not dead, and they will burn him 
alive, if someone does not stop them.' 

'Burn him alive?' said Gandalf. 'What is this tale? Be quick!' 

'Denethor has gone to the Tombs,' said Pippin, 'and he has taken 
Faramir, and he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are 
to make a pyre and burn him on it, and Faramir as well. And he has sent men 
to fetch wood and oil. And I have told Beregond, but I'm afraid he won't 
dare to leave his post: he is on guard. And what can he do anyway?' So 
Pippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching Gandalf s knee with 
trembling hands. 'Can't you save Faramir?' 

'Maybe I can,' said Gandalf; 'but if I do, then others will die, I 
fear. Well, I must come, since no other help can reach him. But evil and 
sorrow will come of this. Even in the heart of our stronghold the Enemy has 
power to strike us: for his will it is that is at work.' 




Then having made up his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up Pippin 
and setting him before him, he turned Shadowfax with a word. Up the climbing 
streets of Minas Tirith they clattered, while the noise of war rose behind 
them. Everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread, seizing their 
weapons, crying one to another: ’Rohan has come!' Captains were shouting, 
companies were mustering; many already were marching down to the Gate. 

They met the Prince Imrahil, and he called to them: 'Whither now, 
Mithrandir? The Rohirrim are fighting on the fields of Gondor! We must 
gather all the strength that we can find.’ 

’You will need every man and more,' said Gandalf. 'Make all haste. I 
will come when I can. But I have an errand to the Lord Denethor that will 
not wait. Take command in the Lord's absence!' 

They passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the Citadel they 
felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morning 
far away, a light growing in the southern sky. But it brought little hope to 
them, not knowing what evil lay before them, fearing to come too late. 

'Darkness is passing,' said Gandalf, 'but it still lies heavy on this 
City.' 

At the gate of the Citadel they found no guard. 'Then Beregond has 
gone,' said Pippin more hopefully. They turned away and hastened along the 
road to the Closed Door. It stood wide open, and the porter lay before it. 

He was slain and his key had been taken. 

'Work of the Enemy!' said Gandalf. 'Such deeds he loves: friend at war 
with friend; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts.' Now he dismounted and 
bade Shadowfax return to his stable. 'Lor, my friend,' he said, 'you and I 
should have ridden to the fields long ago, but other matters delay me. Yet 
come swiftly if I call!' 

They passed the Door and walked on down the steep winding road. Light 
was growing, and the tall columns and carven figures beside the way went 
slowly by like grey ghosts. 

Suddenly the silence was broken, and they heard below them cries and 
the ringing of swords: such sounds as had not been heard in the hallowed 
places since the building of the City. At last they came to Rath Dnnen and 
hastened towards the House of the Stewards, looming in the twilight under 
its great dome. 

'Stay! Stay!' cried Gandalf, springing forward to the stone stair 
before the door. 'Stay this madness!' 




For there were the servants of Denethor with swords and torches in 
their hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood Beregond, 
clad in the black and silver of the Guard; and he held the door against 
them. Two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with 
their blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to 
his master. 

Even as Gandalf and Pippin ran forward, they heard from within the 
house of the dead the voice of Denethor crying: 'Haste, haste! Do as I have 
bidden! Slay me this renegade! Or must I do so myself?' Thereupon the door 
which Beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open, and there 
behind him stood the Lord of the City, tall and fell; a light like flame was 
in his eyes, and he held a drawn sword. 

But Gandalf sprang up the steps, and the men fell back from him and 
covered their eyes; for his coming was like the incoming of a white light 
into a dark place, and he came with great anger. He lifted up his hand, and 
in the very stroke, the sword of Denethor flew up and left his grasp and 
fell behind him in the shadows of the house; and Denethor stepped backward 
before Gandalf as one amazed. 

'What is this, my lord?' said the wizard. 'The houses of the dead are 
no places for the living. And why do men fight here in the Hallows when 
there is war enough before the Gate? Or has our Enemy come even to Rath 
Dnnen?' 

'Since when has the Lord of Gondor been answerable to thee?' said 
Denethor. 'Or may I not command my own servants?' 

'You may,' said Gandalf. 'But others may contest your will, when it is 
turned to madness and evil. Where is your son, Faramir?' 

'He lies within,' said Denethor, 'burning, already burning. They have 
set a fire in his flesh. But soon all shall be burned. The West has failed. 

It shall all go up in a great fire, and all shall be ended. Ash! Ash and 
smoke blown away on the wind!' 

Then Gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had 
already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Beregond and Pippin 
behind him, while Denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. 
But there they found Faramir, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the 
table. Wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched 
with oil, even the garments of Faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire 
had been set to the fuel. Then Gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in 




him; even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle. He 
leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down 
again, and bore him towards the door. But as he did so Faramir moaned and 
called on his father in his dream. 

Denethor started as one waking from a trance, and the flame died in his 
eyes, and he wept; and he said: 'Do not take my son from me! He calls for 
me.' 

'He calls,' said Gandalf, 'but you cannot come to him yet. For he must 
seek healing on the threshold of death, and maybe find it not. Whereas your 
part is to go out to the battle of your City, where maybe death awaits you. 

This you know in your heart.' 

'He will not wake again,' said Denethor. 'Battle is vain. Why should we 
wish to live longer? Why should we not go to death side by side?' 

'Authority is not given to you, Steward of Gondor, to order the hour of 
your death,' answered Gandalf. 'And only the heathen kings, under the 
domination of the Dark Power, did thus, slaying themselves in pride and 
despair, murdering their kin to ease their own death.' Then passing through 
the door he took Faramir from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on 
which he had been brought, and which had now been set in the porch. Denethor 
followed him, and stood trembling, looking with longing on the face of his 
son. And for a moment, while all were silent and still, watching the Lord in 
his throes, he wavered. 

'Come!' said Gandalf. 'We are needed. There is much that you can yet 
do.' 

Then suddenly Denethor laughed. He stood up tall and proud again, and 
stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his 
head had lain. Then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering, and 
lo! he had between his hands a palantnr. And as he held it up, it seemed to 
those that looked on that the globe began to glow with an inner flame, so 
that the lean face of the Lord was lit as with a red fire, and it seemed cut 
out of hard stone, sharp with black shadows, noble, proud, and terrible. His 
eyes glittered. 

'Pride and despair!' he cried. 'Didst thou think that the eyes of the 
White Tower were blind? Nay, I have seen more than thou knowest, Grey 
Fool. 

For thy hope is but ignorance. Go then and labour in healing! Go forth and 
fight! Vanity. For a little space you may triumph on the field, for a day. 




But against the Power that now arises there is no victory. To this City only 
the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched. All the East is moving. 

And even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee and wafts up Anduin a fleet 
with black sails. The West has failed. It is time for all to depart who 
would not be slaves.' 

'Such counsels will make the Enemy's victory certain indeed,' said 
Gandalf. 

'Hope on then!' laughed Denethor. 'Do I not know thee, Mithrandir? Thy 
hope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every throne, north, south, or 
west. I have read thy mind and its policies. Do I not know that you 
commanded this halfling here to keep silence? That you brought him hither to 
be a spy within my very chamber? And yet in our speech together I have 
learned the names and purpose of all thy companions. So! With the left hand 
thou wouldst use me for a little while as a shield against Mordor, and with 
the right bring up this Ranger of the North to supplant me. 

'But I say to thee, Gandalf Mithrandir, I will not be thy tool! I am 
Steward of the House of Anbrion. I will not step down to be the dotard 
chamberlain of an upstart. Even were his claim proved to me, still he comes 
but of the line of Isildur. I will not bow to such a one, last of a ragged 
house long bereft of lordship and dignity.' 

'What then would you have,' said Gandalf, 'if your will could have its 
way?' 

'I would have things as they were in all the days of my life,' answered 
Denethor, 'and in the days of my longfathers before me: to be the Lord of 
this City in peace, and leave my chair to a son after me, who would be his 
own master and no wizard's pupil. But if doom denies this to me, then I will 
have naught, neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated.' 

'To me it would not seem that a Steward who faithfully surrenders his 
charge is diminished in love or in honour,' said Gandalf. 'And at the least 
you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt.' 

At those words Denethor's eyes flamed again, and taking the Stone under 
his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier. But Beregond sprang 
forward and set himself before Faramir. 

'So!' cried Denethor. 'Thou hadst already stolen half my son's love. 

Now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also, so that they rob me wholly 
of my son at the last. But in this at least thou shalt not defy my will: to 
rule my own end.' 




'Come hither!' he cried to his servants. 'Come, if you are not all 
recreant!' Then two of them ran up the steps to him. Swiftly he snatched a 
torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house. Before Gandalf 
could hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel, and at once it crackled 
and roared into flame. 

Then Denethor leaped upon the table, and standing there wreathed in 
fire and smoke he took up the staff of his stewardship that lay at his feet 
and broke it on his knee. Casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and 
laid himself on the table, clasping the palantnr with both hands upon his 
breast. And it was said that ever after, if any man looked in that Stone, 
unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpose, he saw 
only two aged hands withering in flame. 

Gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door. 

For a while he stood in thought, silent upon the threshold, while those 
outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within. And then Denethor gave 
a great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor was ever again seen by mortal 
men. 

'So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion,' said Gandalf: Then he turned to 
Beregond and the Lord's servants that stood there aghast. 'And so pass also 
the days of Gondor that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. Ill 
deeds have been done here; but let now all enmity that lies between you be 
put away, for it was contrived by the Enemy and works his will. You have 
been caught in a net of warring duties that you did not weave. But think, 
you servants of the Lord, blind in your obedience, that but for the treason 
of Beregond Faramir, Captain of the White Tower, would now also be burned. 

'Bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen. And 
we will bear Faramir, Steward of Gondor, to a place where he can sleep in 
peace, or die if that be his doom.' 

Then Gandalf and Beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the 
Houses of Healing, while behind them walked Pippin with downcast head. 
But 

the servants of the Lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the 
dead; and even as Gandalf came to the end of Rath Dnnen there was a great 
noise. Looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue 
forth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; 
but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins. Then in 
terror the servants fled and followed Gandalf. 




At length they came back to the Steward’s Door, and Beregond looked 
with grief at the porter. This deed I shall ever rue,' he said; 'but a 
madness of haste was on me, and he would not listen, but drew sword against 
me.' Then taking the key that he had wrested from the slain man he closed 
the door and locked it. This should now be given to the Lord Faramir,' he 
said. 

The Prince of Dol Amroth is in command in the absence of the Lord,' 
said Gandalf; 'but since he is not here, I must take this on myself. I bid 
you keep the key and guard it, until the City is set in order again.' 

Now at last they passed into the high circles of the City, and in the 
light of morning they went their way towards the Houses of Healing; and 
these were fair houses set apart, for the care of those who were grievously 
sick, but now they were prepared for the tending of men hurt in battle or 
dying. They stood not far from the Citadel-gate, in the sixth circle, nigh 
to its southward wall, and about them was a garden and a greensward with 
trees, the only such place in the City. There dwelt the few women that had 
been permitted to remain in Minas Tirith, since they were skilled in healing 
or in the service of the healers. 

But even as Gandalf and his companions came carrying the bier to the 
main door of the Houses, they heard a great cry that went up from the field 
before the Gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died 
away on the wind. So terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, 
and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a 
hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the East; and it 
seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the 
clouds. 

But Gandalf s face was grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and Pippin 
to take Faramir into the Houses of Healing, he went up on to the walls 
nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and 
looked out. And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had 
befallen; and when Jomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood 
beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about 
him again, and went from the walls. And Beregond and Pippin found him 
standing in thought before the door of the Houses when they came out. 

They looked at him, and for a while he was silent. At last he spoke. 

'My friends,' he said, 'and all you people of this city and of the Western 
lands! Things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass. Shall we weep or 




be glad? Beyond hope the Captain of our foes has been destroyed, and you 
have heard the echo of his last despair. But he has not gone without woe and 
bitter loss. And that I might have averted but for the madness of Denethor. 

So long has the reach of our Enemy become! Alas! but now I perceive how his 
will was able to enter into the very heart of the City. 

'Though the Stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by 
themselves, long ago I guessed that here in the White Tower, one at least of 
the Seven Seeing Stones was preserved. In the days of his wisdom Denethor 
did not presume to use it, nor to challenge Sauron, knowing the limits of 
his own strength. But his wisdom failed; and I fear that as the peril of his 
realm grew he looked in the Stone and was deceived: far too often, I guess, 
since Boromir departed. He was too great to be subdued to the will of the 
Dark Power, he saw nonetheless only those things which that Power permitted 
him to see. The knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service 
to him; yet the vision of the great might of Mordor that was shown to him 
fed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.' 

'Now I understand what seemed so strange to me!' said Pippin shuddering 
at his memories as he spoke. 'The Lord went away from the room where 
Far amir 

lay; and it was only when he returned that I first thought he was changed, 
old and broken.' 

'It was in the very hour that Faramir was brought to the Tower that 
many of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber,' said Beregond. 'But 
we have seen that light before, and it has long been rumoured in the City, 
that the Lord would at times wrestle in thought with his Enemy.' 

'Alas! then I have guessed rightly,' said Gandalf. 'Thus the will of 
Sauron entered into Minas Tirith; and thus I have been delayed here. And 
here I shall still be forced to remain, for I shall soon have other charges, 
not Faramir only. 

'Now I must go down to meet those who come. I have seen a sight upon 
the field that is very grievous to my heart, and greater sorrow may yet come 
to pass. Come with me, Pippin! But you, Beregond, should return to the 
Citadel and tell the chief of the Guard there what has befallen. It will be 
his duty, I fear, to withdraw you from the Guard; but say to him that, if I 
may give him counsel, you should be sent to the Houses of Healing, to be the 
guard and servant of your captain, and to be at his side when he awakes - if 
that shall ever be again. For by you he was saved from the fire. Go now ! I 




shall return soon.' 

With that he turned away and went with Pippin down towards the lower 
city. And even as they hastened on their way the wind brought a grey rain, 
and all the fires sank, and there arose a great smoke before them. 




Chapter 8 . The Houses of Healing 



A mist was in Merry's eyes of tears and weariness when they drew near 
the ruined Gate of Minas Tirith. He gave little heed to the wreck and 
slaughter that lay about all. Fire and smoke and stench was in the air; for 
many engines had been burned or cast into the fire-pits, and many of the 
slain also, while here and there lay many carcases of the great Southron 
monsters, half-burned, or broken by stone-cast, or shot through the eyes by 
the valiant archers of Morthond. The flying rain had ceased for a time, and 
the sun gleamed up above; but all the lower city was still wrapped in a 
smouldering reek. 

Already men were labouring to clear a way through the jetsam of battle; 
and now out from the Gate came some bearing litters. Gently they laid Jowyn 
upon soft pillows; but the king’s body they covered with a great cloth of 
gold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the 
sunlight, were fluttered by the wind. 

So Thjoden and Jowyn came to the City of Gondor, and all who saw them 
bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the 
burned circle, and went on and up along the streets of stone. To Merry the 
ascent seemed agelong, a meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on 
and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize. 

Slowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went 
out, and he was walking in a darkness; and he thought: 'This is a tunnel 
leading to a tomb; there we shall stay forever.' But suddenly into his dream 
there fell a living voice. 

'Well, Merry! Thank goodness I have found you!' 

He looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little. There was 
Pippin! They were face to face in a narrow lane, and but for themselves it 
was empty. He rubbed his eyes. 

'Where is the king?' he said. 'And Jowyn?' Then he stumbled and sat 
down on a doorstep and began to weep again. 

'They have gone up into the Citadel,' said Pippin. 'I think you must 
have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning. When we found 
that you were not with them, Gandalf sent me to look for you. Poor old 
Merry! How glad I am to see you again! But you are worn out, and I won't 




bother you with any talk. But tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?' 

'No,' said Merry. 'Well, no, I don't think so. But I can't use my right 
arm, Pippin, not since I stabbed him. And my sword burned all away like a 
piece of wood.' 

Pippin's face was anxious. 'Well, you had better come with me as quick 
as you can,' he said. 'I wish I could carry you. You aren't fit to walk any 
further. They shouldn't have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. 

So many dreadful things have happened in the City, Merry, that one poor 
hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked.' 

'It's not always a misfortune being overlooked,' said Merry. 'I was 
overlooked just now by - no, no, I can't speak of it. Help me, Pippin! It's 
all going dark again, and my arm is so cold.' 

'Lean on me, Merry lad!' said Pippin. 'Come now! Foot by foot. It's not 
far.' 

'Are you going to bury me?' said Merry. 

'No, indeed!' said Pippin, trying to sound cheerful, though his heart 
was wrung with fear and pity. 'No, we are going to the Houses of Healing.' 

They turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer 
wall of the fourth circle, and they regained the main street climbing up to 
the Citadel. Step by step they went, while Merry swayed and murmured as one 
in sleep. 

'I'll never get him there,' thought Pippin. 'Is there no one to help 
me? I can't leave him here.' Just then to his surprise a boy came running up 
behind, and as he passed he recognized Bergil Beregond's son. 

'Hullo, Bergil!' he called. 'Where are you going? Glad to see you 
again, and still alive!' 

'I am running errands for the Healers,' said Bergil. 'I cannot stay.' 

'Don't!' said Pippin. 'But tell them up there that I have a sick 
hobbit, a perian mind you, come from the battle-field. I don't think he can 
walk so far. If Mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.' Bergil 
ran on. 

'I'd better wait here,' thought Pippin. So he let Merry sink gently 
down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight, and then he sat down beside 
him, laying Merry's head in his lap. He felt his body and limbs gently, and 
took his friend's hands in his own. The right hand felt icy to the touch. 

It was not long before Gandalf himself came in search of them. He 
stooped over Merry and caressed his brow; then he lifted him carefully. 'He 




should have been borne in honour into this city,' he said. 'He has well 
repaid my trust; for if Elrond had not yielded to me, neither of you would 
have set out; and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have 
been.' He sighed. 'And yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the 
time the battle hangs in the balance.' 

So at last Faramir and Jowyn and Meriadoc were laid in beds in the 
Houses of Healing; and there they were tended well. For though all lore was 
in these latter days fallen from its fullness of old, the leechcraft of 
Gondor was still wise, and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt, and all 
such sickness as east of the Sea mortal men were subject to. Save old age 
only. For that they had found no cure; and indeed the span of their lives 
had now waned to little more than that of other men, and those among them 
who passed the tale of five score years with vigour were grown few, save in 
some houses of purer blood. But now their art and knowledge were baffled; 
for there were many sick of a malady that would not be healed; and they 
called it the Black Shadow, for it came from the Nazgyl. And those who were 
stricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream, and then passed to 
silence and a deadly cold, and so died. And it seemed to the tenders of the 
sick that on the Halfling and on the Fady of Rohan this malady lay heavily. 
Still at whiles as the morning wore away they would speak, murmuring in 
their dreams; and the watchers listened to all that they said, hoping 
perhaps to learn something that would help them to understand their hurts. 
But soon they began to fall down into the darkness, and as the sun turned 
west a grey shadow crept over their faces. But Faramir burned with a fever 
that would not abate. 

Gandalf went from one to the other full of care, and he was told all 
that the watchers could hear. And so the day passed, while the great battle 
outside went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings; and still Gandalf 
waited and watched and did not go forth; till at last the red sunset filled 
all the sky, and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the 
sick. Then it seemed to those who stood by that in the glow the faces 
flushed softly as with health returning, but it was only a mockery of hope. 

Then an old wife, Ioreth, the eldest of the women who served in that 
house, looking on the fair face of Faramir, wept, for all the people loved 
him. And she said: 'Alas! if he should die. Would that there were kings in 
Gondor, as there were once upon a time, they say! For it is said in old 
lore: The hands of the king are the hands of a healer. And so the rightful 




king could ever be known.' 

And Gandalf, who stood by, said: 'Men may long remember your words, 
Ioreth! For there is hope in them. Maybe a king has indeed returned to 
Gondor; or have you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the 
City?' 

'I have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and 
shouting,' she answered. 'All I hope is that those murdering devils do not 
come to this House and trouble the sick.' 

Then Gandalf went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky was 
burning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ash-grey evening 
crept over the fields. 

Now as the sun went down Aragorn and Jomer and Imrahil drew near the 
City with their captains and knights; and when they came before the Gate 
Aragorn said: 

'Behold the Sun setting in a great fire! It is a sign of the end and 
fall of many things, and a change in the tides of the world. But this City 
and realm has rested in the charge of the Stewards for many long years, and 
I fear that if I enter it unbidden, then doubt and debate may arise, which 
should not be while this war is fought. I will not enter in, nor make any 
claim, until it be seen whether we or Mordor shall prevail. Men shall pitch 
my tents upon the field, and here I will await the welcome of the Lord of 
the City.' 

But Jomer said: 'Already you have raised the banner of the Kings and 
displayed the tokens of Elendil's House. Will you suffer these to be 
challenged?' 

'No,' said Aragorn. 'But I deem the time unripe; and I have no mind for 
strife except with our Enemy and his servants.' 

And the Prince Imrahil said. Your words, lord, are wise, if one who is 
a kinsman of the Lord Denethor may counsel you in this matter. He is 
strong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has been strange since his 
son was stricken down. Yet I would not have you remain like a beggar at the 
door.' 

'Not a beggar,' said Aragorn. 'Say a captain of the Rangers, who are 
unused to cities and houses of stone.' And he commanded that his banner 
should be furled; and he did off the Star of the North Kingdom and gave it 
to the keeping of the sons of Elrond. 

Then the Prince Imrahil and Jomer of Rohan left him and passed through 




the City and the tumult of the people, and mounted to the Citadel; and they 
came to the Hall of the Tower, seeking the Steward. But they found his chair 
empty, and before the dais lay Thjoden King of the Mark upon a bed of state; 
and twelve torches stood about it, and twelve guards, knights both of Rohan 
and Gondor. And the hangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon 
the king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast, and upon that 
his unsheathed sword, and at his feet his shield, The light of the torches 
shimmered in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain, but his 
face was fair and young, save that a peace lay on it beyond the reach of 
youth; and it seemed that he slept. 

When they had stood silent for a time beside the king, Imrahil said: 
'Where is the Steward? And where also is Mithrandir?' 

And one of the guards answered: 'The Steward of Gondor is in the Houses 
of Healing.' 

But Jomer said: 'Where is the Lady Jowyn, my sister; for surely she 
should be lying beside the king, and in no less honour? Where have they 
bestowed her?' 

And Imrahil said: 'But the Lady Jowyn was yet living when they bore her 
hither. Did you not know?' 

Then hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to Jomer's heart, and with it 
the bite of care and fear renewed, that he said no more, but turned and went 
swiftly from the hall; and the Prince followed him. And when they came forth 
evening had fallen and many stars were in the sky. And there came Gandalf on 
foot and with him one cloaked in grey; and they met before the doors of the 
Houses of Healing. And they greeted Gandalf and said: 'We seek the Steward, 
and men say that he is in this House. Has any hurt befallen him? And the 
Lady Jowyn, where is she?' 

And Gandalf answered: 'She lies within and is not dead, but is near 
death. But the Lord Faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, 
and he is now the Steward; for Denethor has departed, and his house is in 
ashes.' And they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told. 

But Imrahil said: 'So victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter 
bought, if both Gondor and Rohan are in one day bereft of their lords. Jomer 
rules the Rohirrim. Who shall rule the City meanwhile? Shall we not send now 
for the Lord Aragorn?' 

And the cloaked man spoke and said: 'He is come.' And they saw as he 
stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was Aragorn, 




wrapped in the grey cloak of Lurien above his mail, and bearing no other 
token than the green stone of Galadriel. 'I have come because Gandalf begs 
me to do so,’ he said. 'But for the present I am but the Captain of the 
D®nedain of Arnor; and the Lord of Dol Amroth shall rule the City until 
Faramir awakes. But it is my counsel that Gandalf should rule us all in the 
days that follow and in our dealings with the Enemy.' And they agreed upon 
that. 

Then Gandalf said: 'Let us not stay at the door, for the time is 
urgent. Let us enter! For it is only in the coming of Aragorn that any hope 
remains for the sick that lie in the Flouse. Thus spake Ioreth, wise- woman of 
Gondor: The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the 
rightful king be known .' 

Then Aragorn entered first and the others followed. And there at the 
door were two guards in the livery of the Citadel: one tall, but the other 
scarce the height of a boy; and when he saw them he cried aloud in surprise 
and joy. 

'Strider! Flow splendid! Do you know, I guessed it was you in the black 
ships. But they were all shouting corsairs and wouldn't listen to me. How 
did you do it?' 

Aragorn laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. 'Well met indeed!' he 
said. 'But there is not time yet for travellers' tales.' 

But Imrahil said to Jomer: 'Is it thus that we speak to our kings? Yet 
maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!' 

And Aragorn hearing him, turned and said: 'Verily, for in the high 
tongue of old I am Elessar, the Elfstone, and Envinyatar, the Renewed: and 
he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. 'But Strider shall 
be the name of my house, if that be ever established. In the high tongue it 
will not sound so ill, and Telcontar I will be and all the heirs of my 
body.' 

And with that they passed into the House; and as they went towards the 
rooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the deeds of Jowyn and 
Meriadoc. 'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke 
much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it 
is given to me to see many things far off.' 

Aragorn went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady Jowyn, and last to 
Merry. When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he 
sighed. 'Here I must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,' 




he said. 'Would that Elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, 
and has the greater power.' 

And Jomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said: 'First you must 
rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?' 

But Aragorn answered: 'Nay, for these three, and most soon for Faramir, 
time is running out. All speed is needed.' 

Then he called to Ioreth and he said: 'You have store in this House of 
the herbs of healing?' 

'Yes, lord,' she answered; 'but not enough, I reckon, for all that will 
need them. But I am sure I do not know where we shall find more; for all 
things are amiss in these dreadful days, what with fires and burnings, and 
the lads that run errands so few, and all the roads blocked. Why, it is days 
out of count since ever a carrier came in from Fossarnach to the market! But 
we do our best in this House with what we have, as I am sure your lordship 
will know.' 

'I will judge that when I see,' said Aragorn. 'One thing also is short 
time for speech. Have you athelasT 

'I do not know, I am sure, lord,' she answered, 'at least not by that 
name. I will go and ask of the herb-master; he knows all the old names.' 

'It is also called kingsfoil,' said Aragorn; 'and maybe you know it by 
that name, for so the country-folk call it in these latter days.' 'Oh that!' 
said Ioreth. 'Well, if your lordship had named it at first I could have told 
you. No, we have none of it, I am sure. Why, I have never heard that it had 
any great virtue; and indeed I have often said to my sisters when we came 
upon it growing in the woods: "kingsfoil" I said, " 'tis a strange name, and 
I wonder why 'tis called so; for if I were a king, I would have plants more 
bright in my garden". Still it smells sweet when bruised, does it not? If 
sweet is the right word: wholesome, maybe, is nearer.' 

'Wholesome verily,' said Aragorn. 'And now, dame, if you love the Ford 
Faramir, run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil, if there is a 
leaf in the City.' 

'And if not,' said Gandalf, 'I will ride to Fossarnach with Ioreth 
behind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters. And 
Shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste.' 

When Ioreth was gone, Aragorn bade the other women to make water hot. 
Then he took Faramir's hand in his, and laid the other hand upon the sick 
man's brow. It was drenched with sweat; but Faramir did not move or make any 




sign, and seemed hardly to breathe. 

'He is nearly spent,' said Aragorn turning to Gandalf. 'But this comes 
not from the wound. See! that is healing. Had he been smitten by some dart 
of the Nazgyl, as you thought, he would have died that night. This hurt was 
given by some Southron arrow, I would guess. Who drew it forth? Was it 
kept?' 

'I drew it forth,' said Imrahil, 'and staunched the wound. But I did 
not keep the arrow, for we had much to do. It was, as I remember, just such 
a dart as the Southrons use. Yet I believed that it came from the Shadows 
above, for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood; since the 
wound was not deep or vital. How then do you read the matter?' 

'Weariness, grief for his father's mood, a wound, and over all the 
Black Breath,' said Aragorn. 'He is a man of staunch will, for already he 
had come close under the Shadow before ever he rode to battle on the 
out- walls. Slowly the dark must have crept on him, even as he fought and 
strove to hold his outpost. Would that I could have been here sooner!' 

Thereupon the herb-master entered. 'Your lordship asked for kingsfoil, 
as the rustics name it, he said; or athelas in the noble tongue, or to those 
who know somewhat of the Valinorean. . .' 

'I do so,' said Aragorn, 'and I care not whether you say now asla 
aranion or kingsfoil, so long as you have some.' 

'Your pardon lord!' said the man. 'I see you are a lore-master, not 
merely a captain of war. But alas ! sir, we do not keep this thing in the 
Houses of Healing, where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended. For it 
has no virtue that we know of, save perhaps to sweeten a fouled air, or to 
drive away some passing heaviness. Unless, of course, you give heed to 
rhymes of old days which women such as our good Ioreth still repeat without 
understanding. 

When the black breath blows 
and death 's shadow grows 
and all lights pass, 
come athelas! come athelas! 

Life to the dying 
In the king's hand lying! 

It is but a doggrel, I fear, garbled in the memory of old wives. Its 
meaning I leave to your judgement, if indeed it has any. But old folk still 
use an infusion of the herb for headaches.' 




'Then in the name of the king, go and find some old man of less lore 
and more wisdom who keeps some in his house!' cried Gandalf. 

Now Aragorn knelt beside Faramir, and held a hand upon his brow. And 
those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on. For Aragorn's 
face grew grey with weariness; and ever and anon he called the name of 
Faramir, but each time more faintly to their hearing, as if Aragorn himself 
was removed from them, and walked afar in some dark vale, calling for one 
that was lost. 

And at last Bergil came running in, and he bore six leaves in a cloth. 

'It is kingsfoil, Sir,' he said; 'but not fresh, I fear. It must have been 
culled two weeks ago at the least. I hope it will serve, Sir?' Then looking 
at Faramir he burst into tears. 

But Aragorn smiled. 'It will serve,' he said. 'The worst is now over. 

Stay and be comforted!' Then taking two leaves, he laid them on his hands 
and breathed on them, and then he crushed them, and straightway a living 
freshness filled the room, as if the air itself awoke and tingled, sparkling 
with joy. And then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that 
were brought to him, and at once all hearts were lightened. For the 
fragrance that came to each was like a memory of dewy mornings of 
unshadowed 

sun in some land of which the fair world in Spring is itself but a fleeting 
memory. But Aragorn stood up as one refreshed, and his eyes smiled as he 
held a bowl before Faramir's dreaming face. 

'Well now! Who would have believed it?' said Ioreth to a woman that 
stood beside her. 'The weed is better than I thought. It reminds me of the 
roses of Imloth Melui when I was a lass, and no king could ask for better.' 

Suddenly Faramir stirred, and he opened his eyes, and he looked on 
Aragorn who bent over him; and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in 
his eyes, and he spoke softly. 'My lord, you called me. I come. What does 
the king command?' 

'Walk no more in the shadows, but awake!' said Aragorn. 'You are weary. 
Rest a while, and take food, and be ready when I return.' 

'I will, lord,' said Faramir. 'For who would lie idle when the king has 
returned?' 

'Farewell then for a while!' said Aragorn. 'I must go to others who 
need me.' And he left the chamber with Gandalf and Imrahil; but Beregond and 
his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy. As he followed Gandalf 




and shut the door Pippin heard Ioreth exclaim: 

'King! Did you hear that? What did I say? The hands of a healer, I 
said.’ And soon the word had gone out from the House that the king was 
indeed come among them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran 
through the City. 

But Aragorn came to Jowyn, and he said: 'Here there is a grievous hurt 
and a heavy blow. The arm that was broken has been tended with due skill, 
and it will mend in time, if she has the strength to live: It is the 
shield-arm that is maimed; but the chief evil comes through the sword-arm. 

In that there now seems no life, although it is unbroken. 

'Alas ! For she was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind 
or body. And those who will take a weapon to such an enemy must be sterner 
than steel, if the very shock shall not destroy them. It was an evil doom 
that set her in his path. For she is a fair maiden, fairest lady of a house 
of queens. And yet I know not how I should speak of her. When I first looked 
on her and perceived her unhappiness, it seemed to me that I saw a white 
flower standing straight and proud, shapely as a lily, and yet knew that it 
was hard, as if wrought by elf-wrights out of steel. Or was it, maybe, a 
frost that had turned its sap to ice, and so it stood, bitter-sweet, still 
fair to see, but stricken, soon to fall and die? Her malady begins far back 
before this day, does it not, Jomer?' 

'I marvel that you should ask me, lord,' he answered. 'For I hold you 
blameless in this matter, as in all else; yet I knew not that Jowyn, my 
sister, was touched by any frost, until she first looked on you. Care and 
dread she had, and shared with me, in the days of Wormtongue and the king's 
bewitchment; and she tended the king in growing fear. But that did not bring 
her to this pass!' 

'My friend,' said Gandalf, 'you had horses, and deeds of arms, and the 
free fields; but she, born in the body of a maid, had a spirit and courage 
at least the match of yours. Yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man, 
whom she loved as a father, and watch him falling into a mean dishonoured 
dotage; and her part seemed to her more ignoble than that of the staff he 
leaned on. 

'Think you that Wormtongue had poison only for Thjoden's ears? Dotard ! 
What is the house of Eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the 
reek, and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs? Have you not heard 




those words before? Saruman spoke them, the teacher of Wormtongue. Though 

I 

do not doubt that Wormtongue at home wrapped their meaning in terms 
more 

cunning. My lord, if your sister's love for you, and her will still bent to 
her duty, had not restrained her lips; you might have heard even such things 
as these escape them. But who knows what she spoke to the darkness, alone, 
in the bitter watches of the night, when all her life seemed shrinking, and 
the walls of her bower closing in about her, a hutch to trammel some wild 
thing in?' 

Then Jomer was silent, and looked on his sister, as if pondering anew 
all the days of their past life together. But Aragorn said: 'I saw also what 
you saw, Jomer. Few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have 
more bitterness and shame for a man's heart than to behold the love of a 
lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned Sorrow and pity have followed 
me ever since I left her desperate in Dunharrow and rode to the Paths of the 
Dead; and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might 
befall her. And yet, Jomer, I say to you that she loves you more truly than 
me; for you she loves and knows; but in me she loves only a shadow and a 
thought: a hope of glory and great deeds, and lands far from the fields of 
Rohan. 

'I have, maybe, the power to heal her body, and to recall her from the 
dark valley. But to what she will awake: hope, or forgetfulness, or despair, 

I do not know. And if to despair, then she will die, unless other healing 
comes which I cannot bring. Alas! for her deeds have set her among the 
queens of great renown.' 

Then Aragorn stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed white as 
a lily, cold as frost, and hard as graven stone. But he bent and kissed her 
on the brow, and called her softly, saying: 

'Jowyn Jomund's daughter, awake! For your enemy has passed away!' 

She did not stir, but now she began again to breathe deeply, so that 
her breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet. Once more 
Aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them into steaming water; and 
he laved her brow with it, and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the 
coverlet. 

Then, whether Aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of Westernesse, 
or whether it was but his words of the Lady Jowyn that wrought on them, as 




the sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those 
who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window, and it bore no scent, 
but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young, as if it had not before 
been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy 
mountains 

high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by 
seas of foam. 

'Awake, Jowyn, Lady of Rohan!' said Aragorn again, and he took her 
right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning. 'Awake! The shadow 
is gone and all darkness is washed clean!' Then he laid her hand in Jomer's 
and stepped away. 'Call her!' he said, and he passed silently from the 
chamber. 

'Jowyn, Jowyn!' cried Jomer amid his tears. But she opened her eyes and 
said: 'Jomer! What joy is this? For they said that you were slain. Nay, but 
that was only the dark voices in my dream. How long have I been dreaming?' 

'Not long, my sister,' said Jomer. 'But think no more on it!' 

' I am strangely weary,' she said. 'I must rest a little. But tell me, 
what of the Lord of the Mark? Alas! Do not tell me that that was a dream for 
I know that it was not. He is dead as he foresaw.' 

'He is dead,' said Jomer, 'but he bade me say farewell to Jowyn dearer 
than daughter. He lies now in great honour in the Citadel of Gondor.' 

'That is grievous,' she said. 'And yet it is good beyond all that I 
dared hope in the dark days, when it seemed that the House of Eorl was sunk 
in honour less than any shepherd's cot. And what of the king's esquire, the 
Halfling? Jomer, you shall make him a knight of the Riddermark, for he is 
valiant!' 

'He lies nearby in this House, and I will go to him,' said Gandalf. 

'Jomer shall stay here for a while. But do not speak yet of war or woe, 
until you are made whole again. Great gladness it is to see you wake again 
to health and hope, so valiant a lady!' 

'To health?' said Jowyn. It may be so. At least while there is an 
empty saddle of some fallen Rider that I can fill, and there are deeds to 
do. But to hope? I do not know.' 

Gandalf and Pippin came to Merry's room, and there they found Aragorn 
standing by the bed. 'Poor old Merry!' cried Pippin, and he ran to the 
bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness 
was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly 




a fear seized Pippin that Merry would die. 

'Do not be afraid,' said Aragorn. 'I came in time, and I have called 
him back. He is weary now, and grieved, and he has taken a hurt like the 
Lady Jowyn, daring to smite that deadly thing. But these evils can be 
amended, so strong and gay a spirit is in him. His grief he will not forget; 
but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.' 

Then Aragorn laid his hand on Merry's head, and passing his hand gently 
through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And 
when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room, like the scent of 
orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke, 
and he said: 

'I am hungry. What is the time?' 

'Past supper-time now,' said Pippin; 'though I daresay I could bring 
you something, if they will let me.' 

'They will indeed,' said Gandalf. 'And anything else that this Rider of 
Rohan may desire, if it can be found in Minas Tirith, where his name is in 
honour.' 

'Good!' said Merry. 'Then I would like supper first, and after that a 
pipe.' At that his face clouded. 'No, not a pipe. I don't think I'll smoke 
again.' 

'Why not?' said Pippin. 

'Well,' answered Merry slowly. 'He is dead. It has brought it all back 
to me. He said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb-lore 
with me. Almost the last thing he ever said. I shan't ever be able to smoke 
again without thinking of him, and that day, Pippin, when he rode up to 
Isengard and was so polite.' 

'Smoke then, and think of him!' said Aragorn. 'For he was a gentle 
heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to 
a last fair morning. Though your service to him was brief, it should be a 
memory glad and honourable to the end of your days.' 

Merry smiled. 'Well then,' he said, 'if Strider will provide what is 
needed, I will smoke and think. I had some of Saruman's best in my pack, but 
what became of it in the battle, I am sure I don't know.' 

'Master Meriadoc,' said Aragorn, 'if you think that I have passed 
through the mountains and the realm of Gondor with fire and sword to bring 
herbs to a careless soldier who throws away his gear, you are mistaken. If 
your pack has not been found, then you must send for the herb-master of this 




House. And he will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire 
had any virtues, but that it is called westmansweed by the vulgar, and 
galenas by the noble, and other names in other tongues more learned, and 
after adding a few half-forgotten rhymes that he does not understand, he 
will regretfully inform you that there is none in the House, and he will 
leave you to reflect on the history of tongues. And so now must I. For I 
have not slept in such a bed as this, since I rode from Dunharrow, nor eaten 
since the dark before dawn.' 

Merry seized his hand and kissed it. 'I am frightfully sorry,' he said. 

'Go at once! Ever since that night at Bree we have been a nuisance to you. 

But it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less 
than they mean. We fear to say too much. It robs us of the right words when 
a jest is out of place.' 

'I know that well, or I would not deal with you in the same way ' said 
Aragorn. 'May the Shire live for ever unwithered!' And kissing Merry he went 
out, and Gandalf went with him. 

Pippin remained behind. 'Was there ever any one like him?' he said. 
'Except Gandalf, of course. I think they must be related. My dear ass, your 
pack is lying by your bed, and you had it on your back when I met you. He 
saw it all the time, of course. And anyway I have some stuff of my own. Come 
on now! Longbottom Leaf it is. Fill up while I run and see about some food. 
And then let' s be easy for a bit. Dear me! We Tooks and Brandybucks, we 
can't live long on the heights.' 

'No,' said Merry. 'I can't. Not yet, at any rate. But at least, Pippin, 
we can now see them, and honour them. It is best to love first what you are 
fitted to love, I suppose: you must start somewhere and have some roots, and 
the soil of the Shire is deep. Still there are things deeper and higher; and 
not a gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace but for them, 
whether he knows about them or not. I am glad that I know about them, a 
little. But I don't know why I am talking like this. Where is that leaf? And 
get my pipe out of my pack, if it isn't broken.' 

Aragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of Healing, 
and they counselled him that Faramir and Jowyn should remain there and still 
be tended with care for many days. 

'The Lady Jowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but 
she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, 
until at least ten days be passed.' 




'As for Faramir,' said Gandalf, 'he must soon learn that his father is 
dead. But the full tale of the madness of Denethor should not be told to 
him, until he is quite healed and has duties to do. See that Beregond and 
the perian who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!' 

And the other perian Meriadoc who is under my care, what of him?' said 
the Warden. 

'It is likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow, for a short 
while,' said Aragorn. 'Let him do so, if he wishes. He may walk a little in 
the care of his friends.' 

'They are a remarkable race,' said the Warden, nodding his head. 'Very 
tough in the fibre, I deem.' 

At the doors of the Houses many were already gathered to see Aragorn, 
and they followed after him; and when at last he had supped, men came and 
prayed that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose lives were in 
peril through hurt or wound, or who lay under the Black Shadow. And 
Aragorn 

arose and went out, and he sent for the sons of Elrond, and together they 
laboured far into the night. And word went through the City: 'The King is 
come again indeed.' And they named him Elfstone, because of the green stone 
that he wore, and so the name which it was foretold at his birth that he 
should bear was chosen for him by his own people. 

And when he could labour no more, he cast his cloak about him, and 
slipped out of the City, and went to his tent just ere dawn and slept for a 
little. And in the morning the banner of Dol Amroth, a white ship like a 
swan upon blue water, floated from the Tower, and men looked up and 
wondered 

if the coming of the King had been but a dream. 




Chapter 9. The Last Debate 



The morning came after the day of battle, and it was fair with light 
clouds and the wind turning westward. Legolas and Gimli were early abroad, 
and they begged leave to go up into the City; for they were eager to see 
Merry and Pippin. 

'It is good to learn that they are still alive,' said Gimli; 'for they 
cost us great pains in our march over Rohan, and I would not have such pains 
all wasted.' 

Together the Elf and the Dwarf entered Minas Tirith, and folk that saw 
them pass marvelled to see such companions; for Legolas was fair of face 
beyond the measure of Men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he 
walked in the morning; but Gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and 
staring about him. 

'There is some good stone-work here,' he said as he looked at the 
walls; 'but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better 
contrived. When Aragorn comes into his own, I shall offer him the service of 
stone wrights of the Mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of.' 

'They need more gardens,' said Legolas. 'The houses are dead, and there 
is too little here that grows and is glad. If Aragorn comes into his own, 
the people of the Wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not 
die.' 

At length they came to the Prince Imrahil, and Legolas looked at him 
and bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven-blood in 
his veins. 'Hail, lord!' he said. 'It is long since the people of Nimrodel 
left the woodlands of Lurien, and yet still one may see that not all sailed 
from Amroth's haven west over water.' 

'So it is said in the lore of my land,' said the Prince; 'yet never has 
one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count. And I marvel to 
see one here now in the midst of sorrow and war. What do you seek?' 

'I am one of the Nine Companions who set out with Mithrandir from 
Imladris, said Legolas and with this Dwarf, my friend, I came with the Lord 
Aragorn. But now we wish to see our friends. Meriadoc and Peregrin, who are 
in your keeping, we are told.' 

'You will find them in the Houses of Healing, and I will lead you 




thither,' said Imrahil. 

'It will be enough if you send one to guide us, lord,' said Legolas. 

'For Aragorn sends this message to you. He does not wish to enter the City 
again at this time. Yet there is need for the captains to hold council at 
once, and he prays that you and Jomer of Rohan will come down to his tents, 
as soon as may be. Mithrandir is already there.' 

'We will come,' said Imrahil; and they parted with courteous words. 

'That is a fair lord and a great captain of men,' said Legolas. 'If 
Gondor has such men still in these days of fading, great must have been its 
glory in the days of its rising.' 

'And doubtless the good stone-work is the older and was wrought in the 
first building,' said Gimli. 'It is ever so with the things that Men begin: 
there is a frost in Spring, or a blight in Summer, and they fail of their 
promise.' 

'Yet seldom do they fail of their seed,' said Legolas. 'And that will 
lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked-for. 

The deeds of Men will outlast us, Gimli.' 

'And yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens, I guess,' said 
the Dwarf. 

'To that the Elves know not the answer,' said Legolas. 

With that the servant of the Prince came and led them to the Houses of 
Healing; and there they found their friends in the garden, and their meeting 
was a merry one. For a while they walked and talked, rejoicing for a brief 
space in peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of 
the City. Then when Merry became weary, they went and sat upon the wall 
with 

the greensward of the Houses of Healing behind them; and away southward 
before them was the Anduin glittering in the sun, as it flowed away, out of 
the sight even of Legolas, into the wide flats and green haze of Lebennin 
and South Ithilien. 

And now Legolas fell silent, while the others talked, and he looked out 
against the sun, and as he gazed he saw white sea-birds beating up the 
River. 

'Look!' he cried. 'Gulls! They are flying far inland. A wonder they are 
to me and a trouble to my heart. Never in all my life had I met them, until 
we came to Pelargir, and there I heard them crying in the air as we rode to 
the battle of the ships. Then I stood still, forgetting war in Middle-earth; 




for their wailing voices spoke to me of the Sea. The Sea! Alas! I have not 
yet beheld it. But deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the 
sea-longing, which it is perilous to stir. Alas! for the gulls. No peace 
shall I have again under beech or under elm.' 

’Say not so!' said Gimli. 'There are countless things still to see in 
Middle-earth, and great works to do. But if all the fair folk take to the 
Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.' 

'Dull and dreary indeed!' said Merry: 'You must not go to the Havens, 
Legolas. There will always be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise 
dwarves like Gimli, who need you. At least I hope so. Though I feel somehow 
that the worst of this war is still to come. How I wish it was all over, and 
well over!' 

'Don't be so gloomy!' cried Pippin. 'The Sun is shining, and here we 
are together for a day or two at least. I want to hear more about you all. 

Come, Gimli! You and Legolas have mentioned your strange journey with 
Strider about a dozen times already this morning. But you haven't told me 
anything about it.' 

'The Sun may shine here,' said Gimli, 'but there are memories of that 
road that I do not wish to recall out of the darkness. Had I known what was 
before me, I think that not for any friendship would I have taken the Paths 
of the Dead.' 

'The Paths of the Dead?' said Pippin. 'I heard Aragorn say that and I 
wondered what he could mean. Won't you tell us some more?' 

'Not willingly,' said Gimli. 'For upon that road I was put to shame: 

Gimli Gluin's son, who had deemed himself more tough than Men, and 
hardier 

under earth than any Elf. But neither did I prove; and I was held to the 
road only by the will of Aragorn.' 

'And by the love of him also,' said Legolas. 'For all those who come to 
know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the 
Rohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we 
left Dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on 
our going, save the Lady Jowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below. There 
was grief at that parting, and I was grieved to behold it.' 

'Alas! I had heart only for myself,' said Gimli. 'Nay! I will not speak 
of that journey.' 

He fell silent; but Pippin and Merry were so eager for news that at 




last Legolas said: 'I will tell you enough for your peace; for I felt not 
the horror, and I feared not the shadows of Men, powerless and frail as I 
deemed them.' 

Swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the 
dark tryst at Erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to 
Pelargir on Anduin. 'Four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from 
the Black Stone,' he said. 'And lo! in the darkness of Mordor my hope rose; 
for in that gloom the Shadow Host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible 
to look upon. Some I saw riding, some striding, yet all moving with the same 
great speed. Silent they were, but there was a gleam in their eyes. In the 
uplands of Lamedon they overtook our horses, and swept round us, and would 
have passed us by, if Aragorn had not forbidden them. 

'At his command they fell back. "Even the shades of Men are obedient to 
his will," I thought. "They may serve his needs yet! " 

'One day of light we rode, and then came the day without dawn, and 
still we rode on, and Ciril and Ringlu we crossed; and on the third day we 
came to Linhir above the mouth of Gilrain. And there men of Lamedon 
contested the fords with fell folk of Umbar and Harad who had sailed up the 
river. But defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and fled when we 
came, crying out that the King of the Dead was upon them. Only Angbor, Lord 
of Lamedon, had the heart to abide us; and Aragorn bade him gather his folk 
and come behind, if they dared, when the Grey Host had passed. 

' "At Pelargir the Heir of Isildur will have need of you," he said. 

'Thus we crossed over Gilrain, driving the allies of Mordor in rout 
before us; and then we rested a while. But soon Aragorn arose, saying: "Lo! 
already Minas Tirith is assailed. I fear that it will fall ere we come to 
its aid." So we mounted again before night had passed and went on with all 
the speed that our horses could endure over the plains of Lebennin.' 

Legolas paused and sighed, and turning his eyes southward softly he 
sang: 

Silver flow the streams from Celos to Erui 
In the green fields of Lebennin! 

Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea 
The white lilies sway, 

And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin 
In the green fields of Lebennin, 

In the wind from the Sea! 




'Green are those fields in the songs of my people; but they were dark 
then, grey wastes in the blackness before us. And over the wide land, 
trampling unheeded the grass and the flowers, we hunted our foes through a 
day and a night, until we came at the bitter end to the Great River at last. 

Then I thought in my heart that we drew near to the Sea; for wide was 
the water in the darkness, and sea-birds innumerable cried on its, shores. 

Alas for the wailing of the gulls ! Did not the Lady tell me to beware of 
them? And now I cannot forget them.' 

’For my part I heeded them not,' said Gimli; 'for we came then at last 
upon battle in earnest. There at Pelargir lay the main fleet of Umbar, fifty 
great ships and smaller vessels beyond count. Many of those that we pursued 
had reached the havens before us, and brought their fear with them; and some 
of the ships had put off, seeking to escape down the River or to reach the 
far shore; and many of the smaller craft were ablaze. But the Haradrim, 
being now driven to the brink, turned at bay, and they were fierce in 
despair; and they laughed when they looked on us, for they were a great army 
still. 

'But Aragorn halted and cried with a great voice: "Now come! By the 
Black Stone I call you! " And suddenly the Shadow Host that had hung back at 
the last came up like a grey tide, sweeping all away before it. Faint cries 
I heard, and dim horns blowing, and a murmur as of countless far voices: it 
was like the echo of some forgotten battle in the Dark Years long ago. Pale 
swords were drawn; but I know not whether their blades would still bite, for 
the Dead needed no longer any weapon but fear. None would withstand them. 

'To every ship they came that was drawn up, and then they passed over 
the water to those that were anchored; and all the mariners were filled with 
a madness of terror and leaped overboard, save the slaves chained to the 
oars. Reckless we rode among our fleeing foes, driving them like leaves, 
until we came to the shore. And then to each of the great ships that 
remained Aragorn sent one of the D®nedain, and they comforted the captives 
that were aboard, and bade them put aside fear and be free. 

'Ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were left to resist us all 
were drowned, or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon 
foot. Strange and wonderful I thought it that the designs of Mordor should 
be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness. With its own weapons was 
it worsted!' 

'Strange indeed,' said Legolas. 'In that hour I looked on Aragorn and 




thought how great and terrible a Lord he might have become in the strength 
of his will, had he taken the Ring to himself. Not for naught does Mordor 
fear him. But nobler is his spirit than the understanding of Sauron; for is 
he not of the children of L®thien? Never shall that line fail, though the 
years may lengthen beyond count.' 

'Beyond the eyes of the Dwarves are such foretellings,' said Gimli. 

'But mighty indeed was Aragorn that day. Lo! all the black fleet was in his 
hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it. 
Then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy; and 
the Shadow Host withdrew to the shore. There they stood silent, hardly to be 
seen, save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships 
that were burning. And Aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the Dead Men, 
crying: 

' "Hear now the words of the Heir of Isildur! Your oath is fulfilled. 

Go back and trouble not the valleys ever again! Depart and be at rest! " 

'And thereupon the King of the Dead stood out before the host and broke 
his spear and cast it down. Then he bowed low and turned away; and swiftly 
the whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is driven back by 
a sudden wind; and it seemed to me that I awoke from a dream. 

'That night we rested while others laboured. For there were many 
captives set free, and many slaves released who had been folk of Gondor 
taken in raids; and soon also there was a great gathering of men out of 
Lebennin and the Ethir, and Angbor of Lamedon came up with all the 
horsemen 

that he could muster. Now that the fear of the Dead was removed they came to 
aid us and to look on the Heir of Isildur; for the rumour of that name had 
run like fire in the dark. 

'And that is near the end of our tale. For during that evening and 
night many ships were made ready and manned; and in the morning the fleet 
set forth. Long past it now seems, yet it was but the morn of the day ere 
yesterday, the sixth since we rode from Dunharrow. But still Aragorn was 
driven by fear that time was too short. 

' "It is forty leagues and two from Pelargir to the landings at the 
Harlond," he said. "Yet to the Harlond we must come tomorrow or fail 
utterly." 

'The oars were now wielded by free men, and manfully they laboured; yet 
slowly we passed up the Great River, for we strove against its stream, and 




though that is not swift down in the South, we had no help of wind. Heavy 
would my heart have been, for all our victory at the havens, if Legolas had 
not laughed suddenly. 

' "Up with your beard, Durin's son! " he said. "For thus is it spoken: 

Oft hope is born, when all is forlorn." But what hope he saw from afar he 
would not tell. When night came it did but deepen the darkness, and our 
hearts were hot, for away in the North we saw a red glow under the cloud, 
and Aragorn said: "Minas Tirith is burning." 

’But at midnight hope was indeed born anew. Sea -crafty men of the Ethir 
gazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the Sea. 
Long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail; and our speed grew, until dawn 
whitened the foam at our prows. And so it was, as you know, that we came in 
the third hour of the morning with a fair wind and the Sun unveiled, and we 
unfurled the great standard in battle. It was a great day and a great hour, 
whatever may come after.' 

’Follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,' said Legolas. 
’Great deed was the riding of the Paths of the Dead, and great it shall 
remain, though none be left in Gondor to sing of it in the days that are to 
come.' 

'And that may well befall,' said Gimli. 'For the faces of Aragorn and 
Gandalf are grave. Much I wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents 
there below. For my part, like Merry, I wish that with our victory the war 
was now over. Yet whatever is still to do, I hope to have a part in it, for 
the honour of the folk of the Lonely Mountain.' 

'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love 
of the Lord of the White Tree.' 

Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high 
place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. 

When the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at once he 
sent for Jomer; and he went down with him from the City, and they came to 
the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place 
where King Thjoden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with 
Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond. 

'My lords,' said Gandalf, 'listen to the words of the Steward of Gondor 
before he died: You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor for a day, but 
against the Power that has now arisen there is no victory. I do not bid you 
despair, as he did, but to ponder the truth in these words. 




The Stones of Seeing do not lie, and not even the Lord of Barad-dyr 
can make them do so. He can, maybe, by his will choose what things shall be 
seen by weaker minds, or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see. 
Nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when Denethor saw great forces arrayed 
against him in Mordor, and more still being gathered, he saw that which 
truly is. 

'Hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great assault. 

The next will be greater. This war then is without final hope, as Denethor 
perceived. Victory cannot be achieved by arms, whether you sit here to 
endure siege after siege, or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the River. 
You have only a choice of evils; and prudence would counsel you to 
strengthen such strong places as you have, and there await the onset; for so 
shall the time before your end be made a little longer.' 

'Then you would have us retreat to Minas Tirith, or Dol Amroth, or to 
Dunharrow, and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is 
flowing?' said Imrahil. 

'That would be no new counsel,' said Gandalf. 'Have you not done this 
and little more in all the days of Denethor? But no! I said this would be 
prudent. I do not counsel prudence. I said victory could not be achieved by 
arms. I still hope for victory, but not by arms. For into the midst of all 
these policies comes the Ring of Power, the foundation of Barad-dyr, and the 
hope of Sauron. 

'Concerning this thing, my lords, you now all know enough for the 
understanding of our plight, and of Sauron' s. If he regains it, your valour 
is vain, and his victory will be swift and complete: so complete that none 
can foresee the end of it while this world lasts. If it is destroyed, then 
he will fall; and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising 
ever again. For he will lose the best part of the strength that was native 
to him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will 
crumble, and he will be maimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice 
that gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape. And 
so a great evil of this world will be removed. 

'Other evils there are that may come; for Sauron is himself but a 
servant or emissary. Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the 
world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are 
set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live 
after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours 




to rule. 

'Now Sauron knows all this, and he knows that this precious thing which 
he lost has been found again; but he does not yet know where it is, or so we 
hope. And therefore he is now in great doubt. For if we have found this 
thing, there are some among us with strength enough to wield it. That too he 
knows. For do I not guess rightly, Aragorn, that you have shown yourself to 
him in the Stone of Orthanc?' 

'I did so ere I rode from the Flornburg,' answered Aragorn. 'I deemed 
that the time was ripe, and that the Stone had come to me for just such a 
purpose. It was then ten days since the Ring-bearer went east from Rauros, 
and the Eye of Sauron, I thought, should be drawn out from his own land. Too 
seldom has he been challenged since he returned to his Tower. Though if I 
had foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer, maybe I should not have 
dared to show myself. Bare time was given me to come to your aid.' 

'But how is this?' asked Jomer. 'All is vain, you say, if he has the 
Ring. Why should he think it not vain to assail us, if we have it?' 

'He is not yet sure,' said Gandalf, 'and he has not built up his power 
by waiting until his enemies are secure, as we have done. Also we could not 
learn how to wield the full power all in a day. Indeed it can be used only 
by one master alone, not by many; and he will look for a time of strife, ere 
one of the great among us makes himself master and puts down the others. In 
that time the Ring might aid him, if he were sudden. 

'He is watching. He sees much and hears much. His Nazgyl are still 
abroad. They passed over this field ere the sunrise, though few of the weary 
and sleeping were aware of them. He studies the signs: the Sword that robbed 
him of his treasure re-made; the winds of fortune turning in our favour, and 
the defeat unlooked-for of his first assault the fall of his great Captain. 

'His doubt will be growing, even as we speak here. His Eye is now 
straining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. So we must 
keep it. Therein lies all our hope. This, then, is my counsel. We have not 
the Ring. In wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed, 
lest it destroy us. Without it we cannot by force defeat his force. But we 
must at all costs keep his Eye from his true peril. We cannot achieve 
victory by arms, but by arms we can give the Ring-bearer his only chance, 
frail though it be. 

'As Aragorn has begun, so we must go on. We must push Sauron to his 
last throw. We must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his 




land. We must march out to meet him at once. We must make ourselves the 
bait, though his jaws should close on us. He will take that bait, in hope 
and in greed, for he will think that in such rashness he sees the pride of 
the new Ringlord: and he will say: "So! he pushes out his neck too soon and 
too far. Let him come on, and behold I will have him in a trap from which he 
cannot escape. There I will crush him, and what he has taken in his 
insolence shall be mine again for ever." 

'We must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope 
for ourselves. For, my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall 
perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if 
Barad-dyr be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age. But this, I 
deem, is our duty. And better so than to perish nonetheless - as we surely 
shall, if we sit here - and know as we die that no new age shall be.' 

They were silent for a while. At length Aragorn spoke. 'As I have 
begun, so I will go on. We come now to the very brink, where hope and 
despair are akin. To waver is to fall. Let none now reject the counsels of 
Gandalf, whose long labours against Sauron come at last to their test. But 
for him all would long ago have been lost. Nonetheless I do not yet claim to 
command any man. Let others choose as they will.' 

Then said Elrohir: 'From the North we came with this purpose, and from 
Elrond our father we brought this very counsel. We will not turn back.' 

'As for myself,' said Jomer, 'I have little knowledge of these deep 
matters; but I need it not. This I know, and it is enough, that as my friend 
Aragorn succoured me and my people, so I will aid him when he calls. I will 

go-’ 

'As for me,' said Imrahil, 'the Lord Aragorn I hold to be my 
liege-lord, whether he claim it or no. His wish is to me a command. I will 
go also. Yet for a while I stand in the place of the Steward of Gondor, and 
it is mine to think first of its people. To prudence some heed must still be 
given. For we must prepare against all chances, good as well as evil. Now, 
it may be that we shall triumph, and while there is any hope of this, Gondor 
must be protected. I would not have us return with victory to a City in 
ruins and a land ravaged behind us. And yet we learn from the Rohirrim that 
there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank.' 

'That is true,' said Gandalf. 'I do not counsel you to leave the City 
all unmanned. Indeed the force that we lead east need not be great enough 
for any assault in earnest upon Mordor, so long as it be great enough to 




challenge battle. And it must move soon. Therefore I ask the Captains: what 
force could we muster and lead out in two days' time at the latest? And they 
must be hardy men that go willingly, knowing their peril.' 

'All are weary, and very many have wounds light or grievous,' said 
Jomer, 'and we have suffered much loss of our horses, and that is ill to 
bear. If we must ride soon, then I cannot hope to lead even two thousands, 
and yet leave as many for the defence of the City.' 

'We have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field ' said 
Aragorn. 'New strength is on the way from the southern fiefs, now that the 
coasts have been rid. Four thousands I sent marching from Pelargir through 
Lossarnach two days ago; and Angbor the fearless rides before them. If we 
set out in two days more, they will draw nigh ere we depart. Moreover many 
were bidden to follow me up the River in any craft they could gather; and 
with this wind they will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already 
come to the Harlond. I judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse 
and foot, and yet leave the City in better defence than it was when the 
assault began.' 

'The Gate is destroyed,' said Imrahil, 'and where now is the skill to 
rebuild it and set it up anew?' 

'In Erebor in the Kingdom of Dbin there is such skill,' said Aragorn; 

'and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send Gimli Gluin's 
son to ask for wrights of the Mountain. But men are better than gates, and 
no gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it.' 

This then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set 
forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if these 
might be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because 
of the evil lands into which they would go. Aragorn should find some two 
thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the South; but Imrahil 
should find three and a half thousands; and Jomer five hundreds of the 
Rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself 
should 

lead five hundreds of his best Riders on horse; and another company of five 
hundred horse there should be, among which should ride the sons of Elrond 
with the D®nedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand foot 
and a thousand horse. But the main strength of the Rohirrim that remained 
horsed and able to fight, some three thousand under the command of Elfhelm, 
should waylay the West Road against the enemy that was in Anurien. And at 




once swift riders were sent out to gather what news they could northwards; 
and eastwards from Osgiliath and the road to Minas Morgul. 

And when they had reckoned up all their strength and taken thought for 
the journeys they should make and the roads they should choose, Imrahil 
suddenly laughed aloud. 

’Surely,' he cried, 'this is the greatest jest in all the history of 
Gondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the 
vanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and 
the impenetrable gate of the Black Land! So might a child threaten a 
mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow! If the Dark Lord 
knows so much as you say, Mithrandir, will he not rather smile than fear, 
and with his little finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him?' 

'No, he will try to trap the fly and take the sting,' said Gandalf. 

'And there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand mail-clad 
knights apiece. No, he will not smile.' 

'Neither shall we,' said Aragorn. 'If this be jest, then it is too 
bitter for laughter. Nay, it is the last move in a great jeopardy, and for 
one side or the other it will bring the end of the game.' Then he drew 
And®ril and held it up glittering in the sun. 'You shall not be sheathed 
again until the last battle is fought;' he said. 




Chapter 10. The Black Gate Opens 



Two days later the army of the West was all assembled on the Pelennor. 
The host of Ores and Easterlings had turned back out of Anurien, but harried 
and scattered by the Rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting 
towards Cair Andros; and with that threat destroyed and new strength 
arriving out of the South the City was as well manned as might be. Scouts 
reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the 
Cross-roads of the Fallen King. All now was ready for the last throw. 

Legolas and Gimli were to ride again together in the company of Aragorn 
and Gandalf, who went in the van with the D®nedain and the sons of Elrond. 
But Merry to his shame was not to go with them. 

'You are not fit for such a journey,' said Aragorn. 'But do not be 
ashamed. If you do no more in this war, you have already earned great 
honour. Peregrin shall go and represent the Shirefolk; and do not grudge him 
his chance of peril, for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed 
him, he has yet to match your deed. But in truth all now are in like danger. 
Though it may be our part to find bitter end before the Gate of Mordor, if 
we do so, then you will come also to a last stand, either here or wherever 
the black tide overtakes you. Farewell!' 

And so despondently Merry now stood and watched the mustering of the 
army. Bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to 
march leading a company of the Men of the City: he could not rejoin the 
Guard until his case was judged. In that same company Pippin was also to go, 
as a soldier of Gondor. Merry could see him not far off, a small but upright 
figure among the tall men of Minas Tirith. 

At last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. Troop by troop, 
and company by company, they wheeled and went off eastward. And long 
after 

they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the Causeway, Merry 
stood there. The last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled 
and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling 
friendless and alone. Everyone that he cared for had gone away into the 
gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky; and little hope at all was 
left in his heart that he would ever see any of them again. 




As if recalled by his mood of despair, the pain in his arm returned, 
and he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. He was roused by the 
touch of Bergil's hand. 

’Come, Master Perian!' said the lad. 'You are still in pain, I see. I 
will help you back to the Healers. But do not fear! They will come back. The 
Men of Minas Tirith will never be overcome. And now they have the Lord 
Elf stone, and Beregond of the Guard too.' 

Ere noon the army came to Osgiliath. There all the workers and 
craftsmen that could be spared were busy. Some were strengthening the 
ferries and boat-bridges that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when 
they fled; some gathered stores and booty; and others on the eastern side 
across the River were throwing up hasty works of defence. 

The vanguard passed on through the ruins of Old Gondor, and over the 
wide River, and on up the long straight road that in the high days had been 
made to run from the fair Tower of the Sun to the tall Tower of the Moon, 
which now was Minas Morgul in its accursed vale. Five miles beyond Osgiliath 
they halted, ending their first day's march. 

But the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came to the 
Cross-roads and the great ring of trees, and all was silent. No sign of any 
enemy had they seen, no cry or call had been heard, no shaft had sped from 
rock or thicket by the way, yet ever as they went forward they felt the 
watchfulness of the land increase. Tree and stone, blade and leaf were 
listening. The darkness had been dispelled, and far away westward sunset was 
on the Vale of Anduin, and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the 
blue air; but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the Ephel D®ath. 

Then Aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the 
ring of trees, and they blew a great fanfare, and the heralds cried aloud: 

'The Lords of Gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they 
take back.' The hideous ore-head that was set upon the carven figure was 
cast down and broken in pieces, and the old king's head was raised and set 
in its place once more, still crowned with white and golden flowers: and men 
laboured to wash and pare away all the foul scrawls that ores had put upon 
the stone. 

Now in their debate some had counselled that Minas Morgul should first 
be assailed, and if they might take it, it should be utterly destroyed. 

'And, maybe,' said Imrahil, 'the road that leads thence to the pass above 
will prove an easier way of assault upon the Dark Lord than his northern 




gate.' 

But against this Gandalf had spoken urgently, because of the evil that 
dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and 
horror, and because also of the news that Faramir had brought. For if the 
Ring-bearer had indeed attempted that way, then above all they should not 
draw the Eye of Mordor thither. So the next day when the main host came up, 
they set a strong guard upon the Cross-roads to make some defence, if Mordor 
should send a force over the Morgul Pass, or should bring more men up from 
the South. For that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of 
Ithilien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about the meeting of the 
ways. But Gandalf and Aragorn rode with the vanguard to the entrance of 
Morgul Vale and looked on the evil city. 

It was dark and lifeless; for the Ores and lesser creatures of Mordor 
that had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle, and the Nazgyl were 
abroad. Yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity. Then they 
broke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome fields and departed. 

The day after, being the third day since they set out from Minas 
Tirith, the army began its northward march along the road. It was some 
hundred miles by that way from the Cross-roads to the Morannon, and what 
might befall them before they came so far none knew They went openly but 
heedfully, with mounted scouts before them on the road, and others on foot 
upon either side, especially on the eastward flank; for there lay dark 
thickets, and a tumbled land of rocky ghylls and crags, behind which the 
long grim slopes of the Ephel D®ath clambered up. The weather of the world 
remained fair and the wind held in the west, but nothing could waft away the 
glooms and the sad mists that clung about the Mountains of Shadow; and 
behind them at whiles great smokes would arise and hover in the upper winds. 

Ever and anon Gandalf let blow the trumpets, and the heralds would cry: 
"The Lords of Gondor are come! Let all leave this land or yield them up!' 
But Imrahil said: 'Say not The Lords of Gondor. Say The King Elessar. For 
that is true, even though he has not yet sat upon the throne; and it will 
give the Enemy more thought, if the heralds use that name.' And thereafter 
thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the King Elessar. But none 
answered the challenge. 

Nonetheless, though they marched in seeming peace, the hearts of all 
the army, from the highest to the lowest, were downcast, and with every mile 
that they went north foreboding of evil grew heavier on them. It was near 




the end of the second day of their march from the Cross-roads that they 
first met any offer of battle. For a strong force of Ores and Easterlings 
attempted to take their leading companies in an ambush; and that was in the 
very place where Faramir had waylaid the men of Flarad, and the road went in 
a deep cutting through an out-thrust of the eastward hills. But the Captains 
of the West were well warned by their scouts, skilled men from Henneth 
Annyn 

led by Mablung; and so the ambush was itself trapped. For horsemen went 
wide 

about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind, and 
they were destroyed or driven east into the hills. 

But the victory did little to enhearten the captains. 'It is but a 
feint,' said Aragorn; 'and its chief purpose, I deem, was rather to draw us 
on by a false guess of our Enemy's weakness than to do us much hurt, yet.' 
And from that evening onward the Nazgyl came and followed every move of 
the 

army. They still flew high and out of sight of all save Legolas, and yet 
their presence could be felt, as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the 
sun; and though the Ring wraiths did not yet stoop low upon their foes and 
were silent, uttering no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off. 

So time and the hopeless journey wore away. Upon the fourth day from 
the Cross-roads and the sixth from Minas Tirith they came at last to the end 
of the living lands, and began to pass into the desolation that lay before 
the gates of the Pass of Cirith Gorgor; and they could descry the marshes 
and the desert that stretched north and west to the Emyn Muil. So desolate 
were those places and so deep the horror that lay on them that some of the 
host were unmanned, and they could neither walk nor ride further north. 

Aragorn looked at them, and there was pity in his eyes rather than 
wrath; for these were young men from Rohan, from Westfold far away, or 
husbandmen from Lossarnach, and to them Mordor had been from childhood 
a 

name of evil, and yet unreal, a legend that had no part in their simple 
life; and now they walked like men in a hideous dream made true, and they 
understood not this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass. 

'Go!' said Aragorn. 'But keep what honour you may, and do not run! And 
there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shamed. Take your 
way south-west till you come to Cair Andros, and if that is still held by 




enemies, as I think, then re-take it, if you can; and hold it to the last in 
defence of Gondor and Rohan!' 

Then some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and went on, 
and the others took new hope, hearing of a manful deed within their measure 
that they could turn to, and they departed. And so, since many men had 
already been left at the Cross-roads, it was with less than six thousands 
that the Captains of the West came at last to challenge the Black Gate and 
the might of Mordor. 

They advanced now slowly, expecting at every hour some answer to their 
challenge, and they drew together, since it was but waste of men to send out 
scouts or small parties from the main host. At nightfall of the fifth day of 
the march from Morgul Vale they made their last camp, and set fires about it 
of such dead wood and heath as they could find. They passed the hours of 
night in wakefulness and they were aware of many things half-seen that 
walked and prowled all about them, and they heard the howling of wolves. The 
wind had died and all the air seemed still. They could see little, for 
though it was cloudless and the waxing moon was four nights old, there were 
smokes and fumes that rose out of the earth and the white crescent was 
shrouded in the mists of Mordor. 

It grew cold. As morning came the wind began to stir again, but now it 
came from the North, and soon it freshened to a rising breeze. All the 
night-walkers were gone, and the land seemed empty. North amid their 
noisome 

pits lay the first of the great heaps and hills of slag and broken rock and 
blasted earth, the vomit of the maggot-folk of Mordor; but south and now 
near loomed the great rampart of Cirith Gorgor, and the Black Gate amidmost, 
and the two Towers of the Teeth tall and dark upon either side. For in their 
last march the Captains had turned away from the old road as it bent east, 
and avoided the peril of the lurking hills, and so now they were approaching 
the Morannon from the north-west, even as Frodo had done. 

The two vast iron doors of the Black Gate under its frowning arch were 
fast closed. Upon the battlement nothing could be seen. All was silent but 
watchful. They were come to the last end of their folly, and stood forlorn 
and chill in the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their 
army could not assault with hope, not even if it had brought thither engines 
of great power, and the Enemy had no more force than would suffice for the 
manning of the gate and wall alone. Yet they knew that all the hills and 




rocks about the Morannon were filled with hidden foes, and the shadowy 
defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things. And 
as they stood they saw all the Nazgyl gathered together, hovering above the 
Towers of the Teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were watched. But 
still the Enemy made no sign. 

No choice was left them but to play their part to its end. Therefore 
Aragorn now set the host in such array as could best be contrived; and they 
were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that ores had 
piled in years of labour. Before them towards Mordor lay like a moat a great 
mire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools. When all was ordered, the 
Captains rode forth towards the Black Gate with a great guard of horsemen 
and the banner and heralds and trumpeters. There was Gandalf as chief 
herald, and Aragorn with the sons of Elrond, and Jomer of Rohan, and 
Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to go also, so that 
all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness. 

They came within cry of the Morannon, and unfurled the banner, and blew 
upon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over 
the battlement of Mordor. 

'Come forth!' they cried. 'Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! 
Justice shall be done upon him. Lor wrongfully he has made war upon Gondor 
and wrested its lands. Therefore the King of Gondor demands that he should 
atone for his evils, and depart then for ever. Come forth!' 

There was a long silence, and from wall and gate no cry or sound was 
heard in answer. But Sauron had already laid his plans, and he had a mind 
first to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill. So it was that, 
even as the Captains were about to turn away, the silence was broken 
suddenly. There came a long rolling of great drums like thunder in the 
mountains, and then a braying of horns that shook the very stones and 
stunned men's ears. And thereupon the middle door of the Black Gate was 
thrown open with a great clang, and out of it there came an embassy from the 
Dark Tower. 

At its head there rode a tall and evil shape, mounted upon a black 
horse, if horse it was; for it was huge and hideous, and its face was a 
frightful mask, more like a skull than a living head, and in the sockets of 
its eyes and in its nostrils there burned a flame. The rider was robed all 
in black, and black was his lofty helm; yet this was no Ringwraith but a 
living man. The Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-dyr he was, and his name is 




remembered in no tale; for he himself had forgotten it, and he said: 'I am 
the Mouth of Sauron.' But it is told that he was a renegade, who came of the 
race of those that are named the Black N®menureans; for they established 
their dwellings in Middle-earth during the years of Sauron's domination, and 
they worshipped him, being enamoured of evil knowledge. And he entered the 
service of the Dark Tower when it first rose again, and because of his 
cunning he grew ever higher in the Lord's favour; and he learned great 
sorcery, and knew much of the mind of Sauron; and he was more cruel than 
any 
ore. 

He it was that now rode out, and with him came only a small company of 
black-harnessed soldiery, and a single banner, black but bearing on it in 
red the Evil Eye. Now halting a few paces before the Captains of the West he 
looked them up and down and laughed. 

'Is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me?' he 
asked. 'Or indeed with wit to understand me? Not thou at least!' he mocked, 
turning to Aragorn with scorn. 'It needs more to make a king than a piece of 
elvish glass, or a rabble such as this. Why, any brigand of the hills can 
show as good a following!' 

Aragorn said naught in answer, but he took the other's eye and held it, 
and for a moment they strove thus; but soon, though Aragorn did not stir nor 
move hand to weapon, the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a 
blow. 'I am a herald and ambassador, and may not be assailed!' he cried. 

'Where such laws hold,' said Gandalf, 'it is also the custom for 
ambassadors to use less insolence. But no one has threatened you. You have 
naught to fear from us, until your errand is done. But unless your master 
has come to new wisdom, then with all his servants you will be in great 
peril.' 

'So!' said the Messenger. 'Then thou art the spokesman, old greybeard? 

Have we not heard of thee at whiles, and of thy wanderings, ever hatching 
plots and mischief at a safe distance? But this time thou hast stuck out thy 
nose too far, Master Gandalf; and thou shalt see what comes to him who sets 
his foolish webs before the feet of Sauron the Great. I have tokens that I 
was bidden to show to thee - to thee in especial, if thou shouldst dare to 
come.' He signed to one of his guards, and he came forward bearing a bundle 
swathed in black cloths. 

The Messenger put these aside, and there to the wonder and dismay of 




all the Captains he held up first the short sword that Sam had carried, and 
next a grey cloak with an el ven -brooch, and last the coat of mithril-mail 
that Frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments. A blackness came 
before their eyes, and it seemed to them in a moment of silence that the 
world stood still, but their hearts were dead and their last hope gone. 

Pippin who stood behind Prince Imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief. 

’Silence!' said Gandalf sternly, thrusting him back; but the Messenger 
laughed aloud. 

’So you have yet another of these imps with you!' he cried. 'What use 
you find in them I cannot guess; but to send them as spies into Mordor is 
beyond even your accustomed folly. Still, I thank him, for it is plain that 
this brat at least has seen these tokens before, and it would be vain for 
you to deny them now.' 

'I do not wish to deny them,' said Gandalf. 'Indeed, I know them all 
and all their history, and despite your scorn, foul Mouth of Sauron, you 
cannot say as much. But why do you bring them here?' 

'Dwarf-coat, elf-cloak, blade of the downf alien West, and spy from the 
little rat-land of the Shire-nay; do not start! We know it well - here are 
the marks of a conspiracy. Now, maybe he that bore these things was a 
creature that you would not grieve to lose, and maybe otherwise: one dear to 
you, perhaps? If so, take swift counsel with what little wit is left to you. 

For Sauron does not love spies, and what his fate shall be depends now on 
your choice.' 

No one answered him; but he saw their faces grey with fear and the 
horror in their eyes, and he laughed again, for it seemed to him that his 
sport went well. 'Good, good!' he said. 'He was dear to you, I see. Or else 
his errand was one that you did not wish to fail? It has. And now he shall 
endure the slow torment of years, as long and slow as our arts in the Great 
Tower can contrive, and never be released, unless maybe when he is changed 
and broken, so that he may come to you, and you shall see what you have 
done. This shall surely be-unless you accept my Lord's terms.' 

'Name the terms,' said Gandalf steadily, but those nearby saw the 
anguish in his face, and now he seemed an old and wizened man, crushed, 
defeated at last. They did not doubt that he would accept. 

'These are the terms,' said the Messenger, and smiled as he eyed them 
one by one. 'The rabble of Gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw at 
once beyond the Anduin, first taking oaths never again to assail Sauron the 




Great in arms, open or secret. All lands east of Anduin shall be Sauron's 
for ever, solely. West of the Anduin as far as the Misty Mountains and the 
Gap of Rohan shall be tributary to Mordor, and men there shall bear no 
weapons, but shall have leave to govern their own affairs. But they shall 
help to rebuild Isengard which they have wantonly destroyed, and that shall 
be Sauron's, and there his lieutenant shall dwell: not Saruman, but one more 
worthy of trust.' 

Looking in the Messenger's eyes they read his thought. He was to be 
that lieutenant, and gather all that remained of the West under his sway; he 
would be their tyrant and they his slaves. 

But Gandalf said: 'This is much to demand for the delivery of one 
servant: that your Master should receive in exchange what he must else fight 
many a war to gain! Or has the field of Gondor destroyed his hope in war, so 
that he falls to haggling? And if indeed we rated this prisoner so high, 
what surety have we that Sauron the Base Master of Treachery, will keep his 
part? Where is this prisoner? Let him be brought forth and yielded to us, 
and then we will consider these demands.' 

It seemed then to Gandalf, intent, watching him as a man engaged in 
fencing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the Messenger was 
at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again. 

'Do not bandy words in your insolence with the Mouth of Sauron!' he 
cried. 'Surety you crave! Sauron gives none. If you sue for his clemency you 
must first do his bidding. These are his terms. Take them or leave them!' 

'These we will take!' said Gandalf suddenly. He cast aside his cloak 
and a white light shone forth like a sword in that black place. Before his 
upraised hand the foul Messenger recoiled, and Gandalf coming seized and 
took from him the tokens: coat, cloak, and sword. 'These we will take in 
memory of our friend,' he cried. 'But as for your terms, we reject them 
utterly. Get you gone, for your embassy is over and death is near to you. We 
did not come here to waste words in treating with Sauron, faithless and 
accursed; still less with one of his slaves. Begone!' 

Then the Messenger of Mordor laughed no more. His face was twisted with 
amazement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast that, as it crouches 
on its prey, is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod. Rage filled him 
and his mouth slavered, and shapeless sounds of fury came strangling from 
his throat. But he looked at the fell faces of the Captains and their deadly 
eyes, and fear overcame his wrath. He gave a great cry, and turned, leaped 




upon his steed, and with his company galloped madly back to Cirith Gorgor. 
But as they went his soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged; and 
even before they came to the gate Sauron sprang his trap. 

Drums rolled and fires leaped up. The great doors of the Black Gate 
swung back wide. Out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as swirling 
waters when a sluice is lifted. 

The Captains mounted again and rode back, and from the host of Mordor 
there went up a jeering yell. Dust rose smothering the air, as from nearby 
there marched up an army of Easterlings that had waited for the signal in 
the shadows of Ered Lithui beyond the further Tower. Down from the hills on 
either side of the Morannon poured Ores innumerable. The men of the West 
were trapped, and soon, all about the grey mounds where they stood, forces 
ten times and more than ten times their match would ring them in a sea of 
enemies. Sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel. 

Little time was left to Aragorn for the ordering of his battle. Upon 
the one hill he stood with Gandalf, and there fair and desperate was raised 
the banner of the Tree and Stars. Upon the other hill hard by stood the 
banners of Rohan and Dol Amroth, White Elorse and Silver Swan. And about 
each 

hill a ring was made facing all ways, bristling with spear and sword. But in 
the front towards Mordor where the first bitter assault would come there 
stood the sons of Elrond on the left with the D®nedain about them, and on 
the right the Prince Imrahil with the men of Dol Amroth tall and fair, and 
picked men of the Tower of Guard. 

The wind blew, and the trumpets sang, and arrows whined; but the sun 
now climbing towards the South was veiled in the reeks of Mordor, and 
through a threatening haze it gleamed, remote, a sullen red, as if it were 
the ending of the day, or the end maybe of all the world of light. And out 
of the gathering mirk the Nazgyl came with, their cold voices crying words 
of death; and then all hope was quenched. 

Pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard Gandalf reject the 
terms and doom Frodo to the torment of the Tower; but he had mastered 
himself, and now he stood beside Beregond in the front rank of Gondor with 
Imrahil's men. For it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter 
story of his life, since all was in ruin. 

’I wish Merry was here,’ he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts 
raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the 




assault. 'Well, well, now at any rate I understand poor Denethor a little 
better. We might die together, Merry and I, and since die we must, why not? 
Well, as he is not here, I hope he'll find an easier end. But now I must do 
my best.' 

He drew his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red 
and gold; and the flowing characters of N®menor glinted like fire upon the 
blade. 'This was made for just such an hour,' he thought. 'If only I could 
smite that foul Messenger with it, then almost I should draw level with old 
Merry. Well, I'll smite some of this beastly brood before the end. I wish I 
could see cool sunlight and green grass again!' 

Then even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into 
them. The ores hindered by the mires that lay before the hills halted and 
poured their arrows into the defending ranks. But through them there came 
striding up, roaring like beasts, a great company of hill-trolls out of 
Gorgoroth. Taller and broader than Men they were, and they were clad only in 
close-fitting mesh of horny scales, or maybe that was their hideous hide; 
but they bore round bucklers huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in 
their knotted hands. Reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across, 
bellowing as they came. Like a storm they broke upon the line of the men of 
Gondor, and beat upon helm and head, and arm and shield as smiths hewing the 
hot bending iron. At Pippin's side Beregond was stunned and overborne, and 
he fell; and the great troll-chief that smote him down bent over him, 
reaching out a clutching claw; for these fell creatures would bite the 
throats of those that they threw down. 

Then Pippin stabbed upwards, and the written blade of Westernesse 
pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his 
black blood came gushing out. He toppled forward and came crashing down 
like 

a falling rock, burying those beneath him. Blackness and stench and crushing 
pain came upon Pippin, and his mind fell away into a great darkness. 

'So it ends as I guessed it would,' his thought said, even as it 
fluttered away; and it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost gay 
it seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear. And then 
even as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed 
to be crying in some forgotten world far above: 

'The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!' 

For one moment more Pippin's thought hovered. 'Bilbo!' it said. 'But 




no! That came in his tale, long long ago. This is my tale, and it is ended 
now. Good-bye!' And his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more. 




Chapter 1 . The Tower of Cirith Ungol 



Sam roused himself painfully from the ground. For a moment he wondered 
where he was, and then all the misery and despair returned to him. He was in 
the deep dark outside the under -gate of the ores' stronghold; its brazen 
doors were shut. He must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against 
them; but how long he had lain there he did not know. Then he had been on 
fire, desperate and furious; now he was shivering and cold. He crept to the 
doors and pressed his ears against them. 

Far within he could hear faintly the voices of ores clamouring, but 
soon they stopped or passed out of hearing, and all was still. His head 
ached and his eyes saw phantom lights in the darkness, but he struggled to 
steady himself and think. It was clear at any rate that he had no hope of 
getting into the ore-hold by that gate; he might wait there for days before 
it was opened, and he could not wait: time was desperately precious. He no 
longer had any doubt about his duty: he must rescue his master or perish in 
the attempt. 

The perishing is more likely, and will be a lot easier anyway,’ he 
said grimly to himself, as he sheathed Sting and turned from the brazen 
doors. Slowly he groped his way back in the dark along the tunnel, not 
daring to use the elven-light; and as he went he tried to fit together the 
events since Frodo and he had left the Cross-roads. He wondered what the 
time was. Somewhere between one day and the next, he supposed; but even of 
the days he had quite lost count. He was in a land of darkness where the 
days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten 
too. 

T wonder if they think of us at all,' he said, 'and what is happening 
to them all away there.’ He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; 
but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to Shelob's 
tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the 
fourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning. And even now Aragorn was 
leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry was riding with the 




Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising 
and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all 
their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to 
Frodo and Sam. They were not forgotten. But they were far beyond aid, and no 
thought could yet bring any help to Samwise Hamfast's son; he was utterly 
alone. 

He came back at last to the stone door of the ore-passage, and still 
unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled over as 
before and dropped softly to the ground. Then he made his way stealthily to 
the outlet of Shelob's tunnel, where the rags of her great web were still 
blowing and swaying in the cold airs. For cold they seemed to Sam after the 
noisome darkness behind; but the breath of them revived him. He crept 
cautiously out. 

All was ominously quiet. The light was no more than that of dusk at a 
dark day’s end. The vast vapours that arose in Mordor and went streaming 
westward passed low overhead, a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit 
again beneath with a sullen glow of red. 

Sam looked up towards the ore-tower, and suddenly from its narrow 
windows lights stared out like small red eyes. He wondered if they were some 
signal. His fear of the ores, forgotten for a while in his wrath and 
desperation, now returned. As far as he could see, there was only one 
possible course for him to take: he must go on and try to find the main 
entrance to the dreadful tower; but his knees felt weak, and he found that 
he was trembling. Drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns of the 
Cleft before him, he forced his unwilling feet to obey him, and slowly, 
listening with all his ears, peering into the dense shadows of the rocks 
beside the way, he retraced his steps, past the place where Frodo fell, and 
still the stench of Shelob lingered, and then on and up, until he stood 
again in the very cleft where he had put on the Ring and seen Shagrat's 
company go by. 

There he halted and sat down. For the moment he could drive himself no 
further. He felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took 
one step veritably down into the land of Mordor, that step would be 
irrevocable. He could never come back. Without any clear purpose he drew out 
the Ring and put it on again. Immediately he felt the great burden of its 
weight, and felt afresh, but now more strong and urgent than ever, the 




malice of the Eye of Mordor, searching, trying to pierce the shadows that it 
had made for its own defence, but which now hindered it in its unquiet and 
doubt. 

As before, Sam found that his hearing was sharpened, but that to his 
sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky walls of the 
path were pale, as if seen through a mist, but still at a distance he heard 
the bubbling of Shelob in her misery: and harsh and clear, and very close it 
seemed, he heard cries and the clash of metal. He sprang to his feet, and 
pressed himself against the wall beside the road. He was glad of the Ring, 
for here was yet another company of ores on the march. Or so at first he 
thought. Then suddenly he realized that it was not so, his hearing had 
deceived him: the orc-cries came from the tower, whose topmost horn was 
now 

right above him, on the left hand of the Cleft. 

Sam shuddered and tried to force himself to move. There was plainly 
some devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the 
ores had mastered them, and they were tormenting Frodo, or even savagely 
hacking him to pieces. He listened; and as he did a gleam of hope came to 
him. There could not be much doubt: there was fighting in the tower, the 
ores must be at war among themselves, Shagrat and Gorbag had come to 
blows. 

Faint as was the hope that his guess brought him, it was enough to rouse 
him. There might be just a chance. His love for Frodo rose above all other 
thoughts, and forgetting his peril he cried aloud: 'I'm coming, Mr. Frodo!' 

He ran forward to the climbing path, and over it. At once the road 
turned left and plunged steeply down. Sam had crossed into Mordor. 

He took off the Ring, moved it may be by some deep premonition of 
danger, though to himself he thought only that he wished to see more 
clearly. 'Better have a look at the worst,' he muttered. 'No good blundering 
about in a fog!' 

Hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze. Before his 
feet the highest ridge of the Ephel D®ath fell steeply in great cliffs down 
into a dark trough, on the further side of which there rose another ridge, 
much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out 
black against the red light behind them: it was the grim Morgai, the inner 
ring of the fences of the land. Far beyond it, but almost straight ahead, 




across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires, there was a great 
burning glow; and from it rose in huge columns a swirling smoke, dusty red 
at the roots, black above where it merged into the billowing canopy that 
roofed in all the accursed land. 

Sam was looking at Orodruin, the Mountain of Fire. Ever and anon the 
furnaces far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surging 
and throbbing pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides. 
Some would flow blazing towards Barad-dyr down great channels; some 
would 

wind their way into the stony plain, until they cooled and lay like twisted 
dragon- shapes vomited from the tormented earth. In such an hour of labour 
Sam beheld Mount Doom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of 
the Ephel D®ath from those who climbed up the path from the West, now 
glared 

against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched with blood. 

In that dreadful light Sam stood aghast, for now, looking to his left, 
he could see the Tower of Cirith Ungol in all its strength. The horn that he 
had seen from the other side was only its topmost turret. Its eastern face 
stood up in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain- wall far below; 
its back was to a great cliff behind, from which it jutted out in pointed 
bastions, one above the other, diminishing as they rose, with sheer sides of 
cunning masonry that looked north-east and south-east. About the lowest 
tier, two hundred feet below where Sam now stood, there was a battlemented 
wall enclosing a narrow court. Its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, 
opened on a broad road, the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a 
precipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness 
to join the road that came over the Morgul Pass. Then on it went through a 
jagged rift in the Morgai out into the valley of Gorgoroth and away to 
Barad-dyr. The narrow upper way on which Sam stood leapt swiftly down 
by 

stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to 
the Tower-gate. 

As he gazed at it suddenly Sam understood, almost with a shock, that 
this stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of Mordor, but to 
keep them in. It was indeed one of the works of Gondor long ago, an eastern 
outpost of the defences of Ithilien, made when, after the Last Alliance, Men 
of Westernesse kept watch on the evil land of Sauron where his creatures 




still lurked. But as with Narchost and Carchost, the Towers of the Teeth, so 
here too the vigilance had failed, and treachery had yielded up the Tower to 
the Lord of the Ring wraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil 
things. Since his return to Mordor, Sauron had found it useful; for he had 
few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief purpose as of old 
was to prevent escape from Mordor. Though if an enemy were so rash as to try 
to enter that land secretly, then it was also a last unsleeping guard 
against any that might pass the vigilance of Morgul and of Shelob. 

Only too clearly Sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down 
under those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate. And even if he did 
so, he could not go far on the guarded road beyond: not even the black 
shadows, lying deep where the red glow could not reach, would shield him 
long from the night-eyed ores. But desperate as that road might be, his task 
was now far worse: not to avoid the gate and escape, but to enter it, alone. 

His thought turned to the Ring, but there was no comfort there, only 
dread and danger. No sooner had he come in sight of Mount Doom, burning 
far 

away, than he was aware of a change in his burden. As it drew near the great 
furnaces where, in the deeps of time, it had been shaped and forged, the 
Ring's power grew, and it became more fell, untameable save by some mighty 
will. As Sam stood there, even though the Ring was not on him but hanging by 
its chain about his neck, he felt himself enlarged, as if he were robed in a 
huge distorted shadow of himself, a vast and ominous threat halted upon the 
walls of Mordor. He felt that he had from now on only two choices: to 
forbear the Ring, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and challenge 
the Power that sat in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows. Already 
the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason. Wild fantasies arose 
in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a 
flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as 
he marched to the overthrow of Barad-dyr. And then all the clouds rolled 
away, and the white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth 
became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to 
put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be. 

In that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to 
hold him firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain 
hobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough 




to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray 
him. The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a 
garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to 
command. 

'And anyway all these notions are only a trick,' he said to himself. 

'He'd spot me and cow me, before I could so much as shout out. He'd spot me, 
pretty quick, if I put the Ring on now, in Mordor. Well, all I can say is: 
things look as hopeless as a frost in spring. Just when being invisible 
would be really useful, I can't use the Ring! And if ever I get any further, 
it's going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step. So what's to be 
done?' 

He was not really in any doubt. He knew that he must go down to the 
gate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders, as if to shake 
off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms, he began slowly to descend. With 
each step he seemed to diminish. He had not gone far before he had shrunk 
again to a very small and frightened hobbit. He was now passing under the 
very walls of the Tower, and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard 
with his unaided ears. At the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the 
court behind the outer wall. 

Sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into 
the red glow there came two ores running. They did not turn towards him. 
They were making for the main road; but even as they ran they stumbled and 
fell to the ground and lay still. Sam had seen no arrows, but he guessed 
that the ores had been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in 
the shadow of the gate. He went on, hugging the wall on his left. One look 
upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it. The stone-work 
rose thirty feet, without a crack or ledge, to overhanging courses like 
inverted steps. The gate was the only way. 

He crept on; and as he went he wondered how many ores lived in the 
Tower with Shagrat, and how many Gorbag had, and what they were 
quarrelling 

about, if that was what was happening. Shagrat's company had seemed to be 
about forty, and Gorbag's more than twice as large; but of course Shagrat's 
patrol had only been a part of his garrison. Almost certainly they were 
quarrelling about Frodo, and the spoil. For a second Sam halted, for 
suddenly things seemed clear to him, almost as if he had seen them with his 




eyes. The mithril coat! Of course, Frodo was wearing it, and they would find 
it. And from what Sam had heard Gorbag would covet it. But the orders of the 
Dark Tower were at present Frodo's only protection, and if they were set 
aside, Frodo might be killed out of hand at any moment. 

’Come on, you miserable sluggard!' Sam cried to himself. 'Now for it!' 

He drew Sting and ran towards the open gate. But just as he was about to 
pass under its great arch he felt a shock: as if he had run into some web 
like Shelob's, only invisible. He could see no obstacle, but something too 
strong for his will to overcome barred the way. He looked about, and then 
within the shadow of the gate he saw the Two Watchers. 

They were like great figures seated upon thrones. Each had three joined 
bodies, and three heads facing outward, and inward, and across the gateway. 
The heads had vulture-faces, and on their great knees were laid clawlike 
hands. They seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of stone, immovable, and 
yet they were aware: some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them. 
They knew an enemy. Visible or invisible none could pass unheeded. They 
would forbid his entry, or his escape. 

Hardening his will Sam thrust forward once again, and halted with a 
jerk, staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head. Then greatly 
daring, because he could think of nothing else to do, answering a sudden 
thought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of Galadriel and held 
it up. Its white light quickened swiftly, and the shadows under the dark 
arch fled. The monstrous Watchers sat there cold and still, revealed in all 
their hideous shape. For a moment Sam caught a glitter in the black stones 
of their eyes, the very malice of which made him quail; but slowly he felt 
their will waver and crumble into fear. 

He sprang past them; but even as he did so, thrusting the phial back 
into his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to 
behind him, that their vigilance was renewed. And from those evil heads 
there came a high shrill cry that echoed in the towering walls before him. 

Far up above, like an answering signal, a harsh bell clanged a single 
stroke. 

'That's done it!' said Sam. 'Now I've rung the front-door bell! Well, 
come on somebody!' he cried. 'Tell Captain Shagrat that the great 
Elf-warrior has called, with his elf-sword too!’ 

There was no answer. Sam strode forward. Sting glittered blue in his 




hand. The courtyard lay in deep shadow, but he could see that the pavement 
was strewn with bodies. Right at his feet were two ore-archers with knives 
sticking in their backs. Beyond lay many more shapes; some singly as they 
had been hewn down or shot; others in pairs, still grappling one another, 
dead in the very throes of stabbing, throttling, biting. The stones were 
slippery with dark blood. 

Two liveries Sam noticed, one marked by the Red Eye, the other by a 
Moon disfigured with a ghastly face of death; but he did not stop to look 
more closely. Across the court a great door at the foot of the Tower stood 
half open, and a red light came through; a large ore lay dead upon the 
threshold. Sam sprang over the body and went in; and then he peered about at 
a loss. 

A wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the 
mountain-side. It was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on the 
walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors and openings could 
be seen on this side and that; but it was empty save for two or three more 
bodies sprawling on the floor. From what he had heard of the captains' talk 
Sam knew that, dead or alive, Frodo would most likely be found in a chamber 
high up in the turret far above; but he might search for a day before he 
found the way. 

'It'll be near the back, I guess,' Sam muttered. 'The whole Tower 
climbs backwards-like. And anyway I'd better follow these lights.' 

He advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant. 
Terror was beginning to grip him again. There was no sound save the rap of 
his feet, which seemed to grow to an echoing noise, like the slapping of 
great hands upon the stones. The dead bodies: the emptiness; the dank black 
walls that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the fear of sudden 
death lurking in doorway or shadow; and behind all his mind the waiting 
watchful malice at the gate: it was almost more than he could screw himself 
to face. He would have welcomed a fight-with not too many enemies at a time 
- rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to think 
of Frodo, lying bound or in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place. 

He went on. 

He had passed beyond the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at 
the end of the passage, the inner side of the under gate, as he rightly 
guessed, when there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek. He 
stopped short. Then he heard feet coming. Someone was running in great haste 




down an echoing stairway overhead. 

His will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the 
chain and clutched the Ring. But Sam did not put it on; for even as he 
clasped it to his breast, an ore came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark 
opening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more than six paces from 
him when, lifting its head, it saw him; and Sam could hear its gasping 
breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For 
what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword: 
it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the 
wavering light behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very light of which 
was a bitter pain, the other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed 
some nameless menace of power and doom. 

For a moment the ore crouched, and then with a hideous yelp of fear it 
turned and fled back as it had come. Never was any dog more heartened when 
its enemy turned tail than Sam at this unexpected flight. With a shout he 
gave chase. 

'Yes! The Elf- warrior is loose!' he cried. 'I'm coming. Just you show 
me the way up, or I'll skin you!' 

But the ore was in its own haunts, nimble and well-fed. Sam was a 
stranger, hungry and weary. The stairs were high and steep and winding. 
Sam's breath began to come in gasps. The ore had soon passed out of sight, 
and now only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet as it went on 
and up. Every now and again it gave a yell, and the echo ran along the 
walls. But slowly all sound of it died away. 

Sam plodded on. He felt that he was on the right road, and his spirits 
had risen a good deal. He thrust the Ring away and tightened his belt. 

'Well, well!’ he said. 'If only they all take such a dislike to me and my 
Sting, this may turn out better than I hoped. And anyway it looks as if 
Shagrat, Gorbag, and company have done nearly all my job for me. Except for 
that little frightened rat, I do believe there's nobody left alive in the 
place!' 

And with that he stopped, brought up hard, as if he had hit his head 
against the stone wall. The full meaning of what he had said struck him like 
a blow. Nobody left alive! Whose had been that horrible dying shriek? 
'Frodo, Frodo! Master!’ he cried half sobbing. ’If they've killed you, what 
shall I do? Well, I'm coming at last, right to the top, to see what I must.' 




Up, up he went. It was dark save for an occasional torch flaring at a 
turn, or beside some opening that led into the higher levels of the Tower. 
Sam tried to count the steps, but after two hundred he lost his reckoning. 

He was moving quietly now: for he thought that he could hear the sound of 
voices talking, still some way above. More than one rat remained alive, it 
seemed. 

All at once, when he felt that he could pump out no more breath, nor 
force his knees to bend again, the stair ended. He stood still. The voices 
were now loud and near. Sam peered about. He had climbed right to the flat 
roof of the third and highest tier of the Tower: an open space, about twenty 
yards across, with a low parapet. There the stair was covered by a small 
domed chamber in the midst of the roof, with low doors facing east and west. 
Eastward Sam could see the plain of Mordor vast and dark below, and the 
burning mountain far away. A fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells, 
and the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of many 
miles the light of them lit the tower -top with a red glare. Westward the 
view was blocked by the base of the great turret that stood at the back of 
this upper court and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling 
hills. Light gleamed in a window-slit. Its door was not ten yards from where 
Sam stood. It was open but dark, and from just within its shadow the voices 
came. 

At first Sam did not listen; he took a pace out of the eastward door 
and looked about. At once he saw that up here the fighting had been 
fiercest. All the court was choked with dead ores or their severed and 
scattered heads and limbs. The place stank of death. A snarl followed by a 
blow and a cry sent him darting back into hiding. An ore-voice rose in 
anger, and he knew it again at once, harsh, brutal, cold. It was Shagrat 
speaking, Captain of the Tower. 

'You won’t go again, you say? Curse you, Snaga, you little maggot! If 
you think I'm so damaged that it’s safe to flout me, you're mistaken Come 
here, and I'll squeeze your eyes out, like I did to Radbug just now. And 
when some new lads come, I'll deal with you: I'll send you to Shelob.' 

'They won’t come, not before you're dead anyway,' answered Snaga 
surlily. 'I've told you twice that Gorbag's swine got to the gate first, and 
none of ours got out. Lagduf and Muzgash ran through, but they were shot. I 
saw it from a window, I tell you. And they were the last.' 

'Then you must go. I must stay here anyway. But I'm hurt. The Black 




Pits take that filthy rebel Gorbag!' Shagrat's voice trailed off into a 
string of foul names and curses. 'I gave him better than I got, but he 
knifed me, the dung, before I throttled him. You must go, or I'll eat you. 

News must get through to Lugb®rz, or we'll both be for the Black Pits. Yes, 
you too. You won’t escape by skulking here.' 

Tm not going down those stairs again,' growled Snaga, 'be you captain 
or no. Nar! Keep your hands off your knife, or I'll put an arrow in your 
guts. You won't be a captain long when They hear about all these goings-on. 
I've fought for the Tower against those stinking Morgul-rats, but a nice 
mess you two precious captains have made of things, fighting over the swag.' 

'That's enough from you,' snarled Shagrat. V I had my orders. It was 
Gorbag started it, trying to pinch that pretty shirt.' 

'Well, you put his back up, being so high and mighty. And he had more 
sense than you anyway. He told you more than once that the most dangerous of 
these spies was still loose, and you wouldn't listen. And you won't listen 
now. Gorbag was right, I tell you. There's a great fighter about, one of 
those bloody -handed Elves, or one of the filthy tarksA He's coming here, I 
tell you. You heard the bell. He's got past the Watchers, and that's tark's 
work. He's on the stairs. And until he's off them, I'm not going down. Not 
if you were a Nazgyl, I wouldn't.' 

'So that's it, is it?' yelled Shagrat. 'You'll do this, and you'll not 
do that? And when he does come, you'll bolt and leave me? No, you won't! 
I'll put red maggot-holes in your belly first.' 

Out of the turret-door the smaller ore came flying. Behind him came 
Shagrat, a large ore with long arms that, as he ran crouching, reached to 
the ground. But one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding; the other 
hugged a large black bundle. In the red glare Sam, cowering behind the 
stair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed: it was scored as 
if by rending claws and smeared with blood; slaver dripped from its 
protruding fangs; the mouth snarled like an animal. 

As far as Sam could see, Shagrat hunted Snaga round the roof, until 
ducking and eluding him the smaller ore with a yelp darted back into the 
turret and disappeared. Then Shagrat halted. Out of the eastward door Sam 
could see him now by the parapet, panting, his left claw clenching and 
unclenching feebly. He put the bundle on the floor and with his right claw 
drew out a long red knife and spat on it. Going to the parapet he leaned 
over, looking down into the outer court far below. Twice he shouted but no 




answer came. 

Suddenly, as Shagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back to the 
roof-top, Sam to his amazement saw that one of the sprawling bodies was 
moving. It was crawling. It put out a claw and clutched the bundle. It 
staggered up. In its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a short 
broken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust. But at that very moment a 
hiss escaped its teeth, a gasp of pain or hate. Quick as a snake Shagrat 
slipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy's throat. 

'Got you, Gorbag!’ he cried. ’Not quite dead, eh? Well, I'll finish my 
job now.’ He sprang on to the fallen body, and stamped and trampled it in 
his fury, stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife. 

Satisfied at last, he threw back his head and let out a horrible gurgling 
yell of triumph. Then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and 
catching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs. 

Sam had no time to think. He might have slipped out of the other door, 
but hardly without being seen; and he could not have played hide-and-seek 
with this hideous ore for long. He did what was probably the best thing he 
could have done. He sprang out to meet Shagrat with a shout. He was no 
longer holding the Ring, but it was there, a hidden power, a cowing menace 
to the slaves of Mordor; and in his hand was Sting, and its light smote the 
eyes of the ore like the glitter of cruel stars in the terrible 
elf-countries, the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind. And 
Shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure. He stopped, 
growling, baring his fangs. Then once more, ore-fashion, he leapt aside, and 
as Sam sprang at him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he 
thrust it hard into his enemy's face. Sam staggered, and before he could 
recover, Shagrat darted past and down the stairs. 

Sam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far. Soon the thought of 
Frodo returned to him, and he remembered that the other ore had gone back 
into the turret. Here was another dreadful choice, and he had no time to 
ponder it. If Shagrat got away, he would soon get help and come back. But if 
Sam pursued him, the other ore might do some horrible deed up there. And 
anyway Sam might miss Shagrat or be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran 
back up the stairs. 'Wrong again, I expect,' he sighed. 'But it’s my job to 
go right up to the top first, whatever happens afterwards.' 

Away below Shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the court 
and through the gate, bearing his precious burden. If Sam could have seen 




him and known the grief that his escape would bring, he might have quailed. 
But now his mind was set on the last stage of his search. He came cautiously 
to the turret-door and stepped inside. It opened into darkness. But soon his 
staring eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand. It came from an 
opening that led to another stairway, dark and narrow: it appeared to go 
winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. A torch was 
glimmering from somewhere up above. 

Softly Sam began to climb. He came to the guttering torch, fixed above 
a door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the 
red eyes that he and Frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel's mouth. 
Quickly Sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey, dreading at 
any moment to he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat 
from behind. He came next to a window looking east and another torch above 
the door to a passage through the middle of the turret. The door was open, 
the passage dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from 
outside filtering through the window-slit. But here the stair stopped and 
climbed no further. Sam crept into the passage. On either side there was a 
low door; both were closed and locked. There was no sound at all. 

'A dead end,’ muttered Sam; 'and after all my climb! This can't be the 
top of the tower. But what can I do now?' 

He ran back to the lower storey and tried the door. It would not move. 

He ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face. He felt that even 
minutes were precious, but one by one they escaped; and he could do nothing. 
He cared no longer for Shagrat or Snaga or any other ore that was ever 
spawned. He longed only for his master, for one sight of his face or one 
touch of his hand. 

At last, weary and feeling finally defeated, he sat on a step below the 
level of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands. It was quiet, 
horribly quiet. The torch, that was already burning low when he arrived, 
sputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide. And 
then softly, to his own surprise, there at the vain end of his long journey 
and his grief, moved by what thought in his heart he could not tell, Sam 
began to sing. 

His voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice 
of a forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening ore could possibly mistake 
for the clear song of an Elven-lord. He murmured old childish tunes out of 
the Shire, and snatches of Mr. Bilbo's rhymes that came into his mind like 




fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. And then suddenly new strength 
rose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to 
fit the simple tune. 

In western lands beneath the Sun 
the flowers may rise in Spring, 
the trees may bud, the waters run, 
the merry finches sing. 

Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night 
and swaying beeches bear 
the Elven-stars as jewels white 
amid their branching hair. 

Though here at journey's end I lie 
in darkness buried deep, 
beyond all towers strong and high, 
beyond all mountains steep, 
above all shadows rides the Sun 
and Stars for ever dwell: 

I will not say the Day is done, 
nor bid the Stars farewell. 

'Beyond all towers strong and high,' he began again, and then he 
stopped short. He thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him. But 
now he could hear nothing. Yes, he could hear something, but not a voice. 
Footsteps were approaching. Now a door was being opened quietly in the 
passage above; the hinges creaked. Sam crouched down listening. The door 
closed with a dull thud; and then a snarling ore-voice rang out. 

'Ho la! You up there, you dunghill rat! Stop your squeaking, or I'll 
come and deal with you. D'you hear?' 

There was no answer. 

’All right,' growled Snaga. 'But I'll come and have a look at you all 
the same, and see what you're up to.' 

The hinges creaked again, and Sam, now peering over the corner of the 
passage-threshold, saw a flicker of light in an open doorway, and the dim 
shape of an ore coming out. He seemed to be carrying a ladder. Suddenly the 
answer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber was reached by a trap-door in 
the 

roof of the passage. Snaga thrust the ladder upwards, steadied it, and then 




clambered out of sight. Sam heard a bolt drawn back. Then he heard the 
hideous voice speaking again. 

'You lie quiet, or you'll pay for it! You've not got long to live in 
peace, I guess; but if you don't want the fun to begin right now, keep your 
trap shut, see? There's a reminder for you!' There was a sound like the 
crack of a whip. 

At that rage blazed in Sam's heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up, ran, 
and went up the ladder like a cat. His head came out in the middle of the 
floor of a large round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof; the westward 
window-slit was high and dark. Something was lying on the floor by the wall 
under the window, but over it a black ore-shape was straddled. It raised a 
whip a second time, but the blow never fell. 

With a cry Sam leapt across the floor, Sting in hand. The ore wheeled 
round, but before it could make a move Sam slashed its whip-hand from its 
arm. Howling with pain and fear but desperate the ore charged head-down at 
him. Sam's next blow went wide, and thrown off his balance he fell 
backwards, clutching at the ore as it stumbled over him. Before he could 
scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The ore in its wild haste had tripped 
on the ladder -head and fallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more 
thought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo. 

He was naked, lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his arm 
was flung up, shielding his head, and across his side there ran an ugly 
whip-weal. 

'Frodo! Mr. Frodo, my dear!’ cried Sam, tears almost blinding him. 

'It's Sam, I've come!' He half lifted his master and hugged him to his 
breast. Frodo opened his eyes. 

'Am I still dreaming?’ he muttered. 'But the other dreams were 
horrible.’ 

'You're not dreaming at all, Master,' said Sam. 'It's real. It's me. 

I've come.' 

'I can hardly believe it,’ said Frodo, clutching him. 'There was an ore 
with a whip, and then it turns into Sam! Then I wasn't dreaming after all 
when I heard that singing down below, and I tried to answer? Was it you?' 

'It was indeed, Mr. Frodo. I'd given up hope, almost. I couldn't find 
you. 

Well, you have now, Sam, dear Sam, said Frodo, and he la back in Sam's 




gentle arms, closing his eyes, like a child at rest when night-fears are 
driven away by some loved voice or hand. 

Sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness; but it was 
not allowed. It was not enough for him to find his master, he had still to 
try and save him. He kissed Frodo's forehead. 'Come! Wake up Mr. Frodo!' he 
said, trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back the curtains 
at Bag End on a summer's morning. 

Frodo sighed and sat up. 'Where are we? How did I get here?’ he asked. 

'There's no time for tales till we get somewhere else, Mr. Frodo,' said 
Sam. 'But you're in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by 
the tunnel before the ores got you. How long ago that was I don't know. More 
than a day, I guess.' 

'Only that?' said Frodo. 'It seems weeks. You must tell me all about 
it, if we get a chance. Something hit me, didn't it? And I fell into 
darkness and foul dreams, and woke and found that waking was worse. Ores 
were all round me. I think they had just been pouring some horrible burning 
drink down my throat. My head grew clear, but I was aching and weary. They 
stripped me of everything; and then two great brutes came and questioned me, 
questioned me until I thought I should go mad, standing over me, gloating, 
fingering their knives. I'll never forget their claws and eyes.' 

'You won't, if you talk about them, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'And if we 
don't want to see them again, the sooner we get going the better. Can you 
walk?' 

'Yes, I can walk,' said Frodo, getting up slowly. 'I am not hurt Sam. 

Only I feel very tired, and I've a pain here.' He put his hand to the back 
of his neck above his left shoulder. He stood up, and it looked to Sam as if 
he was clothed in flame: his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp 
above. Twice he paced across the floor. 

'That's better!' he said, his spirits rising a little. 'I didn't dare 
to move when I was left alone, or one of the guards came. Until the yelling 
and fighting began. The two big brutes: they quarrelled, I think. Over me 
and my things. I lay here terrified. And then all went deadly quiet, and 
that was worse.' 

'Yes, they quarrelled, seemingly,' said Sam. (There must have been a 
couple of hundred of the dirty creatures in this place. A bit of a tall 
order for Sam Gamgee, as you might say. But they've done all the killing of 
themselves. That's lucky, but it's too long to make a song about, till we're 




out of here. Now what's to be done? You can't go walking in the Black Land 
in naught but your skin, Mr. Frodo.' 

'They've taken everything, Sam,' said Frodo. 'Everything I had. Do you 
understand? Everything!' Fie cowered on the floor again with bowed head, as 
his own words brought home to him the fullness of the disaster, and despair 
overwhelmed him. 'The quest has failed Sam. Even if we get out of here, we 
can't escape. Only Elves can escape. Away, away out of Middle-earth, far 
away over the Sea. If even that is wide enough to keep the Shadow out.' 

'No, not everything, Mr. Frodo. And it hasn't failed, not yet. I took 
it, Mr. Frodo, begging your pardon. And I've kept it safe. It's round my 
neck now, and a terrible burden it is, too.' Sam fumbled for the Ring and 
its chain. 'But I suppose you must take it back.’ Now it had come to it, Sam 
felt reluctant to give up the Ring and burden his master with it again. 

'You've got it?' gasped Frodo. 'You've got it here? Sam, you're a 
marvel!' Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. 'Give it to me!’ he 
cried, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. 'Give it me at once! You 
can't have it!' 

'All right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rather startled. 'Here it is!' Slowly 
he drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head. 'But you're in the 
land of Mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you'll see the Fiery Mountain 
and all. You'll find the Ring very dangerous now, and very hard to bear. If 
it's too hard a job, I could share it with you, maybe?' 

'No, no!' cried Frodo, snatching the Ring and chain from Sam's hands. 

'No you won't, you thief!' He panted, staring at Sam with eyes wide with 
fear and enmity. Then suddenly, clasping the Ring in one clenched fist, he 
stood aghast. A mist seemed to clear from his eyes, and he passed a hand 
over his aching brow. The hideous vision had seemed so real to him, half 
bemused as he was still with wound and fear. Sam had changed before his very 
eyes into an ore again, leering and pawing at his treasure, a foul little 
creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth. But now the vision had 
passed. There was Sam kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain, as if 
he had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes. 

'O Sam!' cried Frodo. 'What have I said? What have I done? Forgive me! 
After all you have done. It is the horrible power of the Ring. I wish it had 
never, never, been found. But don't mind me, Sam. I must carry the burden to 
the end. It can't be altered. You can't come between me and this doom.' 

'That's all right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rubbing his sleeve across his 




eyes. 'I understand. But I can still help, can't I? I've got to get you out 
of here. At once, see! But first you want some clothes and gear and then 
some food. The clothes will be the easiest part. As we're in Mordor, we’d, 
best dress up Mordor -fashion; and anyway there isn't no choice. It'll have 
to be ore-stuff for you, Mr. Frodo, I'm afraid. And for me too. If we go 
together, we'd best match. Now put this round you!' 

Sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about Frodo's shoulders. Then 
unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor. He drew Sting from its sheath. 
Hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade. 'I was forgetting this, Mr. 
Frodo,' he said. 'No, they didn't get everything! You lent me Sting, if you 
remember, and the Lady's glass. I've got them both still. But lend them to 
me a little longer, Mr. Frodo. I must go and see what I can find. You stay 
here. Walk about a bit and ease your legs. I shan't be long. I shan't have 
to go far.' 

'Take care, Sam!' said Frodo. 'And be quick! There may be ores still 
alive, lurking in wait.' 

'I've got to chance it,' said Sam. He stepped to the trap-door and 
slipped down the ladder. In a minute his head reappeared. He threw a long 
knife on the floor. 

'There's something that might be useful,' he said. 'He's dead: the one 
that whipped you. Broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. Now you draw up 
the ladder, if you can, Mr. Frodo; and don't you let it down till you hear 
me call the password. Elbereth I'll call. What the Elves say. No ore would 
say that.' 

Frodo sat for a while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing one another 
through his mind. Then he got up, drew the grey elven-cloak about him, and 
to keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro, prying and peering into 
every corner of his prison. 

It was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least, before 
he heard Sam's voice calling softly from below: Elbereth, Elbereth. Frodo 
let down the light ladder. Up came Sam, puffing, heaving a great bundle on 
his head. He let it fall with a thud. 

'Quick now. Mr. Frodo!’ he said. 'I’ve had a bit of a search to find 
anything small enough for the likes of us. We'll have to make do. But we 
must hurry. I've met nothing alive, and I've seen nothing but I'm not easy. 

I think this place is being watched. I can't explain it, but well: it feels 




to me as if one of those foul flying Riders was about, up in the blackness 
where he can't be seen.' 

He opened the bundle. Frodo looked in disgust at the contents, but 
there was nothing for it: he had to put the things on, or go naked. There 
were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty 
leather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail, 
short for a full-sized ore, too long for Frodo and heavy. About it he 
clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed 
stabbing-sword. Sam had brought several ore-helmets. One of them fitted 
Frodo well enough, a black cap with iron rim, and iron hoops covered with 
leather upon which the evil Eye was painted in red above the beaklike 
nose-guard. 

'The Morgul-stuff, Gorbag's gear, was a better fit and better made,' 
said Sam; 'but it wouldn't do, I guess, to go carrying his tokens into 
Mordor, not after this business here. Well, there you are, Mr. Frodo. A 
perfect little ore, if I may make so bold-at least you would be, if we could 
cover your face with a mask, give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged. 
This will hide some of the tell-tales.' He put a large black cloak round 
Frodo's shoulders. 'Now you're ready! You can pick up a shield as we go.' 

'What about you, Sam?' said Frodo. 'Aren't we going to match?' 

'Well, Mr. Frodo, I've been thinking,' said Sam. 'I'd best not leave 
any of my stuff behind, and we can't destroy it. And I can't wear ore-mail 
over all my clothes, can I? I'll just have to cover up.' 

He knelt down and carefully folded his elven-cloak. It went into a 
surprisingly small roll. This he put into his pack that lay on the floor. 

Standing up, he slung it behind his back, put an ore-helm on his head, and 
cast another black cloak about his shoulders. 'There!' he said. 'Now we 
match, near enough. And now we must be off!' 

'I can't go all the way at a run, Sam,' said Frodo with a wry smile. 'I 
hope you've made inquiries about inns along the road? Or have you forgotten 
about food and drink?' 

'Save me, but so I had!’ said Sam. He whistled in dismay. 'Bless me, 

Mr. Frodo, but you've gone and made me that hungry and thirsty! I don't know 
when drop or morsel last passed my lips. I'd forgotten it, trying to find 
you. But let me think! Last time I looked I'd got about enough of that 
waybread, and of what Captain Faramir gave us, to keep me on my legs for a 
couple of weeks at a pinch. But if there's a drop left in my bottle, there's 




no more. That's not going to be enough for two, nohow. Don’t ores eat, and 
don't they drink? Or do they just live on foul air and poison?’ 

'No, they eat and drink, Sam. The Shadow that bred them can only mock, 
it cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don’t think it gave life 
to the ores, it only ruined them and twisted them; and if they are to live 
at all, they have to live like other living creatures. Foul waters and foul 
meats they’ll take, if they can get no better, but not poison. They’ve fed 
me, and so I’m better off than you. There must be food and water somewhere 
in this place.’ 'But there's no time to look for them,’ said Sam. 

'Well, things are a bit better than you think,’ said Frodo. ’I have had 
a bit of luck while you were away. Indeed they did not take everything. I’ve 
found my food-bag among some rags on the floor. They've rummaged it, of 
course. But I guess they disliked the very look and smell of the lembas, 
worse than Gollum did. It's scattered about and some of it is trampled and 
broken, but I've gathered it together. It's not far short of what you've 
got. But they’ve taken Faramir’s food, and they’ve slashed up my 
water-bottle.' 

'Well, there’s no more to be said,’ said Sam. 'We’ve got enough to 
start on. But the water’s going to be a bad business. But come Mr. Frodo! 

Off we go, or a whole lake of it won’t do us any good!’ 

’Not till you've had a mouthful, Sam,' said Frodo. 'I won’t budge. 

Here, take this elven-cake, and drink that last drop in your bottle! The 
whole thing is quite hopeless, so it’s no good worrying about tomorrow. It 
probably won’t come.’ 

At last they started. Down the ladder they climbed, and then Sam took 
it and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen ore. The 
stair was dark, but on the roof-top the glare of the Mountain could still be 
seen, though it was dying down now to a sullen red. They picked up two 
shields to complete their disguise and then went on. 

Down the great stairway they plodded. The high chamber of the turret 
behind, where they had met again, seemed almost homely: they were out in the 
open again now, and terror ran along the walls. All might be dead in the 
Tower of Cirith Ungol, but it was steeped in fear and evil still. 

At length they came to the door upon the outer court, and they halted. 

Even from where they stood they felt the malice of the Watchers beating on 
them, black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare 




of Mordor dimly showed. As they threaded their way among the hideous 
bodies 

of the ores each step became more difficult. Before they even reached the 
archway they were brought to a stand. To move an inch further was a pain and 
weariness to will and limb. 

Frodo had no strength for such a battle. He sank to the ground. 'I 
can't go on, Sam,' he murmured. v I'm going to faint. I don’t know what's 
come over me.' 

V I do, Mr. Frodo. Hold up now! It's the gate. There's some devilry 
there. But I got through, and I'm going to get out. It can't be more 
dangerous than before. Now for it!' 

Sam drew out the elven-glass of Galadriel again. As if to do honour to 
his hardihood, and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand 
that had done such deeds, the phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the 
shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like lightning; but it 
remained steady and did not pass. 

'Gilthoniel, A Elbereth!' Sam cried. For, why he did not know, his 
thought sprang back suddenly to the Elves in the Shire, and the song that 
drove away the Black Rider in the trees. 

Aiya elenion ancalima!' cried Frodo once again behind him. 

The will of the Watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping 
of a cord, and Frodo and Sam stumbled forward. Then they ran. Through the 
gate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes. There was 
a crack. The keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels, and the 
wall above crumbled, and fell in ruin. Only by a hair did they escape. A 
bell clanged; and from the Watchers there went up a high and dreadful wail. 
Far up above in the darkness it was answered. Out of the black sky there 
came dropping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with a ghastly 
shriek. 




Chapter 2 . The Land of Shadow 



Sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast. 

'Run, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'No, not that way! There's a sheer drop over the 
wall. Follow me!' 

Down the road from the gate they fled. In fifty paces, with a swift 
bend round a jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of sight from 
the Tower. They had escaped for the moment. Cowering back against the rock 
they drew breath, and then they clutched at their hearts. Perching now on 
the wall beside the ruined gate the Nazgyl sent out its deadly cries. All 
the cliffs echoed. 

In terror they stumbled on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward again 
and exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the Tower. As they 
flitted across they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the 
battlement; then they plunged down between high rock-walls in a cutting that 
fell steeply to join the Morgul-road. They came to the way-meeting. There 
was still no sign of ores, nor of an answer to the cry of the Nazgyl; but 
they knew that the silence would not last long. At any moment now the hunt 
would begin. 

'This won't do, Sam,' said Frodo. 'If we were real ores, we ought to be 
dashing back to the Tower, not running away. The first enemy we meet will 
know us. We must get off this road somehow.' 

'But we can't,' said Sam, 'not without wings.' 

The eastern faces of the Ephel D®ath were sheer, falling in cliff and 
precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge. A 
short way beyond the way-meeting, after another steep incline, a flying 
bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the 
tumbled slopes and glens of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt Frodo and Sam 
dashed along the bridge; but they had hardly reached its further end when 
they heard the hue and cry begin. Away behind them, now high above on the 
mountain- side, loomed the Tower of Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully. 
Suddenly its harsh bell clanged again, and then broke into a shattering 
peal. Horns sounded. And now from beyond the bridge-end came 
answering 

cries. Down in the dark trough, cut off from the dying glare of Orodruin, 




Frodo and Sam could not see ahead, but already they heard the tramp of 
iron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs. 

'Quick, Sam! Over we go!' cried Frodo. They scrambled onto the low 
parapet of the bridge. Fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop 
into the gulf, for the slopes of the Morgai had already risen almost to the 
level of the road; but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the 
fall. 

'Well, here goes, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'Good-bye!' 

Fie let go. Frodo followed. And even as they fell they heard the rush of 
horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet running up 
behind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared. Half fearing a breaking 
plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than 
a dozen feet, with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had 
expected: a tangle of thorny bushes. There Sam lay still, softly sucking a 
scratched hand. 

When the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper. 
'Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but I didn't know as anything grew in Mordor! But if I 
had a'known, this is just what I'd have looked for. These thorns must be a 
foot long by the feel of them; they've stuck through everything I've got on. 
Wish I'd a'put that mail-shirt on!' 

'Ore-mail doesn't keep these thorns out,' said Frodo. 'Not even a 
leather jerkin is any good.' 

They had a struggle to get out of the thicket. The thorns and briars 
were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws. Their cloaks were rent and 
tattered before they broke free at last. 

'Now down we go, Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'Down into the valley quick, 
and then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.' 

Day was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of 
Mordor the Sun was climbing over the eastern rim of Middle-earth; but here 
all was still dark as night. The Mountain smouldered and its fires went out. 
The glare faded from the cliffs. The easterly wind that had been blowing 
ever since they left Ithilien now seemed dead. Slowly and painfully they 
clambered down, groping, stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and 
dead 

wood in the blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further. 

At length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against a 
boulder. Both were sweating. 'If Shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of 




water, I'd shake his hand,' said Sam. 

'Don't say such things!' said Frodo. 'It only makes it worse.' Then he 
stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while. At 
last with a struggle he got up again. To his amazement he found that Sam was 
asleep. 'Wake up, Sam!' he said. 'Come on! It's time we made another 
effort.' 

Sam scrambled to his feet. 'Weill never!' he said. 'I must have 
dropped off. It's a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep, and my 
eyes just closed down on their own.' 

Frodo now led the way, northward as near as he could guess, among the 
stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine. But 
presently he stopped again. 

'It's no good, Sam,' he said. 'I can't manage it. This mail-shirt, I 
mean. Not in my present state. Even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when I was 
tired. This is far heavier. And what's the use of it? We shan't win through 
by fighting.' 

'But we may have some to do,' said Sam. 'And there's knives and stray 
arrows. That Gollum isn't dead, for one thing. I don't like to think of you 
with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark.' 

'Look here, Sam dear lad,' said Frodo: 'I am tired, weary, I haven't a 
hope left. But I have to go on trying to get to the Mountain, as long as I 
can move. The Ring is enough. This extra weight is killing me. It must go. 

But don't think I'm ungrateful. I hate to think of the foul work you must 
have had among the bodies to find it for me.' 

'Don't talk about it, Mr. Frodo. Bless you! I'd carry you on my back, 
if I could. Let it go then!' 

Frodo laid aside his cloak and took off the ore-mail and flung it away. 

He shivered a little. 'What I really need is something warm,' he said. 'It's 
gone cold, or else I've caught a chill.' 

'You can have my cloak, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. He unslung his pack and 
took out the elven-cloak. 'How's this, Mr. Frodo?' he said. 'You wrap that 
ore-rag close round you, and put the belt outside it. Then this can go over 
all. It don't look quite ore-fashion, but it'll keep you warmer; and I 
daresay it'll keep you from harm better than any other gear. It was made by 
the Lady.' 

Frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch. 'That's better!' he said. 

'I feel much lighter. I can go on now. But this blind dark seems to be 




getting into my heart. As I lay in prison, Sam. I tried to remember the 
Brandywine, and Woody End, and The Water running through the mill at 
Hobbiton. But I can’t see them now.' 

There now, Mr. Frodo, it's you that's talking of water this time!' 
said Sam. 'If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I'd say to her: (Your 
Ladyship, all we want is light and water: just clean water and plain 
daylight, better than any jewels, begging your pardon.( But it's a long way 
to Lurien.' Sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights of the Ephel 
D®ath, now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky. 

They started off again. They had not gone far when Frodo paused. 
'There's a Black Rider over us,' he said. 'I can feel it. We had better keep 
still for a while.' 

Crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back westward and did 
not speak for some time. Then Frodo breathed a sigh of relief. 'It's 
passed,' he said. They stood up, and then they both stared in wonder. Away 
to their left, southward, against a sky that was turning grey, the peaks and 
high ridges of the great range began to appear dark and black, visible 
shapes. Light was growing behind them. Slowly it crept towards the North. 
There was battle far above in the high spaces of the air. The billowing 
clouds of Mordor were being driven back, their edges tattering as a wind out 
of the living world came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark 
land of their home. Under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light 
leaked into Mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison. 

'Look at it, Mr. Frodo!' said Sam. 'Look at it! The wind's changed. 
Something's happening. He's not having it all his own way. His darkness is 
breaking up out in the world there. I wish I could see what is going on!' 

It was the morning of the fifteenth of March, and over the Vale of 
Anduin the Sun was rising above the eastern shadow, and the south-west wind 
was blowing. Thjoden lay dying on the Pelennor Fields. 

As Frodo and Sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all along the 
line of the Ephel D®ath, and then they saw a shape, moving at a great speed 
out of the West, at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip 
above the mountain-tops, but growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the 
dark canopy and passed high above them. As it went it sent out a long shrill 
cry, the voice of a Nazgyl; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: 
it was a cry of woe and dismay, ill tidings for the Dark Tower. The Lord of 




the Ring-wraiths had met his doom. 

’What did I tell you? Something's happening!' cried Sam.' (The war's 
going well,( said Shagrat; but Gorbag he wasn't so sure. And he was right 
there too. Things are looking up, Mr. Frodo. Haven't you got some hope now?' 

'Well no, not much, Sam,' Frodo sighed. 'That's away beyond the 
mountains. We're going east not west. And I'm so tired. And the Ring is so 
heavy, Sam. And I begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great 
wheel of fire.' 

Sam's quick spirits sank again at once. He looked at his master 
anxiously, and he took his hand. 'Come, Mr. Frodo!' he said. 'I've got one 
thing I wanted: a bit of light. Enough to help us, and yet I guess it's 
dangerous too. Try a bit further, and then we'll lie close and have a rest. 

But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the Elves' food; it may hearten you.' 

Sharing a wafer of lembas, and munching it as best they could with 
their parched mouths. Frodo and Sam plodded on. The light, though no more 
than a grey dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the 
valley between the mountains. It sloped up gently northward, and at its 
bottom went the bed of a now dry and withered stream. Beyond its stony 
course they saw a beaten path that wound its way under the feet of the 
westward cliffs. Had they known, they could have reached it quicker, for it 
was a track that left the main Morgul-road at the western bridge-end and 
went down by a long stair cut in the rock to the valley's bottom. It was 
used by patrols or by messengers going swiftly to lesser posts and 
strongholds north-away, between Cirith Ungol and the narrows of Isenmouthe, 
the iron jaws of Carach Angren. 

It was perilous for the hobbits to use such a path, but they needed 
speed, and Frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling among 
the boulders or in the trackless glens of the Morgai. And he judged that 
northward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would least expect them to 
take. The road east to the plain, or the pass back westward, those they 
would first search most thoroughly. Only when he was well north of the Tower 
did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east, east on the last 
desperate stage of his journey. So now they crossed the stony bed and took 
to the ore -path, and for some time they marched along it. The cliffs at 
their left were overhung, and they could not be seen from above; but the 
path made many bends, and at each bend they gripped their sword-hilts and 
went forward cautiously. 




The light grew no stronger, for Orodruin was still belching forth a 
great fume that, beaten upwards by the opposing airs, mounted higher and 
higher, until it reached a region above the wind and spread in an 
immeasurable roof, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their 
view. They had trudged for more than an hour when they heard a sound that 
brought them to a halt. Unbelievable, but unmistakable. Water trickling. Out 
of a gully on the left, so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black 
cliff had been cloven by some huge axe, water came dripping down: the last 
remains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered from sunlit seas, but ill-fated 
to fall at last upon the walls of the Black Land and wander fruitless down 
into the dust. Here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet, 
and flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly to be lost 
among the dead stones. 

Sam sprang towards it. 'If ever I see the Lady again, I will tell her!' 
he cried. 'Light and now water!' Then he stopped. 'Let me drink first Mr. 
Frodo,' he said. 

'All right, but there's room enough for two.' 

'I didn't mean that,' said Sam. 'I mean: if it's poisonous, or 
something that will show its badness quick, well, better me than you, 
master, if you understand me.' 

'I do. But I think we'll trust our luck together, Sam; or our blessing. 

Still, be careful now, if it's very cold!' 

The water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, at once 
bitter and oily, or so they would have said at home. Here it seemed beyond 
all praise, and beyond fear or prudence. They drank their fill, and Sam 
replenished his water-bottle. After that Frodo felt easier, and they went on 
for several miles, until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a 
rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another 
ore-hold. 

'This is where we turn aside, Sam,' said Frodo. 'And we must turn 
east.' He sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley. 'I 
have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there. And 
then I must rest a little.' 

The river-bed was now some way below the path. They scrambled down to 
it, and began to cross it. To their surprise they came upon dark pools fed 
by threads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley. 




Upon its outer marges under the westward mountains Mordor was a dying 
land, 

but it was not yet dead. And here things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter, 
struggling for life. In the glens of the Morgai on the other side of the 
valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought 
with the stones, and withered mosses crawled on them; and everywhere great 
writhing, tangled brambles sprawled. Some had long stabbing thorns, some 
hooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen shrivelled leaves of a past 
year hung on them, grating and rattling in the sad airs, but their 
maggot-ridden buds were only just opening. Flies, dun or grey, or black, 
marked like ores with a red eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung; and above 
the briar -thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled. 

'Ore -gear's no good,' said Sam, waving his arms. 'I wish I'd got an 
ore's hide!' 

At last Frodo could go no further. They had climbed up a narrow 
shelving ravine, but they still had a long way to go before they could even 
come in sight of the last craggy ridge. 'I must rest now, Sam, and sleep if 
I can.' said Frodo. He looked about, but there seemed nowhere even for an 
animal to crawl into in this dismal country. At length, tired out, they 
slunk under a curtain of brambles that hung down like a mat over a low 
rock-face. 

There they sat and made such a meal as they could. Keeping back the 
precious lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained 
in Sam's bag of Faramir's provision: some dried fruit, and a small slip of 
cured meat; and they sipped some water. They had drunk again from the pools 
in the valley, but they were very, thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in 
the air of Mordor that dried the mouth. When Sam thought of water even his 
hopeful spirit quailed. Beyond the Morgai there was the dreadful plain of 
Gorgoroth to cross. 

'Now you go to sleep first, Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'It's getting dark 
again. I reckon this day is nearly over.' 

Frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. Sam 
struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat 
silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled 
from the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and 
cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. Far 
above the Ephel D®ath in the West the night- sky was still dim and pale. 




There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the 
mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote 
his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to 
him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the 
end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high 
beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower had been defiance 
rather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, 
his own fate, and even his masters, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back 
into the brambles and laid himself by Frodo's side, and putting away all 
fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep. 

They woke together, hand in hand. Sam was almost fresh, ready for 
another day; but Frodo sighed. His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of 
fire, and waking brought him no comfort. Still his sleep had not been 
without all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able to bear his burden 
one stage further. They did not know the time, nor how long they had slept; 
but after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravine, 
until it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones. There the last 
living things gave up their struggle; the tops of the Morgai were grassless, 
bare, jagged, barren as a slate. 

After much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb, 
and with a last hundred feet of clawing scramble they were up. They came to 
a cleft between two dark crags, and passing through found themselves on the 
very edge of the last fence of Mordor. Below them, at the bottom of a fall 
of some fifteen hundred feet, lay the inner plain stretching away into a 
formless gloom beyond their sight. The wind of the world blew now from the 
West, and the great clouds were lifted high, floating away eastward; but 
still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of Gorgoroth. There smokes 
trailed on the ground and lurked in hollows, and fumes leaked from fissures 
in the earth. 

Still far away, forty miles at least, they saw Mount Doom, its feet 
founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its 
reeking head was swathed in cloud. Its fires were now dimmed, and it stood 
in smouldering slumber, as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast. 
Behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of 
Barad-dyr that was reared far way upon a long spur of the Ashen Mountains 
thrust down from the North. The Dark Power was deep in thought, and the Eye 
turned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a bright sword, and a 




stern and kingly face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to 
other things; and all its great stronghold, gate on gate, and tower on 
tower, was wrapped in a brooding gloom. 

Frodo and Sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful 
land. Between them and the smoking mountain, and about it north and south, 
all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned and choked. They wondered 
how 

the Lord of this realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies. Yet 
armies he had. As far as their eyes could reach, along the skirts of the 
Morgai and away southward, there were camps, some of tents, some ordered 
like small towns. One of the largest of these was right below them. Barely a 
mile out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with 
straight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings. About it the 
ground was busy with folk going to and fro; a wide road ran from it 
south-east to join the Morgul-way, and along it many lines of small black 
shapes were hurrying. 

'I don’t like the look of things at all,' said Sam. ’Pretty hopeless, I 
call it - saving that where there's such a lot of folk there must be wells 
or water, not to mention food. And these are Men not Ores, or my eyes are 
all wrong.’ 

Neither he nor Frodo knew anything of the great slave- worked fields 
away south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the Mountain by the dark 
sad waters of Lake N®rnen; nor of the great roads that ran away east and 
south to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower brought long 
waggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves. Here in the northward 
regions were the mines and forges, and the musterings of long-planned war; 
and here the Dark Power, moving its armies like pieces on the board, was 
gathering them together. Its first moves, the first feelers of its strength, 
had been checked upon its western line, southward and northward. For the 
moment it withdrew them, and brought up new forces, massing them about 
Cirith Gorgor for an avenging stroke. And if it had also been its purpose to 
defend the Mountain against all approach, it could scarcely have done more. 

’Well!’ Sam went on. ’Whatever they have to eat and drink, we can't get 
it. There's no way down that I can see. And we couldn’t cross all that open 
country crawling with enemies, even if we did get down.' 

’Still we shall have to try,' said Frodo. 'It's no worse than I 
expected. I never hoped to get across. I can't see any hope of it now. But 




I've still got to do the best I can. At present that is to avoid being 
captured as long as possible. So we must still go northwards, I think, and 
see what it is like where the open plain is narrower.' 

’I guess what it'll be like,' said Sam. 'Where it's narrower the Ores 
and Men will just be packed closer. You'll see, Mr. Frodo.' 

'I dare say I shall, if we ever get so far,' said Frodo and turned 
away. 

They soon found that it was impossible to make their way along the 
crest of the Morgai, or anywhere along its higher levels, pathless as they 
were and scored with deep ghylls. In the end they were forced to go back 
down the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley. 

It was rough going, for they dared not cross over to the path on the 
westward side. After a mile or more they saw, huddled in a hollow at the 
cliffs foot, the ore-hold that they had guessed was near at hand: a wall 
and a cluster of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave. There was no 
movement to be seen, but the hobbits crept by cautiously, keeping as much as 
they could to the thorn-brakes that grew thickly at this point along both 
sides of the old water -course. 

They went two or three miles further, and the ore-hold was hidden from 
sight behind them; but they had hardly begun to breathe more freely again 
when harsh and loud they heard ore- voices. Quickly they slunk out of sight 
behind a brown and stunted bush. The voices drew nearer. Presently two ores 
came into view. One was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of 
horn; it was of a small breed, black -skinned, with wide and snuffling 
nostrils: evidently a tracker of some kind. The other was a big 
fighting-ore, like those of Shagrat's company, bearing the token of the Eye. 

He also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad-headed spear. As 
usual they were quarrelling, and being of different breeds they used the 
Common Speech after their fashion. 

Hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small ore 
stopped. 'Nar!' it snarled. 'I'm going home.' It pointed across the valley 
to the ore-hold. 'No good wearing my nose out on stones any more. There's 
not a trace left, I say. I've lost the scent through giving way to you. It 
went up into the hills, not along the valley, I tell you.' 

'Not much use are you, you little snufflers?' said the big ore. 'I 
reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses.' 

'Then what have you seen with them?' snarled the other. 'Garn! You 




don’t even know what you're looking for.' 

'Whose blame's that?' said the soldier. 'Not mine. That comes from 
Higher Up. First they say it's a great Elf in bright armour, then it's a 
sort of small dwarf-man, then it must be a pack of rebel Uruk-hai; or maybe 
it's all the lot together.' 

'Ar !' said the tracker. 'They've lost their heads, that's what it is. 

And some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too, I guess, if what I 
hear is true: Tower raided and all, and hundreds of your lads done in, and 
prisoner got away. If that's the way you fighters go on, small wonder 
there's bad news from the battles.' 

'Who says there's bad news?' shouted the soldier. 

'Ar! Who says there isn't?' 

'That's cursed rebel-talk, and I'll stick you, if you don't shut it 
down, see?' 

'All right, all right!' said the tracker. 'I'll say no more and go on 
thinking. But what's the black sneak got to do with it all? That gobbler 
with the flapping hands?' 

'I don't know. Nothing, maybe. But he's up to no good, nosing around, 
I'll wager. Curse him! No sooner had he slipped us and run off than word 
came he's wanted alive, wanted quick.' 

'Well, I hope they get him and put him through it,' growled the 
tracker. 'He messed up the scent back there, pinching that cast-off 
mail-shirt that he found, and paddling all round the place before I could 
get there.' 

'It saved his life anyhow,' said the soldier. 'Why, before I knew he 
was wanted I shot him, as neat as neat, at fifty paces right in the back; 
but he ran on.' 

'Garn! You missed him,' said the tracker. 'First you shoot wild, then 
you run too slow, and then you send for the poor trackers. I've had enough 
of you.' He loped off. 

'You come back,' shouted the soldier, 'or I'll report you!' 

'Who to? Not to your precious Shagrat. He won't be captain any more.' 

'I'll give your name and number to the Nazgyl,' said the soldier 
lowering his voice to a hiss. 'One of them ' s in charge at the Tower now.' 

The other halted, and his voice was full of fear and rage. 'You cursed 
peaching sneakthief!' he yelled. 'You can't do your job, and you can't even 
stick by your own folk. Go to your filthy Shriekers, and may they freeze the 




flesh off you! If the enemy doesn’t get them first. They've done in Number 
One, I've heard, and I hope it's true!' 

The big ore, spear in hand, leapt after him. But the tracker, springing 
behind a stone, put an arrow in his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a 
crash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared. 

For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length Sam stirred. 'Well I 
call that neat as neat,' he said. 'If this nice friendliness would spread 
about in Mordor, half our trouble would be over.' 

'Quietly, Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'There may be others about. We have 
evidently had a very narrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks 
than we guessed. But that is the spirit of Mordor, Sam; and it has spread to 
every corner of it. Ores have always behaved like that, or so all tales say, 
when they are on their own. But you can't get much hope out of it. They hate 
us far more, altogether and all the time. If those two had seen us, they 
would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.' 

There was another long silence. Sam broke it again, but with a whisper 
this time. 'Did you hear what they said about that gobbler , Mr. Frodo? I 
told you Gollum wasn't dead yet, didn't I?' 

'Yes, I remember. And I wondered how you knew,' said Frodo. 'Well come 
now! I think we had better not move out from here again, until it has gone 
quite dark. So you shall tell me how you know, and all about what happened. 
If you can do it quietly.' 

'I'll try,' said Sam, 'but when I think of that Stinker I get so hot 1 
could shout.' 

There the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush, while the 
drear light of Mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night; and Sam 
spoke into Frodo's ear all that he could find words for of Gollum's 
treacherous attack, the horror of Shelob, and his own adventures with the 
ores. When he had finished, Frodo said nothing but took Sam's hand and 
pressed it. At length he stirred. 

'Well, I suppose we must be going on again,' he said. 'I wonder how 
long it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and the 
slinking will be over, and in vain.' He stood up. 'It's dark, and we cannot 
use the Lady's glass. Keep it safe for me, Sam. I have nowhere to keep it 
now, except in my hand, and I shall need both hands in the blind night. But 
Sting I give to you. I have got an ore -blade, but I do not think it will be 
my part to strike any blow again.' 




It was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless 
land; but slowly and with much stumbling the two hobbits toiled on hour by 
hour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley. When a grey light 
crept back over the western heights, long after day had opened in the lands 
beyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. In his 
times of waking Sam was busy with thoughts of food. At last when Frodo 
roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet another effort, 
he asked the question that was troubling him most. 

'Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he said, 'but have you any notion how 
far there is still to go?' 

'No, not any clear notion, Sam,' Frodo answered. 'In Rivendell before I 
set out I was shown a map of Mordor that was made before the Enemy came 
back 

here; but I only remember it vaguely. I remember clearest that there was a 
place in the north where the western range and the northern range send out 
spurs that nearly meet. That must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge 
back by the Tower. It might be a good point at which to cross. But of 
course, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the Mountain, 
sixty miles from it, I should think. I guess that we have gone about twelve 
leagues north from the bridge now. Even if all goes well, I could hardly 
reach the Mountain in a week. I am afraid, Sam, that the burden will get 
very heavy, and I shall go still slower as we get nearer.' 

Sam sighed. 'That's just as I feared,' he said. 'Well, to say nothing 
of water, we've got to eat less, Mr. Frodo, or else move a bit quicker, at 
any rate while we're still in this valley. One more bite and all the food's 
ended, save the Elves' waybread.' 

'I'll try and be a bit quicker, Sam,' said Frodo, drawing a deep 
breath. 'Come on then! Let's start another march!' 

It was not yet quite dark again. They plodded along, on into the night. 

The hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts. At the 
first hint of grey light under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid 
themselves again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stone. 

Slowly the light grew, until it was clearer than it yet had been. A 
strong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor from the 
upper 

airs. Before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for some 
miles about them. The trough between the mountains and the Morgai had 




steadily dwindled as it climbed upwards, and the inner ridge was now no more 
than a shelf in the steep faces of the Ephel D®ath; but to the east it fell 
as sheerly as ever down into Gorgoroth. Ahead the water-course came to an 
end in broken steps of rock; for out from the main range there sprang a high 
barren spur, thrusting eastward like a wall. To meet it there stretched out 
from the grey and misty northern range of Ered Lithui a long jutting arm; 
and between the ends there was a narrow gap: Carach Angren, the Isenmouthe, 
beyond which lay the deep dale of Udyn. In that dale behind the Morannon 
were the tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of Mordor had made for 
the defence of the Black Gate of their land; and there now their Lord was 
gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the 
West. Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and watch-fires 
burned; and all across the gap an earth-wall had been raised, and a deep 
trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge. 

A few miles north, high up in the angle where the western spur branched 
away from the main range, stood the old castle of Durthang, now one of the 
many ore-holds that clustered about the dale of Udyn. A road, already 
visible in the growing light, came winding down from it, until only a mile 
or two from where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along a shelf cut 
in the side of the spur, and so went down into the plain, and on to the 
Isenmouthe. 

To the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey 
north had been useless. The plain to their right was dim and smoky, and they 
could see there neither camps nor troops moving; but all that region was 
under the vigilance of the forts of Carach Angren. 

'We have come to a dead end, Sam,' said Frodo. 'If we go on, we shall 
only come up to that ore-tower, but the only road to take is that road that 
comes down from it - unless we go back. We can't climb up westward, or climb 
down eastward.' 

'Then we must take the road, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'We must take it and 
chance our luck, if there is any luck in Mordor. We might as well give 
ourselves up as wander about any more, or try to go back. Our food won't 
last. We've got to make a dash for it!' 

'All right, Sam,' said Frodo. 'Lead me! As long as you've got any hope 
left. Mine is gone. But I can't dash, Sam. I'll just plod along after you.' 

'Before you start any more plodding, you need sleep and food, Mr. 

Frodo. Come and take what you can get of them!' 




He gave Frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread, and he 
made a pillow of his cloak for his master's head. Frodo was too weary to 
debate the matter, and Sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop 
of their water, and eaten Sam's share of the food as well as his own. When 
Frodo was asleep Sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned 
his face. It was lined and thin, and yet in sleep it looked content and 
unafraid. 'Well, here goes, Master!' Sam muttered to himself. 'I'll have to 
leave you for a bit and trust to luck. Water we must have, or we'll get no 
further.' 

Sam crept out, and flitting from stone to stone with more than 
hobbit-care, he went down to the water -course, and then followed it for some 
way as it climbed north, until he came to the rock-steps where long ago, no 
doubt, its spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall. All now 
seemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair Sam stooped and listened, and 
to his delight he caught the sound of trickling. Clambering a few steps up 
he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out from the hill-side and 
filled a little bare pool, from which again it spilled, and vanished then 
under the barren stones. 

Sam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then he drank deeply, 
refilled the bottle, and turned to go back. At that moment he caught a 
glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near Frodo's 
hiding-place. Biting back a cry, he leapt down from the spring and ran, 
jumping from stone to stone. It was a wary creature, difficult to see, but 
Sam had little doubt about it: he longed to get his hands on its neck. But 
it heard him coming and slipped quickly away. Sam thought he saw a last 
fleeting glimpse of it, peering back over the edge of the eastward 
precipice, before it ducked and disappeared. 

'Well, luck did not let me down,' muttered Sam, 'but that was a near 
thing! Isn't it enough to have ores by the thousand without that stinking 
villain coming nosing round? I wish he had been shot!' He sat down by Frodo 
and did not rouse him; but he did not dare to go to sleep himself. At last 
when he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could 
not go on much longer, he wakened Frodo gently. 

'That Gollum's about again, I'm afraid, Mr. Frodo,' he said. 
'Leastways, if it wasn't him, then there's two of him. I went away to find 
some water and spied him nosing round just as I turned back. I reckon it 
isn't safe for us both to sleep together, and begging your pardon, but I 




can't hold up my lids much longer.' 

'Bless you, Sam!' said Frodo. 'Lie down and take your proper turn! But 
I'd rather have Gollum than ores. At any rate he won't give us away to them 
- not unless he's caught himself.' 

'But he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own,' growled Sam. 
'Keep your eyes open, Mr. Frodo! There's a bottle full of water. Drink up. 

We can fill it again when we go on.' With that Sam plunged into sleep. 

Light was fading when he woke. Frodo sat propped against the rock 
behind, but he had fallen asleep. The water-bottle was empty. There was no 
sign of Gollum. 

Mordor-dark had returned, and the watch-fires on the heights burned 
fierce and red, when the hobbits set out again on the most dangerous stage 
of all their journey. They went first to the little spring, and then 
climbing warily up they came to the road at the point where it swung east 
towards the Isenmouthe twenty miles away. It was not a broad road, and it 
had no wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from 
its brink became deeper and deeper. The hobbits could hear no movements, and 
after listening for a while they set off eastward at a steady pace. 

After doing some twelve miles, they halted. A short way back the road 
had bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed over was 
now screened from sight. This proved disastrous. They rested for some 
minutes and then went on; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in 
the stillness of the night they heard the sound that all along they had 
secretly dreaded: the noise of marching feet. It was still some way behind 
them, but looking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming round 
the bend less than a mile away, and they were moving fast: too fast for 
Frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead. 

'I feared it, Sam,' said Frodo. 'We've trusted to luck, and it has 
failed us. We're trapped.' He looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where 
the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their 
heads. He ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of 
gloom. 'We're trapped at last!' he said He sank to the ground beneath the 
wall of rock and bowed his head. 

'Seems so,' said Sam. 'Well, we can but wait and see.' And with that he 
sat down beside Frodo under the shadow of the cliff. 

They did not have to wait long. The ores were going at a great pace. 

Those in the foremost files bore torches. On they came, red flames in the 




dark, swiftly growing. Now Sam too bowed his head, hoping that it would hide 
his face when the torches reached them; and he set their shields before 
their knees to hide their feet. 

'If only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers 
alone and pass on!' he thought. 

And so it seemed that they would. The leading ores came loping along, 
panting, holding their heads down. They were a gang of the smaller breeds 
being driven unwilling to their Dark Lord's wars; all they cared for was to 
get the march over and escape the whip. Beside them, running up and down the 
line, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and shouting. File 
after file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead. 

Sam held his breath. Now more than half the line had gone by. Then suddenly 
one of the slave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side. He flicked 
a whip at them and yelled: 'Hi, you! Get up!' They did not answer, and with 
a shout he halted the whole company. 

'Come on, you slugs!' he cried. 'This is no time for slouching.' He 
took a step towards them, and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on 
their shields. 'Deserting, eh?' he snarled. 'Or thinking of it? All your 
folk should have been inside Udyn before yesterday evening. You know that. 
Up you get and fall in, or I'll have your numbers and report you.' 

They struggled to their feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore 
soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear of the line. 'No, not at the 
rear!' the slave-driver shouted. 'Three files up. And stay there, or you'll 
know it, when I come down the line!' He sent his long whip-lash cracking 
over their heads; then with another crack and a yell he started the company 
off again at a brisk trot. 

It was hard enough for poor Sam, tired as he was; but for Frodo it was 
a torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop his mind 
from thinking, and he struggled on. The stench of the sweating ores about 
him was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. On, on they went, and he 
bent all his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going; and 
yet to what evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. There 
was no hope of falling out unseen: Now and again the ore-driver fell back 
and jeered at them. 

'There now!' he laughed, flicking at their legs. 'Where there's a whip 
there's a will, my slugs. Hold up! I'd give you a nice freshener now, only 
you'll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to 




your camp. Do you good. Don’t you know we’re at war?' 

They had gone some miles, and the road was at last running down a long 
slope into the plain, when Frodo’s strength began to give out and his will 
wavered. He lurched and stumbled. Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold 
him up, though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much 
longer. At any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master 
would 

faint or fall, and all would be discovered, and their bitter efforts be in 
vain. 'I'll have that big slave-driving devil anyway,' he thought. 

Then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword, there 
came an unexpected relief. They were out on the plain now and drawing near 
the entrance to Udyn. Some way in front of it, before the gate at the 
bridge-end, the road from the west converged with others coming from the 
south, and from Barad-dyr. Along all the roads troops were moving; for the 
Captains of the West were advancing and the Dark Lord was speeding his 
forces north. So it chanced that several companies came together at the 
road-meeting, in the dark beyond the light of the watch-fires on the wall. 

At once there was great jostling and cursing as each troop tried to get 
first to the gate and the ending of their march. Though the drivers yelled 
and plied their whips, scuffles broke out and some blades were drawn. A 
troop of heavy -armed uruks from Barad-dyr charged into the Durthang line and 
threw them into confusion. 

Dazed as he was with pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly 
at his chance, and threw himself to the ground, dragging Frodo down with 
him. Ores fell over them, snarling and cursing. Slowly on hand and knee the 
hobbits crawled away out of the turmoil, until at last unnoticed they 
dropped over the further edge of the road. It had a high kerb by which 
troop-leaders could guide themselves in black night or fog, and it was 
banked up some feet above the level of the open land. 

They lay still for a while. It was too dark to seek for cover, if 
indeed there was any to find; but Sam felt that they ought at least to get 
further away from the highways and out of the range of torch-light. 

'Come on, Mr. Frodo!' he whispered. 'One more crawl, and then you can 
lie still.' 

With a last despairing effort Frodo raised himself on his hands, and 
struggled on for maybe twenty yards. Then he pitched down into a shallow pit 
that opened unexpectedly before them, and there he lay like a dead thing. 




Chapter 3 . Mount Doom 



Sam put his ragged orc-cloak under his master's head, and covered them 
both with the grey robe of Lurien; and as he did so his thoughts went out to 
that fair land, and to the Elves, and he hoped that the cloth woven by their 
hands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this 
wilderness of fear. He heard the scuffling and cries die down as the troops 
passed on through the Isenmouthe. It seemed that in the confusion and the 
mingling of many companies of various kinds they had not been missed, not 
yet at any rate. 

Sam took a sip of water, but pressed Frodo to drink, and when his 
master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious 
waybread and made him eat it. Then, too worn out even to feel much fear, 
they stretched themselves out. They slept a little in uneasy fits; for their 
sweat grew chill on them, and the hard stones bit them, and they shivered. 
Out of the north from the Black Gate through Cirith Gorgor there flowed 
whispering along the ground a thin cold air. 

In the morning a grey light came again, for in the high regions the 
West Wind still blew, but down on the stones behind the fences of the Black 
Land the air seemed almost dead, chill and yet stifling. Sam looked up out 
of the hollow. The land all about was dreary, flat and drab-hued. On the 
roads nearby nothing was moving now; but Sam feared the watchful eyes on 
the 

wall of the Isenmouthe, no more than a furlong away northward. 
South-eastward, far off like a dark standing shadow, loomed the Mountain. 
Smokes were pouring from it and while those that rose into the upper air 
trailed away eastward, great rolling clouds floated down its sides and 
spread over the land. A few miles to the north-east the foothills of the 
Ashen Mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts, behind which the misty 
northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the 
lowering sky. 

Sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to 
take. It looks every step of fifty miles,’ he muttered gloomily staring at 
the threatening mountain, 'and that'll take a week, if it takes a day, with 
Mr. Frodo as he is.' He shook his head, and as he worked things out, slowly 




a new dark thought grew in his mind. Never for long had hope died in his 
staunch heart, and always until now he had taken some thought for their 
return. But the bitter truth came home to him at last: at best their 
provision would take them to their goal; and when the task was done, there 
they would come to an end, alone, houseless, foodless in the midst of a 
terrible desert. There could be no return. 

’So that was the job I felt I had to do when I started,' thought Sam: 

'to help Mr. Frodo to the last step and then die with him? Well, if that is 
the job then I must do it. But I would dearly like to see By water again, and 
Rosie Cotton and her brothers, and the Gaffer and Marigold and all. I can't 
think somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there 
hadn't a' been any hope of his ever coming back at all. Things all went 
wrong when he went down in Moria. I wish he hadn't. He would have done 
something.' 

But even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to die, it was turned to a new 
strength. Sam's plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost grim, as the will 
hardened in him, and he felt through all his limbs a thrill, as if he was 
turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor 
weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue. 

With a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the 
ground near at hand, studying the next move. As the light grew a little he 
saw to his surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and 
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled. Indeed the whole 
surface of the plains of Gorgoroth was pocked with great holes, as if, while 
it was still a waste of soft mud, it had been smitten with a shower of bolts 
and huge slingstones. The largest of these holes were rimmed with ridges of 
broken rock, and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions. It was 
a land in which it would be possible to creep from hiding to hiding, unseen 
by all but the most watchful eyes: possible at least for one who was strong 
and had no need for speed. For the hungry and worn, who had far to go before 
life failed, it had an evil look. 

Thinking of all these things Sam went back to his master. He had no 
need to rouse him. Frodo was lying on his back with eyes open, staring at 
the cloudy sky. 'Well, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'I've been having a look round 
and thinking a bit. There's nothing on the roads, and we'd best be getting 
away while there's a chance. Can you manage it?' 

'I can manage it,' said Frodo. 'I must.' 




Once more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting behind 
such cover as they could find, but moving always in a slant towards the 
foothills of the northern range. But as they went the most easterly of the 
roads followed them, until it ran off, hugging the skirts of the mountains, 
away into a wall of black shadow far ahead. Neither man nor ore now moved 
along its flat grey stretches; for the Dark Lord had almost completed the 
movement of his forces, and even in the fastness of his own realm he sought 
the secrecy of night, fearing the winds of the world that had turned against 
him, tearing aside his veils, and troubled with tidings of bold spies that 
had passed through his fences. 

The hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted. Frodo seemed 
nearly spent. Sam saw that he could not go much further in this fashion, 
crawling, stooping, now picking a doubtful way very slowly, now hurrying at 
a stumbling run. 

'I'm going back on to the road while the light lasts, Mr. Frodo,' he 
said. 'Trust to luck again! It nearly failed us last time, but it didn't 
quite. A steady pace for a few more miles, and then a rest.' 

He was taking a far greater risk than he knew; but Frodo was too much 
occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to debate, and 
almost too hopeless to care. They climbed on to the causeway and trudged 
along, down the hard cruel road that led to the Dark Tower itself. But their 
luck held, and for the rest of that day they met no living or moving thing; 
and when night fell they vanished into the darkness of Mordor. All the land 
now brooded as at the coming of a great storm: for the Captains of the West 
had passed the Cross-roads and set flames in the deadly fields of Imlad 
Morgul. 

So the desperate journey went on, as the Ring went south and the 
banners of the kings rode north. For the hobbits each day, each mile, was 
more bitter than the one before, as their strength lessened and the land 
became more evil. They met no enemies by day. At times by night, as they 
cowered or drowsed uneasily in some hiding beside the road, they heard cries 
and the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cruelly ridden 
steed. But far worse than all such perils was the ever -approaching threat 
that beat upon them as they went: the dreadful menace of the Power that 
waited, brooding in deep thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil 
about its Throne. Nearer and nearer it drew, looming blacker, like the 
oncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world. 




There came at last a dreadful nightfall; and even as the Captains of 
the West drew near to the end of the living lands, the two wanderers came to 
an hour of blank despair. Four days had passed since they had escaped from 
the ores, but the time lay behind them like an ever -darkening dream. All 
this last day Frodo had not spoken, but had walked half-bowed, often 
stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet. Sam guessed 
that among all their pains he bore the worst, the growing weight of the 
Ring, a burden on the body and a torment to his mind. Anxiously Sam had 
noted how his master's left hand would often be raised as if to ward on a 
blow, or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful Eye that sought to 
look in them. And sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast, 
clutching, and then slowly, as the will recovered mastery, it would be 
withdrawn. 

Now as the blackness of night returned Frodo sat, his head between his 
knees, his arms hanging wearily to the ground where his hands lay feebly 
twitching. Sam watched him, till night covered them both and hid them from 
one another. Fie could no longer find any words to say; and he turned to his 
own dark thoughts. As for himself, though weary and under a shadow of fear, 
he still had some strength left. The lembas had a virtue without which they 
would long ago have lain down to die. It did not satisfy desire, and at 
times Sam's mind was filled with the memories of food, and the longing for 
simple bread and meats. And yet this way bread of the Elves had a potency 
that increased as travellers relied on it alone and did not mingle it with 
other foods. It fed the will, and it gave strength to endure, and to master 
sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind. But now a new decision 
must be made. They could not follow this road any longer; for it went on 
eastward into the great Shadow, but the Mountain now loomed upon their 
right, almost due south, and they must turn towards it. Yet still before it 
there stretched a wide region of fuming, barren, ash-ridden land. 

'Water, water!' muttered Sam. He had stinted himself, and in his 
parched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his care they 
now had very little left, perhaps half his bottle, and maybe there were 
still days to go. All would long ago have been spent, if they had not dared 
to follow the ore-road. For at long intervals on that highway cisterns had 
been built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless 
regions. In one Sam had found some water left, stale, muddied by the ores, 
but still sufficient for their desperate case. Yet that was now a day ago. 




There was no hope of any more. 

At last wearied with his cares Sam drowsed, leaving the morrow till it 
came; he could do no more. Dream and waking mingled uneasily. He saw 
lights 

like gloating yes, and dark creeping shapes, and he heard noises as of wild 
beasts or the dreadful cries of tortured things; and he would start up to 
find the world all dark and only empty blackness all about him. Once only, 
as he stood and stared wildly round, did it seem that, though now awake, he 
could still see pale lights like eyes; but soon they flickered and vanished. 

The hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly. Such daylight as 
followed was dim; for here as the Mountain drew near the air was ever mirky, 
while out from the Dark Tower there crept the veils of Shadow that Sauron 
wove about himself. Frodo was lying on his back not moving. Sam stood 
beside 

him, reluctant to speak, and yet knowing that the word now lay with him: he 
must set his master's will to work for another effort. At length, stooping 
and caressing Frodo's brow, he spoke in his ear. 

'Wake up, Master!' he said. 'Time for another start.' 

As if roused by a sudden bell, Frodo rose quickly, and stood up and 
looked away southwards; but when his eyes beheld the Mountain and the desert 
he quailed again. 

'I can't manage it, Sam,' he said. 'It is such a weight to carry, such 
a weight.' 

Sam knew before he spoke, that it was vain, and that such words might 
do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not keep silent. 'Then let 
me carry it a bit for you, Master,' he said. 'You know I would, and gladly, 
as long as I have any strength.' 

A wild light came into Frodo's eyes. 'Stand away! Don't touch me!' he 
cried. 'It is mine, I say. Be off!' His hand strayed to his sword-hilt. But 
then quickly his voice changed. 'No, no, Sam,' he said sadly. 'But you must 
understand. It is my burden, and no one else can bear it. It is too late 
now, Sam dear. You can't help me in that way again. I am almost in its power 
now. I could not give it up, and if you tried to take it I should go mad.' 

Sam nodded. 'I understand,' he said. 'But I've been thinking, Mr. 

Frodo, there's other things we might do without. Why not lighten the load a 
bit? We're going that way now, as straight as we can make it.' He pointed to 
the Mountain. 'It's no good taking anything we're not sure to need.' 




Frodo looked again towards the Mountain. 'No,' he said, ’we shan't need 
much on that road. And at its end nothing.' Picking up his ore-shield he 
flung it away and threw his helmet after it. Then pulling off the grey cloak 
he undid the heavy belt and let it fall to the ground, and the sheathed 
sword with it. The shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered. 

'There, I'll be an ore no more,' he cried, 'and I'll bear no weapon 
fair or foul. Let them take me, if they will!' 

Sam did likewise, and put aside his ore-gear; and he took out all the 
things in his pack. Somehow each of them had become dear to him, if only 
because he had borne them so far with so much toil. Hardest of all it was to 
part with his cooking-gear. Tears welled in his eyes at the thought of 
casting it away. 

'Do you remember that bit of rabbit, Mr. Frodo?' he said. 'And our 
place under the warm bank in Captain Faramir's country, the day I saw an 
oliphaunt?' 

'No, I am afraid not, Sam,' said Frodo. 'At least, I know that such 
things happened, but I cannot see them. No taste of food, no feel of water, 
no sound of wind, no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or 
star are left to me. I am naked in the dark. Sam, and there is no veil 
between me and the wheel of fire. I begin to see it even with my waking 
eyes, and all else fades.' 

Sam went to him and kissed his hand. 'Then the sooner we're rid of it, 
the sooner to rest,' he said haltingly, finding no better words to say. 

'Talking won't mend nothing,' he muttered to himself, as he gathered up all 
the things that they had chosen to cast away. He was not willing to leave 
them lying open in the wilderness for any eyes to see. 'Stinker picked up 
that ore-shirt, seemingly, and he isn't going to add a sword to it. His 
hands are bad enough when empty. And he isn't going to mess with my pans!' 
With that he carried all the gear away to one of the many gaping fissures 
that scored the land and threw them in. The clatter of his precious pans as 
they fell down into the dark was like a death-knell to his heart. 

He came back to Frodo, and then of his elven-rope he cut a short piece 
to serve his master as a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his 
waist. The rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack. Beside that he 
kept only the remnants of their waybread and the water-bottle, and Sting 
still hanging by his belt; and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his 
breast the phial of Galadriel and the little box that she gave him for his 




own. 

Now at last they turned their faces to the Mountain and set out, 
thinking no more of concealment, bending their weariness and failing wills 
only to the one task of going on. In the dimness of its dreary day few 
things even in that land of vigilance could have espied them, save from 
close at hand. Of all the slaves of the Dark Lord, only the Nazgyl could 
have warned him of the peril that crept, small but indomitable, into the 
very heart of his guarded realm. But the Nazgyl and their black wings were 
abroad on another errand: they were gathered far away, shadowing the march 
of the Captains of the West, and thither the thought of the Dark Tower was 
turned. 

That day it seemed to Sam that his master had found some new strength, 
more than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had 
to carry. In the first marches they went further and faster than he had 
hoped. The land was rough and hostile, and yet they made much progress, and 
ever the Mountain drew nearer. But as the day wore on and all too soon the 
dim light began to fail, Frodo stooped again, and began to stagger, as if 
the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength. 

At their last halt he sank down and said: Tm thirsty, Sam,’ and did 
not speak again. Sam gave him a mouthful of water; only one more mouthful 
remained. He went without himself; and now as once more the night of 
Mordor 

closed over them, through all his thoughts there came the memory of water; 
and every brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen, under green 
willow-shades or twinkling in the sun, danced and rippled for his torment 
behind the blindness of his eyes. He felt the cool mud about his toes as he 
paddled in the Pool at Bywater with Jolly Cotton and Tom and Nibs, and their 
sister Rosie. 'But that was years ago,' he sighed, 'and far away. The way 
back, if there is one, goes past the Mountain.' 

He could not sleep and he held a debate with himself. 'Well, come now, 
we've done better than you hoped,' he said sturdily. 'Began well anyway. I 
reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped. One more day will do 
it.' And then he paused. 

'Don't be a fool, Sam Gamgee,' came an answer in his own voice. 'He 
won't go another day like that, if he moves at all. And you can't go on much 
longer giving him all the water and most of the food.' 

'I can go on a good way though, and I will.' 




'Where to?' 

’To the Mountain, of course.' 

'But what then, Sam Gamgee, what then? When you get there, what are you 
going to do? He won't be able to do anything for himself.' 

To his dismay Sam realized that he had not got an answer to this. He 
had no clear idea at all. Frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand, 
and Sam only knew vaguely that the Ring had somehow to be put into the fire. 
'The Cracks of Doom,' he muttered, the old name rising to his mind. 'Well, 
if Master knows how to find them, I don't.' 

'There you are!' came the answer. 'It's all quite useless. He said so 
himself. You are the fool, going on hoping and toiling. You could have lain 
down and gone to sleep together days ago, if you hadn't been so dogged. But 
you'll die just the same, or worse. You might just as well lie down now and 
give it up. You'll never get to the top anyway.' 

'I'll get there, if I leave everything but my bones behind,' said Sam. 

'And I'll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart. So stop 
arguing!' 

At that moment Sam felt a tremor in the ground beneath him, and he 
heard or sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the 
earth. There was a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died 
away. The Mountain too slept uneasily. 

The last stage of their journey to Orodruin came, and it was a torment 
greater than Sam had ever thought that he could bear. He was in pain, and so 
parched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food. It remained 
dark, not only because of the smokes of the Mountain: there seemed to be a 
storm coming up, and away to the south-east there was a shimmer of 
lightnings under the black skies. Worst of all, the air was full of fumes; 
breathing was painful and difficult, and a dizziness came on them, so that 
they staggered and often fell. And yet their wills did not yield, and they 
struggled on. 

The Mountain crept up ever nearer, until, if they lifted their heavy 
heads, it filled all their sight, looming vast before them: a huge mass of 
ash and slag and burned stone, out of which a sheer-sided cone was raised 
into the clouds. Before the daylong dusk ended and true night came again 
they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet. 

With a gasp Frodo cast himself on the ground. Sam sat by him. To his 
surprise he felt tired but lighter, and his head seemed clear again. No more 




debates disturbed his mind. He knew all the arguments of despair and would 
not listen to them. His will was set, and only death would break it. He felt 
no longer either desire or need of sleep, but rather of watchfulness. He 
knew that all the hazards and perils were now drawing together to a point: 
the next day would be a day of doom, the day of final effort or disaster, 
the last gasp. 

But when would it come? The night seemed endless and timeless, minute 
after minute falling dead and adding up to no passing hour, bringing no 
change. Sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and no day 
would 

ever reappear. At last he groped for Frodo's hand. It was cold and 
trembling. His master was shivering. 

'I didn't ought to have left my blanket behind,' muttered Sam; and 
lying down he tried to comfort Frodo with his arms and body. Then sleep took 
him, and the dim fight of the last day of their quest found them side by 
side. The wind had fallen the day before as it shifted from the West, and 
now it came from the North and began to rise; and slowly the light of the 
unseen Sun filtered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay. 

'Now for it! Now for the last gasp!' said Sam as he struggled to his 
feet. He bent over Frodo, rousing him gently. Frodo groaned; but with a 
great effort of will he staggered up; and then he fell upon his knees again. 

He raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes of Mount Doom towering 
above him, and then pitifully he began to crawl forward on his hands. 

Sam looked at him and wept in his heart, but no tears came to his dry 
and stinging eyes. 'I said I'd carry him, if it broke my back,' he muttered, 

'and I will!' 

'Come, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I can't carry it for you, but I can carry 
you and it as well. So up you get! Come on, Mr. Frodo dear! Sam will give 
you a ride. Just tell him where to go, and he'll go.' 

As Frodo clung upon his back, arms loosely about his neck, legs clasped 
firmly under his arms, Sam staggered to his feet; and then to his amazement 
he felt the burden light. He had feared that he would have barely strength 
to lift his master alone, and beyond that he had expected to share in the 
dreadful dragging weight of the accursed Ring. But it was not so. Whether 
because Frodo was so worn by his long pains, wound of knife, and venomous 
sting, and sorrow, fear, and homeless wandering, or because some gift of 
final strength was given to him, Sam lifted Frodo with no more difficulty 




than if he were carrying a hobbit-child pig-a-back in some romp on the lawns 
or hayfields of the Shire. He took a deep breath and started off. 

They had reached the Mountain's foot on its northern side, and a little 
to the westward; there its long grey slopes, though broken, were not sheer. 
Frodo did not speak, and so Sam struggled on as best he could, having no 
guidance but the will to climb as high as might be before his strength gave 
out and his will broke. On he toiled, up and up, turning this way and that 
to lessen the slope, often stumbling forward, and at the last crawling like 
a snail with a heavy burden on its back. When his will could drive him no 
further, and his limbs gave way, he stopped and laid his master gently down. 

Frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath. It was easier to breathe up 
here above the reeks that coiled and drifted down below. ’Thank you, Sam,' 
he said in a cracked whisper. 'How far is there to go?' 

'I don't know,' said Sam, 'because I don't know where we're going.' 

He looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to see how far 
his last effort had brought him. The Mountain standing ominous and alone had 
looked taller than it was. Sam saw now that it was less lofty than the high 
passes of the Ephel D®ath which he and Frodo had scaled. The confused and 
tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three thousand feet above 
the plain, and above them was reared half as high again its tall central 
cone, like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater. But already 
Sam was more than half way up the base, and the plain of Gorgoroth was dim 
below him, wrapped in fume and shadow. As he looked up he would have 
given a 

shout, if his parched throat had allowed him; for amid the rugged humps and 
shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road. It climbed like a rising 
girdle from the west and wound snakelike about the Mountain, until before it 
went round out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern 
side. 

Sam could not see the course immediately above him, where it was 
lowest, for a steep slope went up from where he stood; but he guessed that 
if he could only struggle on just a little way further up, they would strike 
this path. A gleam of hope returned to him. They might conquer the Mountain 
yet. 'Why, it might have been put there a-purpose!' he said to himself. 'If 
it wasn't there, I'd have to say I was beaten in the end.' 

The path was not put there for the purposes of Sam. He did not know it, 
but he was looking at Sauron's Road from Barad-dyr to the Sammath Naur, the 




Chambers of Fire. Out from the Dark Tower's huge western gate it came over a 
deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron, and then passing into the plain it ran 
for a league between two smoking chasms, and so reached a long sloping 
causeway that led up on to the Mountain's eastern side. Thence, turning and 
encircling all its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high 
in the upper cone, but still far from the reeking summit, to a dark entrance 
that gazed back east straight to the Window of the Eye in Sauron’s 
shadow-mantled fortress. Often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the 
Mountain’s furnaces, always that road was repaired and cleaned again by the 
labours of countless ores. 

Sam drew a deep breath. There was a path, but how he was to get up the 
slope to it he did not know. First he must ease his aching back. Fie lay flat 
beside Frodo for a while. Neither spoke. Slowly the light grew. Suddenly a 
sense of urgency which he did not understand came to Sam. It was almost as 
if he had been called: 'Now, now, or it will be too late!' He braced himself 
and got up. Frodo also seemed to have felt the call. He struggled to his 
knees. 

'I'll crawl, Sam,' he gasped. 

So foot by foot, like small grey insects, they crept up the slope. They 
came to the path and found that it was broad, paved with broken rubble and 
beaten ash. Frodo clambered on to it, and then moved as if by some 
compulsion he turned slowly to face the East. Far off the shadows of Sauron 
hung; but torn by some gust of wind out of the world, or else moved by some 
great disquiet within, the mantling clouds swirled, and for a moment drew 
aside; and then he saw, rising black, blacker and darker than the vast 
shades amid which it stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the 
topmost tower of Barad-dyr. One moment only it stared out, but as from some 
great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the 
flicker of a piercing Eye; and then the shadows were furled again and the 
terrible vision was removed. The Eye was not turned to them: it was gazing 
north to where the Captains of the West stood at bay, and thither all its 
malice was now bent, as the Power moved to strike its deadly blow; but Frodo 
at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally. His hand sought the 
chain about his neck. 

Sam knelt by him. Faint, almost inaudibly, he heard Frodo whispering: 
'Help me, Sam! Help me, Sam! Hold my hand! I can't stop it.' Sam took his 
master's hands and laid them together, palm to palm, and kissed them; and 




then he held them gently between his own. The thought came suddenly to him: 
'He's spotted us! It's all up, or it soon will be. Now, Sam Gamgee, this is 
the end of ends.' 

Again he lifted Frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast, 
letting his master's legs dangle. Then he bowed his head and struggled off 
along the climbing road. It was not as easy a way to take as it had looked 
at first. By fortune the fires that had poured forth in the great turmoils 
when Sam stood upon Cirith Ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern 
and 

western slopes, and the road on this side was not blocked. Yet in many 
places it had crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents. After climbing 
eastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp angle and went 
westward fox a space. There at the bend it was cut deep through a crag of 
old weathered stone once long ago vomited from the Mountain's furnaces. 
Panting under his load Sam turned the bend; and even as he did so, out of 
the corner of his eye, he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag, 
like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as he passed. 

A sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward, tearing the backs of 
his hands that still clasped his master's. Then he knew what had happened, 
for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice. 

'Wicked masster!' it hissed. 'Wicked masster cheats us; cheats Smjagol, 
gollum. He musstn't go that way. He musstn'thurt Preciouss. Give it to 
Smjagol, yess, give it to us! Give it to uss!' 

With a violent heave Sam rose up. At once he drew his sword; but he 
could do nothing. Gollum and Frodo were locked together. Gollum was tearing 
at his master, trying to get at the chain and the Ring. This was probably 
the only thing that could have roused the dying embers of Frodo's heart and 
will: an attack, an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force. He 
fought back with a sudden fury that amazed Sam, and Gollum also. Even so 
things might have gone far otherwise, if Gollum himself had remained 
unchanged; but whatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he 
had trodden, driven by a devouring desire and a terrible fear, they had left 
grievous marks on him. He was a lean, starved, haggard thing, all bones and 
tight-drawn sallow skin. A wild light flamed in his eyes, but his malice was 
no longer matched by his old griping strength. Frodo flung him off and rose 
up quivering. 

'Down, down!' he gasped, clutching his hand to his breast, so that 




beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the Ring. 'Down you 
creeping thing, and out of my path! Your time is at an end. You cannot 
betray me or slay me now.' 

Then suddenly, as before under the eaves of the Emyn Muil, Sam saw 
these two rivals with other vision. A crouching shape, scarcely more than 
the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet 
filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable 
now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of 
fire. Out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice. 

'Begone, and trouble me no more! If you touch me ever again, you shall 
be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom.' 

The crouching shape backed away, terror in its blinking eyes, and yet 
at the same time insatiable desire. 

Then the vision passed and Sam saw Frodo standing, hand on breast, his 
breath coming in great gasps, and Gollum at his feet, resting on his knees 
with his wide-splayed hands upon the ground. 

'Fook out!' cried Sam. 'Tie'll spring!' He stepped forward, brandishing 
his sword. 'Quick, Master!' he gasped. 'Go on! Go on! No time to lose. I'll 
deal with him. Go on!' 

Frodo looked at him as if at one now far away. 'Yes, I must go on,' he 
said. 'Farewell, Sam! This is the end at last. On Mount Doom doom shall 
fall. Farewell!' He turned and went on, walking slowly but erect up the 
climbing path. 

'Now!' said Sam. 'At last I can deal with you!' He leaped forward with 
drawn blade ready for battle. But Gollum did not spring. He fell flat upon 
the ground and whimpered. 

'Don't kill us,' he wept. 'Don't hurt us with nassty cruel steel! Fet 
us live, yes, live just a little longer. Fost lost! We're lost. And when 
Precious goes we'll die, yes, die into the dust.' He clawed up the ashes of 
the path with his long fleshless fingers. 'Dusst!' he hissed. 

Sam's hand wavered. His mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil. 
It would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous creature, just and many 
times deserved; and also it seemed the only safe thing to do. But deep in 
his heart there was something that restrained him: he could not strike this 
thing lying in the dust, forlorn, ruinous, utterly wretched. He himself, 
though only for a little while, had borne the Ring, and now dimly he guessed 
the agony of Gollum's shrivelled mind and body, enslaved to that Ring, 




unable to find peace or relief ever in life again. But Sam had no words to 
express what he felt. 

'Oh, curse you, you stinking thing!' he said. ’Go away! Be off! I don't 
trust you, not as far as I could kick you; but be off. Or I shall hurt you, 
yes, with nasty cruel steel.' 

Gollum got up on all fours, and backed away for several paces, and then 
he turned, and as Sam aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path. Sam 
gave no more heed to him. He suddenly remembered his master. He looked 
up 

the path and could not see him. As fast as he could he trudged up the road. 

If he had looked back, he might have seen not far below Gollum turn again, 
and then with a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes come, swiftly but 
warily, creeping on behind, a slinking shadow among the stones. 

The path climbed on. Soon it bent again and. with a last eastward 
course passed in a cutting along the face of the cone and came to the dark 
door in the Mountain's side, the door of the Sammath Naur. Far away now 
rising towards the South the sun, piercing the smokes and haze, burned 
ominous, a dull bleared disc of red; but all Mordor lay about the Mountain 
like a dead land, silent, shadow-folded, waiting for some dreadful stroke. 

Sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in. It was dark and hot, and a 
deep rumbling shook the air. 'Frodo! Master!' he called. There was no 
answer. For a moment he stood, his heart beating with wild fears, and then 
he plunged in. A shadow followed him. 

At first he could see nothing. In his great need he drew out once more 
the phial of Galadriel, but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and 
threw no light into that stifling dark. He was come to the heart of the 
realm of Sauron and the forges of his ancient might, greatest in 
Middle-earth; all other powers were here subdued. Fearfully he took a few 
uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a flash of red 
that leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. Then Sam saw that he was 
in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the Mountain's smoking cone. But 
only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by 
a great fissure, out of which the red glare came, now leaping up, now dying 
down into darkness; and all the while far below there was a rumour and a 
trouble as of great engines throbbing and labouring. 

The light sprang up again, and there on the brink of the chasm, at the 
very Crack of Doom, stood Frodo, black against the glare, tense, erect, but 




still as if he had been turned to stone. 

’Master!' cried Sam. 

Then Frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice, indeed with a voice 
clearer and more powerful than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above 
the throb and turmoil of Mount Doom, ringing in the roof and walls. 

'I have come,' he said. 'But I do not choose now to do what I came to 
do. I will not do this deed. The Ring is mine!' And suddenly, as he set it 
on his finger, he vanished from Sam's sight. Sam gasped, but he had no 
chance to cry out, for at that moment many things happened. 

Something struck Sam violently in the back, his legs were knocked from 
under him and he was flung aside, striking his head against the stony floor, 
as a dark shape sprang over him. He lay still and for a moment all went 
black. 

And far away, as Frodo put on the Ring and claimed it for his own, even 
in Sammath Naur the very heart of his realm, the Power in Barad-dyr was 
shaken, and the Tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter 
crown. The Dark Lord was suddenly aware of him, and his Eye piercing all 
shadows looked across the plain to the door that he had made; and the 
magnitude of his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash, and all 
the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare. Then his wrath blazed in 
consuming flame, but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him. For 
he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung. 

From all his policies and webs of fear and treachery, from all his 
stratagems and wars his mind shook free; and throughout his realm a tremor 
ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, and his captains suddenly 
steerless, bereft of will, wavered and despaired. For they were forgotten. 

The whole mind and purpose of the Power that wielded them was now bent 
with 

overwhelming force upon the Mountain. At his summons, wheeling with a 
rending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the 
Nazgyl the Ring wraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to 
Mount Doom. 

Sam got up. He was dazed, and blood streaming from his head dripped in 
his eyes. He groped forward, and then he saw a strange and terrible thing. 
Gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen 
foe. To and fro he swayed, now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in, 
now dragging back, falling to the ground, rising, and falling again. And all 




the while he hissed but spoke no words. 

The fires below awoke in anger, the red light blazed, and all the 
cavern was filled with a great glare and heat. Suddenly Sam saw Gollum's 
long hands draw upwards to his mouth; his white fangs gleamed, and then 
snapped as they bit. Frodo gave a cry, and there he was, fallen upon his 
knees at the chasm's edge. But Gollum, dancing like a mad thing, held aloft 
the ring, a finger still thrust within its circle. It shone now as if verily 
it was wrought of living fire. 

'Precious, precious, precious!' Gollum cried. 'My Precious! O my 
Precious!' And with that, even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his 
prize, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and 
then with a shriek he fell. Out of the depths came his last wail Precious, 
and he was gone. 

There was a roar and a great confusion of noise. Fires leaped up and 
licked the roof. The throbbing grew to a great tumult, and the Mountain 
shook. Sam ran to Frodo and picked him up and carried him. out to the door. 
And there upon the dark threshold of the Sammath Naur, high above the plains 
of Mordor, such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting 
all else, and gazed as one turned to stone. 

A brief vision he had of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers 
and battlements, tall as hills, founded upon a mighty mountain -throne above 
immeasurable pits; great courts and dungeons, eyeless prisons sheer as 
cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then all passed. Towers 
fell and mountains slid; walls crumbled and melted, crashing down; vast 
spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing up, up, until they 
toppled like an overwhelming wave, and its wild crest curled and came 
foaming down upon the land. And then at last over the miles between there 
came a rumble, rising to a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook, the 
plain heaved and cracked, and Orodruin reeled. Fire belched from its riven 
summit. The skies burst into thunder seared with lightning. Down like 
lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain. And into the heart of the storm, 
with a cry that pierced all other sounds, tearing the clouds asunder, the 
Nazgyl came, shooting like flaming bolts, as caught in the fiery ruin of 
hill and sky they crackled, withered, and went out. 

'Well, this is the end, Sam Gamgee,' said a voice by his side. And 
there was Frodo, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his eyes there 
was peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor any fear. His burden 




was taken away. There was the dear master of the sweet days in the Shire. 

'Master!' cried Sam. and fell upon his knees. In all that ruin of the 
world for the moment he felt only joy, great joy. The burden was gone. His 
master had been saved; he was himself again, he was free. And then Sam 
caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand. 

'Your poor hand!' he said. 'And I have nothing to bind it with, or 
comfort it. I would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather. But he's 
gone now beyond recall, gone for ever.' 

'Yes,' said Frodo. 'But do you remember Gandalf s words: Even Gollum 
may have something yet to do? But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed 
the Ring. The Quest would have been in vain, even at the bitter end. So let 
us forgive him! For the Quest is achieved, and now all is over. I am glad 
you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam.' 




Chapter 4 . The Field of Cormallen 



All about the hills the hosts of Mordor raged. The Captains of the West 
were foundering in a gathering sea. The sun gleamed red, and under the wings 
of the Nazgyl the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth. Aragorn stood 
beneath his banner, silent and stern, as one lost in thought of things long 
past or far away; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as 
the night deepens. Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf, and he was white and 
cold and no shadow fell on him. The onslaught of Mordor broke like a wave on 
the beleaguered hills, voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash 
of arms. 

As if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, Gandalf stirred; 
and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear. Then 
he lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din: The 
Eagles are coming! And many voices answered crying: The Eagles are 
coming! 

The Eagles are coming! The hosts of Mordor looked up and wondered what 
this 

sign might mean. 

There came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of 
all the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor, 
who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the Encircling Mountains 
when Middle-earth was young. Behind them in long swift lines came all their 
vassals from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathering wind. Straight 
down upon the Nazgyl they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and 
the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale. 

But the Nazgyl turned and fled, and vanished into Mordor's shadows, 
hearing a sudden terrible call out of the Dark Tower; and even at that 
moment all the hosts of Mordor trembled, doubt clutched their hearts, their 
laughter failed, their hands shook and their limbs were loosed. The Power 
that drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering, its will 
was removed from them; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they 
saw 

a deadly light and were afraid. 




Then all the Captains of the West cried aloud, for their hearts were 
filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness. Out from the beleaguered 
hills knights of Gondor, Riders of Rohan, D®nedain of the North, 
close-serried companies, drove against their wavering foes, piercing the 
press with the thrust of bitter spears. But Gandalf lifted up his arms and 
called once more in a clear voice: 

’Stand, Men of the West! Stand and wait! This is the hour of doom.’ 

And even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet. Then rising 
swiftly up, far above the Towers of the Black Gate, high above the 
mountains, a vast soaring darkness sprang into the sky, flickering with 
fire. The earth groaned and quaked. The Towers of the Teeth swayed, 
tottered, and fell down; the mighty rampart crumbled; the Black Gate was 
hurled in ruin; and from far away, now dim, now growing, now mounting to 
the 

clouds, there came a drumming rumble, a roar, a long echoing roll of ruinous 
noise. 

'The realm of Sauron is ended!' said Gandalf. 'The Ring -bearer has 
fulfilled his Quest.' And as the Captains gazed south to the Land of Mordor, 
it seemed to them that, black against the pall of cloud, there rose a huge 
shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, filling all the sky. 
Enormous it reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast 
threatening hand, terrible but impotent: for even as it leaned over them, a 
great wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush 
fell. 

The Captains bowed their heads; and when they looked up again, behold! 
their enemies were flying and the power of Mordor was scattering like dust 
in the wind. As when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits 
their crawling hill and holds them all in sway, ants will wander witless and 
purposeless and then feebly die, so the creatures of Sauron, ore or troll or 
beast spell-enslaved, ran hither and thither mindless; and some slew 
themselves, or cast themselves in pits, or fled wailing back to hide in 
holes and dark lightless places far from hope. But the Men of Rhyn and of 
Harad, Easterling and Southron, saw the ruin of their war and the great 
majesty and glory of the Captains of the West. And those that were deepest 
and longest in evil servitude, hating the West, and yet were men proud and 
bold, in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate 
battle. But the most part fled eastward as they could; and some cast their 




weapons down and sued for mercy. 

Then Gandalf, leaving all such matters of battle and command to Aragorn 
and the other lords, stood upon the hill-top and called; and down to him 
came the great eagle, Gwaihir the Windlord, and stood before him. 

'Twice you have borne me, Gwaihir my friend,' said Gandalf. 'Thrice 
shall pay for all, if you are willing. You will not find me a burden much 
greater than when you bore me from Zirak-zigil, where my old life burned 
away.' 

'I would bear you,' answered Gwaihir, 'whither you will, even were you 
made of stone.' 

'Then come, and let your brother go with us, and some other of your 
folk who is most swift! For we have need of speed greater than any wind, 
outmatching the wings of the Nazgyl.' 

'The North Wind blows, but we shall outfly it,' said Gwaihir. And he 
lifted up Gandalf and sped away south, and with him went Landroval, and 
Meneldor young and swift. And they passed over Udyn and Gorgoroth and 
saw 

all the land in ruin and tumult beneath them, and before them Mount Doom 
blazing, pouring out its fire. 

'I am glad that you are here with me,' said Frodo. 'Here at the end of 
all things, Sam.' 

'Yes, I am with you, Master,' said Sam, laying Frodo's wounded hand 
gently to his breast. 'And you're with me. And the journey's finished. But 
after coming all that way I don't want to give up yet. It's not like me, 
somehow, if you understand.' 

'Maybe not, Sam,' said Frodo; 'but it's like things are in the world. 

Hopes fail. An end comes. We have only a little time to wait now. We are 
lost in ruin and downfall, and there is no escape.' 

'Well, Master, we could at least go further from this dangerous place 
here, from this Crack of Doom, if that's its name. Now couldn't we? Come, 
Mr. Frodo, let's go down the path at any rate!' 

'Very well, Sam. If you wish to go, I'll come,' said Frodo; and they 
rose and went slowly down the winding road; and even as they passed towards 
the Mountain's quaking feet, a great smoke and steam belched from the 
Sammath Naur, and the side of the cone was riven open, and a huge fiery 
vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side. 

Frodo and Sam could go no further. Their last strength of mind and body 




was swiftly ebbing. They had reached a low ashen hill piled at the 
Mountain’s foot; but from it there was no more escape. It was an island now, 
not long to endure, amid the torment of Orodruin. All about it the earth 
gaped, and from deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up. Behind them 
the Mountain was convulsed. Great rents opened in its side. Slow rivers of 
fire came down the long slopes towards them. Soon they would be engulfed. A 
rain of hot ash was falling. 

They stood now; and Sam still holding his master's hand caressed it. He 
sighed. ’What a tale we have been in, Mr. Frodo, haven’t we?’ he said. ’I 
wish I could hear it told! Do you think they’ll say: Now comes the story of 
Nine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom? And then everyone will hush, like 
we did, when in Rivendell they told us the tale of Beren One -hand and the 
Great Jewel. I wish I could hear it! And I wonder how it will go on after 
our part.’ 

But even while he spoke so, to keep fear away until the very last, his 
eyes still strayed north, north into the eye of the wind, to where the sky 
far off was clear, as the cold blast, rising to a gale, drove back the 
darkness and the ruin of the clouds. 

And so it was that Gwaihir saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes, as 
down the wild wind he came, and daring the great peril of the skies he 
circled in the air: two small dark figures, forlorn, hand in hand upon a 
little hill, while the world shook under them, and gasped, and rivers of 
fire drew near. And even as he espied them and came swooping down, he 
saw 

them fall, worn out, or choked with fumes and heat, or stricken down by 
despair at last, hiding their eyes from death. 

Side by side they lay; and down swept Gwaihir, and down came Landroval 
and Meneldor the swift; and in a dream, not knowing what fate had befallen 
them, the wanderers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness 
and the fire. 

When Sam awoke, he found that he was lying on some soft bed, but over 
him gently swayed wide beechen boughs, and through their young leaves 
sunlight glimmered, green and gold. All the air was full of a sweet mingled 
scent. 

He remembered that smell: the fragrance of Ithilien. ’Bless me!’ he 
mused. ’How long have I been asleep?’ For the scent had borne him back to 




the day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank; and for a 
moment all else between was out of waking memory. He stretched and drew 
a 

deep breath. ’Why, what a dream I've had!’ he muttered. ’I am glad to wake!’ 
He sat up and then he saw that Frodo was lying beside him, and slept 
peacefully, one hand behind his head, and the other resting upon the 
coverlet. It was the right hand, and the third finger was missing. 

Full memory flooded back, and Sam cried aloud: ’It wasn't a dream! Then 
where are we?' 

And a voice spoke softly behind: 'In the land of Ithilien, and in the 
keeping of the King; and he awaits you.' With that Gandalf stood before him, 
robed in white, his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of 
the leafy sunlight. 'Well, Master Samwise, how do you feel?' he said. 

But Sam lay back, and stared with open mouth, and for a moment, between 
bewilderment and great joy, he could not answer. At last he gasped: 
'Gandalf! I thought you were dead! But then I thought I was dead myself. Is 
everything sad going to come untrue? What's happened to the world?' 

'A great Shadow has departed,' said Gandalf, and then he laughed and 
the sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he 
listened the thought came to Sam that he had not heard laughter, the pure 
sound of merriment, for days upon days without count. It fell upon his ears 
like the echo of all the joys he had ever known. But he himself burst into 
tears. Then, as a sweet rain will pass down a wind of spring and the sun 
will shine out the clearer, his tears ceased, and his laughter welled up, 
and laughing he sprang from his bed. 

'How do I feel?' he cried. 'Well, I don't know how to say it. I feel, I 
feel' - he waved his arms in the air - 'I feel like spring after winter, and 
sun on the leaves; and like trumpets and harps and all the songs I have ever 
heard!' He stopped and he turned towards his master. 'But how's Mr. Frodo?' 
he said. 'Isn't it a shame about his poor hand? But I hope he's all right 
otherwise. He's had a cruel time.' 

'Yes, I am all right otherwise,' said Frodo, sitting up and laughing in 
his turn. I fell asleep again waiting for you, Sam, you sleepyhead. I was 
awake early this morning, and now it must be nearly noon.' 

'Noon?' said Sam, trying to calculate. 'Noon of what day?' 

'The fourteenth of the New Year,' said Gandalf; 'or if you like, the 
eighth day of April in the Shire reckoning. ( But in Gondor the New Year will 




always now begin upon the twenty -fifth of March when Sauron fell, and when 
you were brought out of the fire to the King. He has tended you, and now he 
awaits you. You shall eat and drink with him. When you are ready I will lead 
you to him.’ 

The King?' said Sam. ’What king, and who is he?' 

The King of Gondor and Lord of the Western Lands,' said Gandalf ’and 
he has taken back all his ancient realm. He will ride soon to his crowning, 
but he waits for you.' 

’What shall we wear?' said Sam; for all he could see was the old and 
tattered clothes that they had journeyed in, lying folded on the ground 
beside their beds. 

'The clothes that you wore on your way to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Even 
the ore-rags that you bore in the black land; Frodo, shall be preserved. No 
silks and linens, nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable. But 
later I will find some other clothes, perhaps.' 

Then he held out his hands to them, and they saw that one shone with 
light. 'What have you got there?' Frodo cried. 'Can it be - ?' 

'Yes, I have brought your two treasures. They were found on Sam when 
you were rescued. The Lady Galadriel's gifts: your glass, Frodo, and your 
box, Sam. You will be glad to have these safe again.' 

When they were washed and clad, and had eaten a light meal, the Hobbits 
followed Gandalf. They stepped out of the beech-grove in which they had 
lain, and passed on to a long green lawn, glowing in sunshine, bordered by 
stately dark -leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom. Behind them they could 
hear the sound of falling water, and a stream ran down before them between 
flowering banks, until it came to a greenwood at the lawn's foot and passed 
then on under an archway of trees, through which they saw the shimmer of 
water far away. 

As they came to the opening in the wood, they were surprised to see 
knights in bright mail and tall guards in silver and black standing there, 
who greeted them with honour and bowed before them. And then one blew a 
long 

trumpet, and they went on through the aisle of trees beside the singing 
stream. So they came to a wide green land, and beyond it was a broad river 
in a silver haze, out of which rose a long wooded isle, and many ships lay 
by its shores. But on the field where they now stood a great host was drawn 
up, in ranks and companies glittering in the sun. And as the Hobbits 




approached swords were unsheathed, and spears were shaken, and horns and 
trumpets sang, and men cried with many voices and in many tongues: 

'Long live the Halflings ! Praise them with great praise! 

Cuio i Pheriain anann! Aglar'ni Pheriannath! 

Praise them with great praise, Frodo and Samwise! 

Daur a Berhael, Conin en Annyn! Eglerio! 

Praise them! 

Eglerio! 

A laita te, laita te! Andave laituvalmet! 

Praise them! 

Cormacolindor, a laita tbrienna! 

Praise them! The Ring-bearers, praise them with great praise!' 

And so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining 
with wonder, Frodo and Sam went forward and saw that amidst the 
clamorous 

host were set three high-seats built of green turves. Behind the seat upon 
the right floated, white on green, a great horse running free; upon the left 
was a banner, silver upon blue, a ship swan-prowed faring on the sea; but 
behind the highest throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in 
the breeze, and there a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a 
shining crown and seven glittering stars. On the throne sat a mail-clad man, 
a great sword was laid across his knees, but he wore no helm. As they drew 
near he rose. And then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of 
face, kingly, lord of Men, dark-haired with eyes of grey. 

Frodo ran to meet him, and Sam followed close behind. 'Well, if that 
isn’t the crown of all!' he said. 'Strider, or I'm still asleep!' 

'Yes, Sam, Strider,' said Aragorn. 'It is a long way, is it not, from 
Bree, where you did not like the look of me? A long way for us all but yours 
has been the darkest road.' 

And then to Sam's surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before 
them; and taking them by the hand, Frodo upon his right and Sam upon his 
left, he led them to the throne, and setting them upon it, he turned to the 
men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the 
host, crying: 

'Praise them with great praise!' 

And when the glad shout had swelled up and died away again, to Sam's 
final and complete satisfaction and pure joy, a minstrel of Gondor stood 




forth, and knelt, and begged leave to sing. And behold! he said: 

'Lo! lords and knights and men of valour unashamed, kings and princes, 
and fair people of Gondor, and Riders of Rohan, and ye sons of Elrond, and 
D®nedain of the North, and Elf and Dwarf, and greathearts of the Shire, and 
all free folk of the West, now listen to my lay. For I will sing to you of 
Frodo of the Nine Fingers and the Ring of Doom.' 

And when Sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer delight, and he 
stood up and cried: 'O great glory and splendour! And all my wishes have 
come true!' And then he wept. 

And all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment 
and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all 
men were hushed. And he sang to them, now in the Elven-tongue, now in the 
speech of the West, until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, 
overflowed, and their joy was like swords, and they passed in thought out to 
regions where pain and delight flow together and tears are the very wine of 
blessedness. 

And at the last, as the Sun fell from the noon and the shadows of the 
trees lengthened, he ended. ’Praise them with great praise!' he said and 
knelt. And then Aragorn stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to 
pavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted. 

Frodo and Sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old 
raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen 
was given to them. Then Gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of 
Frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had 
been taken from him in Mordor. For Sam he brought a coat of gilded mail, and 
his elven-cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that it had suffered; and 
then he laid before them two swords. 

'I do not wish for any sword,’ said Frodo. 

'Tonight at least you should wear one,' said Gandalf. 

Then Frodo took the small sword that had belonged to Sam, and had been 
laid at his side in Cirith Ungol. 'Sting I gave to you Sam,' he said. 

'No, master! Mr. Bilbo gave it to you, and it goes with his silver 
coat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.' 

Frodo gave way; and Gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and 
girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver 
upon their heads. And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; 
and they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Jomer of Rohan, and 




the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and 
Legolas. 

But when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came in 
two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in 
the silver and sable of the Guards of Minas Tirith, and the other in white 
and green. But Sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army 
of 

mighty men. Then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, 
he exclaimed: 

'Why, look Mr. Frodo! Look here! Well, if it isn't Pippin. Mr. Peregrin 
Took I should say, and Mr. Merry! How they have grown! Bless me! But I 
can 

see there's more tales to tell than ours.' 

'There are indeed,' said Pippin turning towards him. 'And we'll begin 
telling them, as soon as this feast is ended. In the meantime you can try 
Gandalf. He's not so close as he used to be, though he laughs now more than 
he talks. For the present Merry and I are busy. We are knights of the City 
and of the Mark, as I hope you observe.' 

At last the glad day ended; and when the Sun was gone and the round 
Moon rode slowly above the mists of Anduin and flickered through the 
fluttering leaves, Frodo and Sam sat under the whispering trees amid the 
fragrance of fair Ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with Merry 
and Pippin and Gandalf, and after a while Legolas and Gimli joined them. 
There Frodo and Sam learned much of all that had happened to the Company 
after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at Parth Galen by Rauros 
Falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell. 

Ores, and talking trees, and leagues of grass, and galloping riders, 
and glittering caves, and white towers and golden halls, and battles, and 
tall ships sailing, all these passed before Sam's mind until he felt 
bewildered. But amidst all these wonders he returned always to his 
astonishment at the size of Merry and Pippin; and he made them stand back to 
back with Frodo and himself. He scratched his head. 'Can't understand it at 
your age!' he said. 'But there it is: you're three inches taller than you 
ought to he, or I'm a dwarf.' 

'That you certainly are not,' said Gimli. 'But what did I say? Mortals 
cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a 
pot of beer.' 




’Ent-draughts?' said Sam. 'There you go about Ents again; but what they 
are beats me. Why, it will take weeks before we get all these things sized 
up!' 

'Weeks indeed,' said Pippin. 'And then Frodo will have to be locked up 
in a tower in Minas Tirith and write it all down. Otherwise he will forget 
half of it, and poor old Bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed.' 

At length Gandalf rose. 'The hands of the King are hands of healing, 
dear friends,' he said. 'But you went to the very brink of death ere he 
recalled you, putting forth all his power, and sent you into the sweet 
forgetfulness of sleep. And though you have indeed slept long and blessedly, 
still it is now time to sleep again.' 

And not only Sam and Frodo here, said Gimli, but you too, Pippin. I 
love you, if only because of the pains you have cost me, which I shall never 
forget. Nor shall I forget finding you on the hill of the last battle. But 
for Gimli the Dwarf you would have been lost then. But at least I know now 
the look of a hobbit's foot, though it be all that can be seen under a heap 
of bodies. And when I heaved that great carcase off you, I made sure you 
were dead. I could have, torn out my beard. And it is only a day yet since 
you were first up and abroad again. To bed now you go. And so shall I.' 

'And I,' said Legolas, 'shall walk in the woods of this fair land, 
which is rest enough. In days to come, if my Elven-lord allows, some of our 
folk shall remove hither; and when we come it shall be blessed, for a while. 
For a while: a month, a life, a hundred years of Men. But Anduin is near, 
and Anduin leads down to the Sea. To the Sea! 

To the Sea, to the Sea! The white gulls are crying, 

The wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying. 

West, west away, the round sun is falling. 

Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling. 

The voices of my people that have gone before me? 

I will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me; 

For our days are ending and our years failing. 

I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing. 

Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling, 

Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling, 

In Eressla, in Elvenhome that no man can discover, 

Where the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!' 

And so singing Fegolas went away down the hill. 




Then the others also departed, and Frodo and Sam went to their beds and 
slept. And in the morning they rose again in hope and peace; and they spent 
many days in Ithilien. For the Field of Cormallen, where the host was now 
encamped was near to Henneth Annyn, and the stream that flowed from its 
falls could be heard in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate, 
and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of Anduin by the Isle of 
Cair Andros. The hobbits wandered here and there visiting again the places 
that they had passed before; and Sam hoped always in some shadow of the 
woods or secret glade to catch, maybe, a glimpse of the great Oliphaunt. And 
when he learned that at the siege of Gondor there had been a great number of 
these beasts but that they were all destroyed, he thought it a sad loss. 

'Well, one can't be everywhere at once, I suppose,' he said. 'But I 
missed a lot, seemingly.' 

In the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to Minas Tirith. 

The weary rested and the hurt were healed. For some had laboured and fought 
much with the remnants of the Easterlings and Southrons, until all were 
subdued. And, latest of all, those returned who had passed into Mordor and 
destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land. 

But at the last when the month of May was drawing near the Captains of 
the West set out again; and they went aboard ship with all their men, and 
they sailed from Cair Andros down Anduin to Osgiliath; and there they 
remained for one day; and the day after they came to the green fields of the 
Pelennor and saw again the white towers under tall Mindolluin, the City of 
the Men of Gondor, last memory of Westernesse, that had passed through the 
darkness and fire to a new day. 

And there in the midst of the fields they set up their pavilions and 
awaited the morning; for it was the Eve of May, and the King would enter his 
gates with the rising of the Sun. 




Chapter 5 . The Steward and the King 



Over the city of Gondor doubt and great dread had hung. Fair weather 
and clear sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days held little hope, 
and who looked each morning for news of doom. Their lord was dead and 
burned, dead lay the King of Rohan in their citadel, and the new king that 
had come to them in the night was gone again to a war with powers too dark 
and terrible for any might or valour to conquer. And no news came. After the 
host left Morgul Vale and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the 
mountains no messenger had returned nor any rumour of what was passing in 
the brooding East. 

When the Captains were but two days gone, the Lady Jowyn bade the 
women 

who tended her to bring her raiment, and she would not be gainsaid, but 
rose; and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen, she 
went to the Warden of the Houses of Healing. 

’Sir,’ she said, 'I am in great unrest, and I cannot lie longer in 
sloth.' 

'Lady,' he answered, ’you are not yet healed, and I was commanded to 
tend you with especial care. You should not have risen from your bed for 
seven days yet, or so I was bidden. I beg you to go back.' 

'I am healed,' she said, 'healed at least in body, save my left arm 
only, and that is at ease. But I shall sicken anew, if there is naught that 
I can do. Are there no tidings of war? The women can tell me nothing.' 

'There are no tidings,' said the Warden, 'save that the Lords have 
ridden to Morgul Vale; and men say that the new captain out of the North is 
their chief. A great lord is that, and a healer; and it is a thing passing 
strange to me that the healing hand should also wield the sword. It is not 
thus in Gondor now, though once it was so, if old tales be true. But for 
long years we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of 
swords. Though we should still have enough to do without them: the world is 
full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them.' 

It needs but one foe to breed a war, not two, Master Warden, answered 
Jowyn. 'And those who have not swords can still die upon them. Would you 
have the folk of Gondor gather you herbs only, when the Dark Lord gathers 




armies? And it is not always good to be healed in body. Nor is it always 
evil to die in battle, even in bitter pain. Were I permitted, in this dark 
hour I would choose the latter.' 

The Warden looked at her. Tall she stood there, her eyes bright in her 
white face, her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out of his window that 
opened to the East. He sighed and shook his head. After a pause she turned 
to him again. 

'Is there no deed to do?' she said. 'Who commands in this City?' 

'I do not rightly know,' he answered. 'Such things are not my care. 

There is a marshal over the Riders of Rohan; and the Lord H®rin, I am told, 
commands the men of Gondor. But the Lord Laramir is by right the Steward of 
the City.' 

'Where can I find him?' 

'In this house, lady. He was sorely hurt, but is now set again on the 
way to health. But I do not know—' 

'Will you not bring me to him? Then you will know.' 

The Lord Laramir was walking alone in the garden of the Houses of 
Healing, and the sunlight warmed him, and he felt life run new in his veins; 
but his heart was heavy, and he looked out over the walls eastward. And 
coming, the Warden spoke his name, and he turned and saw the Lady Jowyn 
of 

Rohan; and he was moved with pity, for he saw that she was hurt, and his 
clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest. 

'My lord,' said the Warden, 'here is the Lady Jowyn of Rohan. She rode 
with the king and was sorely hurt, and dwells now in my keeping. But she is 
not content, and she wishes to speak to the Steward of the City.' 

'Do not misunderstand him, lord,' said Jowyn. 'It is not lack of care 
that grieves me. No houses could be fairer, for those who desire to be 
healed. But I cannot lie in sloth, idle, caged. I looked for death in 
battle. But I have not died, and battle still goes on.' 

At a sign from Laramir, the Warden bowed and departed. 'What would you 
have me do, lady?' said Laramir. 'I also am a prisoner of the healers.' He 
looked at her, and being a man whom pity deeply stirred, it seemed to him 
that her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart. And she looked at 
him and saw the grave tenderness in his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred 
among men of war, that here was one whom no Rider of the Mark would 
outmatch 




in battle. 

’What do you wish?' he said again. 'If it lies in my power, I will do 
it.' 

'I would have you command this Warden, and bid him let me go,' she 
said; but though her words were still proud, her heart faltered, and for the 
first time she doubted herself. She guessed that this tall man, both stern 
and gentle, might think her merely wayward, like a child that has not the 
firmness of mind to go on with a dull task to the end. 

'I myself am in the Warden's keeping,' answered Faramir. 'Nor have I 
yet taken up my authority in the City. But had I done so, I should still 
listen to his counsel, and should not cross his will in matters of his 
craft, unless in some great need.' 

'But I do not desire healing,' she said. 'I wish to ride to war like my 
brother Jomer, or better like Thjoden the king, for he died and has both 
honour and peace.' 

'It is too late, lady, to follow the Captains, even if you had the 
strength,' said Faramir. 'But death in battle may come to us all yet, 
willing or unwilling. You will be better prepared to face it in your own 
manner, if while there is still time you do as the Healer commanded. You and 
I, we must endure with patience the hours of waiting.' 

She did not answer, but as he looked at her it seemed to him that 
something in her softened, as though a bitter frost were yielding at the 
first faint presage of Spring. A tear sprang in her eye and fell down her 
cheek, like a glistening rain-drop. Her proud head drooped a little. Then 
quietly, more as if speaking to herself than to him: 'But the healers would 
have me lie abed seven days yet,' she said. 'And my window does not look 
eastward.' Her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad. 

Faramir smiled, though his heart was filled with pity. 'Your window 
does not look eastward?' he said. 'That can be amended. In this I will 
command the Warden. If you will stay in this house in our care, lady, and 
take your rest, then you shall walk in this garden in the sun, as you will; 
and you shall look east, whither all our hopes have gone. And here you will 
find me, walking and waiting, and also looking east. It would ease my care, 
if you would speak to me, or walk at whiles with me.' 

Then she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again; and a colour 
came in her pale face. 'How should I ease your care, my lord?' she said. 
'And I do not desire the speech of living men.' 




'Would you have my plain answer?' he said. 

'I would.' 

'Then, Jowyn of Rohan, I say to you that you are beautiful. In the 
valleys of our hills there are flowers fair and bright, and maidens fairer 
still; but neither flower nor lady have I seen till now in Gondor so lovely, 
and so sorrowful. It may be that only a few days are left ere darkness falls 
upon our world, and when it comes I hope to face it steadily; but it would 
ease my heart, if while the Sun yet shines, I could see you still. For you 
and I have both passed under the wings of the Shadow, and the same hand drew 
us back.' 

'Alas, not me, lord!' she said. 'Shadow lies on me still. Look not to 
me for healing! I am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungentle. But I thank you 
for this at least, that I need not keep to my chamber. I will walk abroad by 
the grace of the Steward of the City.' And she did him a courtesy and walked 
back to the house. But Faramir for a long while walked alone in the garden, 
and his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls. 

When he returned to his chamber he called for the Warden, and heard all 
that he could tell of the Lady of Rohan. 

'But I doubt not, lord,' said the Warden, 'that you would learn more 
from the Halfling that is with us; for he was in the riding of the king, and 
with the Lady at the end, they say.' 

And so Merry was sent to Faramir, and while that day lasted they talked 
long together, and Faramir learned much, more even than Merry put into 
words; and he thought that he understood now something of the grief and 
unrest of Jowyn of Rohan. And in the fair evening Faramir and Merry walked 
in the garden, but she did not come. 

But in the morning, as Faramir came from the Houses, he saw her, as she 
stood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and gleamed in the sun. 

And he called to her, and she came down, and they walked on the grass or sat 
under a green tree together, now in silence, now in speech. And each day 
after they did likewise. And the Warden looking from his window was glad in 
heart, for he was a healer, and his care was lightened; and certain it was 
that, heavy as was the dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of 
men, still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength. 

And so the fifth day came since the Lady Jowyn went first to Faramir; 
and they stood now together once more upon the walls of the City and looked 
out. No tidings had yet come, and all hearts were darkened. The weather, 




too, was bright no longer. It was cold. A wind that had sprung up in the 
night was blowing now keenly from the North, and it was rising; but the 
lands about looked grey and drear. 

They were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks, and over all the Lady 
Jowyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer -night, and it 
was set with silver stars about hem and throat. Faramir had sent for this 
robe and had wrapped it about her; and he thought that she looked fair and 
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side. The mantle was wrought for 
his mother, Finduilas of Amroth, who died untimely, and was to him but a 
memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief; and her robe seemed 
to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of Jowyn. 

But she now shivered beneath the starry mantle, and she looked 
northward, above the grey hither lands, into the eye of the cold wind where 
far away the sky was hard and clear. 

’What do you look for, Jowyn?' said Faramir. 

'Does not the Black Gate lie yonder?' said she. 'And must he not now be 
come thither? It is seven days since he rode away.' 

'Seven days,' said Faramir. 'But think not ill of me, if I say to you: 
they have brought me both a joy and a pain that I never thought to know. Joy 
to see you; but pain, because now the fear and doubt of this evil time are 
grown dark indeed. Jowyn, I would not have this world end now, or lose so 
soon what I have found.' 

'Lose what you have found, lord?' she answered; but she looked at him 
gravely and her eyes were kind. 'I know not what in these days you have 
found that you could lose. But come, my friend, let us not speak of it! Let 
us not speak at all! I stand upon some dreadful brink, and it is utterly 
dark in the abyss before my feet, but whether there is any light behind me I 
cannot tell. For I cannot turn yet. I wait for some stroke of doom.' 

'Yes, we wait for the stroke of doom,' said Faramir. And they said no 
more; and it seemed to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind died, 
and the light failed, and the Sun was bleared, and all sounds in the City or 
in the lands about were hushed: neither wind, nor voice, nor bird-call, nor 
rustle of leaf, nor their own breath could be heard; the very beating of 
their hearts was stilled. Time halted. 

And as they stood so, their hands met and clasped, though they did not 
know it. And still they waited for they knew not what. Then presently it 
seemed to them that above the ridges of the distant mountains another vast 




mountain of darkness rose, towering up like a wave that should engulf the 
world, and about it lightnings flickered; and then a tremor ran through the 
earth, and they felt the walls of the City quiver. A sound like a sigh went 
up from all the lands about them; and their hearts beat suddenly again. 

'It reminds me of N®menor,' said Faramir, and wondered to hear himself 
speak. 

'Of N®menor?' said Jowyn. 

'Yes,' said Faramir, 'of the land of Westernesse that foundered and of 
the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills, and 
coming on, darkness unescapable. I often dream of it.' 

'Then you think that the Darkness is coming?' said Jowyn. 'Darkness 
Unescapable?' And suddenly she drew close to him. 

'No,' said Faramir, looking into her face. 'It was but a picture in the 
mind. I do not know what is happening. The reason of my waking mind tells 
me 

that great evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days. But my heart 
says nay; and all my limbs are light, and a hope and joy are come to me that 
no reason can deny. Jowyn, Jowyn, White Lady of Rohan, in this hour I do not 
believe that any darkness will endure!' And he stooped and kissed her brow. 

And so they stood on the walls of the City of Gondor, and a great wind 
rose and blew, and their hair, raven and golden, streamed out mingling in 
the air. And the Shadow departed, and the Sun was unveiled, and light leaped 
forth; and the waters of Anduin shone like silver, and in all the houses of 
the City men sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts from what 
source they could not tell. 

And before the Sun had fallen far from the noon out of the East there 
came a great Eagle flying, and he bore tidings beyond hope from the Lords of 
the West, crying: 

Sing now, ye people of the Tower of Anor, 
for the Realm of Sauron is ended for ever, 
and the Dark Tower is thrown down. 

Sing and rejoice, ye people of the Tower of Guard, 

for your watch hath not been in vain, 

and the Black Gate is broken, 

and your King hath passed through, 

and he is victorious. 




Sing and be glad, all ye children of the West, 
for your King shall come again, 
and he shall dwell among you 
all the days of your life. 

And the Tree that was withered shall be renewed, 
and he shall plant it in the high places, 
and the City shall be blessed. 

Sing all ye people! 

And the people sang in all the ways of the City. 

The days that followed were golden, and Spring and Summer joined and 
made revel together in the fields of Gondor. And tidings now came by swift 
riders from Cair Andros of all that was done, and the City made ready for 
the coming of the King. Merry was summoned and rode away with the wains 
that 

took store of goods to Osgiliath and thence by ship to Cair Andros; but 
Faramir did not go, for now being healed he took upon him his authority and 
the Stewardship, although it was only for a little while, and his duty was 
to prepare for one who should replace him. 

And Jowyn did not go, though her brother sent word begging her to come 
to the field of Cormallen. And Faramir wondered at this, but he saw her 
seldom, being busy with many matters; and she dwelt still in the Flouses of 
Flealing and walked alone in the garden, and her face grew pale again, and it 
seemed that in all the City she only was ailing and sorrowful. And the 
Warden of the Houses was troubled, and he spoke to Faramir. 

Then Faramir came and sought her, and once more they stood on the walls 
together; and he said to her: 'Jowyn, why do you tarry here, and do not go 
to the rejoicing in Cormallen beyond Cair Andros, where your brother awaits 
you?' 

And she said: 'Do you not know?' 

But he answered: 'Two reasons there may be, but which is true, 1 do not 
know.' 

And she said: 'I do not wish to play at riddles. Speak plainer!' 

'Then if you will have it so, lady,' he said: 'you do not go, because 
only your brother called for you, and to look on the Lord Aragorn, Elendil's 




heir, in his triumph would now bring you no joy. Or because I do not go, and 
you desire still to be near me. And maybe for both these reasons, and you 
yourself cannot choose between them. Jowyn, do you not love me, or will you 
not?' 

'I wished to be loved by another,' she answered. 'But I desire no man's 
pity.' 

'That I know,' he said. 'You desired to have the love of the Lord 
Aragorn. Because he was high and puissant, and you wished to have renown 
and 

glory and to be lifted far above the mean things that crawl on the earth. 

And as a great captain may to a young soldier he seemed to you admirable. 
For so he is, a lord among men, the greatest that now is. But when he gave 
you only understanding and pity, then you desired to have nothing, unless a 
brave death in battle. Look at me, Jowyn!' 

And Jowyn looked at Faramir long and steadily; and Faramir said: 'Do 
not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, Jowyn! But I do not offer 
you my pity. For you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won 
renown that shall not be forgotten; and you are a lady beautiful, I deem, 
beyond even the words of the Elven-tongue to tell. And I love you. Once I 
pitied your sorrow. But now, were you sorrowless, without fear or any lack, 
were you the blissful Queen of Gondor, still I would love you. Jowyn, do you 
not love me?' 

Then the heart of Jowyn changed, or else at last she understood it. And 
suddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her. 

I stand in Minas Anor, the Tower of the Sun, she said; and behold the 
Shadow has departed! I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the 
great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, 
and love all things that grow and are not barren.' And again she looked at 
Faramir. 'No longer do I desire to be a queen,' she said. 

Then Faramir laughed merrily. 'That is well,' he said; 'for I am not a 
king. Yet I will wed with the White Lady of Rohan, if it be her will. And if 
she will, then let us cross the River and in happier days let us dwell in 
fair Ithilien and there make a garden. All things will grow with joy there, 
if the White Lady comes.' 

'Then must I leave my own people, man of Gondor?' she said. 'And would 
you have your proud folk say of you: (There goes a lord who tamed a wild 
shieldmaiden of the North! Was there no woman of the race ofN®menor to 




choose?(' 

'I would,' said Faramir. And he took her in his arms and kissed her 
under the sunlit sky, and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls 
in the sight of many. And many indeed saw them and the light that shone 
about them as they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the 
Houses of Healing. 

And to the Warden of the Houses Faramir said: 'Here is the Lady Jowyn 
of Rohan, and now she is healed.' 

And the Warden said: 'Then I release her from my charge and bid her 
farewell, and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again. I commend her to 
the care of the Steward of the City, until her brother returns.' 

But Jowyn said: 'Yet now that I have leave to depart, I would remain. 

For this House has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed.' And she 
remained there until King Jomer came. 

All things were now made ready in the City; and there was great 
concourse of people, for the tidings had gone out into all parts of Gondor, 
from Min-Rimmon even to Pinnath Gelin and the far coasts of the sea; and all 
that could come to the City made haste to come. And the City was filled 
again with women and fair children that returned to their homes laden with 
flowers; and from Dol Amroth came the harpers that harped most skilfully in 
all the land; and there were players upon viols and upon flutes and upon 
horns of silver, and clear-voiced singers from the vales of Lebennin. 

At last an evening came when from the walls the pavilions could be seen 
upon the field, and all night lights were burning as men watched for the 
dawn. And when the sun rose in the clear morning above the mountains in the 
East, upon which shadows lay no more, then all the bells rang, and all the 
banners broke and flowed in the wind; and upon the White Tower of the 
citadel the standard of the Stewards, bright argent like snow in the sun, 
bearing no charge nor device, was raised over Gondor for the last time. 

Now the Captains of the West led their host towards the City, and folk 
saw them advance in line upon line, flashing and glinting in the sunrise and 
rippling like silver. And so they came before the Gateway and halted a 
furlong from the walls. As yet no gates had been set up again, but a barrier 
was laid across the entrance to the City, and there stood men at arms in 
silver and black with long swords drawn. Before the barrier stood Faramir 
the Steward, and H®rin Warden of the Keys, and other captains of Gondor, and 
the Lady Jowyn of Rohan with Elfhelm the Marshal and many knights of the 




Mark; and upon either side of the Gate was a great press of fair people in 
raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers. 

So now there was a wide space before the walls of Minas Tirith, and it 
was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the soldiers of Gondor and 
of Rohan, and by the people of the City and of all parts of the land. A hush 
fell upon all as out from the host stepped the D®nedain in silver and grey; 
and before them came walking slow the Lord Aragorn. He was clad in black 
mail girt with silver, and he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at 
the throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar; but his head 
was bare save for a star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of 
silver. With him were Jomer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil, and Gandalf 
robed all in white, and four small figures that many men marvelled to see. 

'Nay, cousin! they are not boys,' said Ioreth to her kinswoman from 
Imloth Melui, who stood beside her. 'Those are Periain, out of the far 
country of the Halflings, where they are princes of great fame, it is said. 

I should know, for I had one to tend in the Houses. They are small, but they 
are valiant. Why, cousin, one of them went with only his esquire into the 
Black Country and fought with the Dark Lord all by himself, and set fire to 
his Tower, if you can believe it. At least that is the tale in the City. 

That will be the one that walks with our Elf stone. They are dear friends, I 
hear. Now he is a marvel, the Lord Elfstone: not too soft in his speech, 
mind you, but he has a golden heart, as the saying is; and he has the 
healing hands. (The hands of the king are the hands of a healer(, I said; 
and that was how it was all discovered. And Mithrandir, he said to me: 
(Ioreth, men will long remember your words(, and—' 

But Ioreth was not permitted to continue the instruction of her 
kinswoman from the country, for a single trumpet rang, and a dead silence 
followed. Then forth from the Gate went Faramir with H®rin of the Keys, and 
no others, save that behind them walked four men in the high helms and 
armour of the Citadel, and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound 
with silver. 

Faramir met Aragorn in the midst of those there assembled, and he 
knelt, and said: 'The last Steward of Gondor begs leave to surrender his 
office.' And he held out a white rod; but Aragorn took the rod and gave it 
back, saying: 'That office is not ended, and it shall be thine and thy 
heirs' as long as my line shall last. Do now thy office!' 

Then Faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice: 'Men of Gondor hear 




now the Steward of this Realm! Behold! one has come to claim the kingship 
again at last. Here is Aragorn son of Arathorn, chieftain of the D®nedain of 
Arnor, Captain of the Host of the West, bearer of the Star of the North, 
wielder of the Sword Reforged, victorious in battle, whose hands bring 
healing, the Elf stone, Elessar of the line of Valandil, Isildur's son, 

Elendil's son of N®menor. Shall he be king and enter into the City and dwell 
there?' 

And all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice. 

And Ioreth said to her kinswoman: 'This is just a ceremony such as we 
have in the City, cousin; for he has already entered, as I was telling you; 
and he said to me—' And then again she was obliged to silence, for Faramir 
spoke again. 

'Men of Gondor, the loremasters tell that it was the custom of old that 
the king should receive the crown from his father ere he died; or if that 
might not be, that he should go alone and take it from the hands of his 
father in the tomb where he was laid. But since things must now be done 
otherwise, using the authority of the Steward, I have today brought hither 
from Rath Dnnen the crown of Edrnur the last king, whose days passed in the 
time of our longfathers of old.' 

Then the guards stepped forward, and Faramir opened the casket, and he 
held up an ancient crown. It was shaped like the helms of the Guards of the 
Citadel, save that it was loftier, and it was all white, and the wings at 
either side were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of 
a sea-bird, for it was the emblem of kings who came over the Sea; and seven 
gems of adamant were set in the circlet, and upon its summit was set a 
single jewel the light of which went up like a flame. 

Then Aragorn took the crown and held it up and said: 

Et Edrello Endorenna ut®lien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' 
Ambar-metta! 

And those were the words that Elendil spoke when he came up out of the 
Sea on the wings of the wind: 'Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am 
come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the 
world.' 

Then to the wonder of many Aragorn did not put the crown upon his head, 
but gave it back to Faramir, and said: 'By the labour and valour of many I 
have come into my inheritance. In token of this I would have the Ring -bearer 
bring the crown to me, and let Mithrandir set it upon my head, if he will; 




for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his 
victory.' 

Then Frodo came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore it to 
Gandalf; and Aragorn knelt, and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head, 
and said: 

’Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the 
thrones of the Valar endure!’ 

But when Aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence, for it 
seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time. Tall as 
the sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of days he 
seemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and 
strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was about him. And then 
Faramir cried: 

’Behold the King!’ 

And in that moment all the trumpets were blown, and the King Elessar 
went forth and came to the barrier, and H®rin of the Keys thrust it back; 
and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear 
voices the King passed through the flower -laden streets, and came to the 
Citadel, and entered in; and the banner of the Tree and the Stars was 
unfurled upon the topmost tower, and the reign of King Elessar began, of 
which many songs have told. 

In his time the City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in 
the days of its first glory; and it was filled with trees and with 
fountains, and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel, and its streets 
were paved with white marble; and the Folk of the Mountain laboured in it, 
and the Folk of the Wood rejoiced to come there; and all was healed and made 
good, and the houses were filled with men and women and the laughter of 
children, and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty; and after the 
ending of the Third Age of the world into the new age it preserved the 
memory and the glory of the years that were gone. 

In the days that followed his crowning the King sat on his throne in 
the Hall of the Kings and pronounced his judgements. And embassies came 
from 

many lands and peoples, from the East and the South, and from the borders of 
Mirkwood, and from Dunland in the west. And the King pardoned the 
Easterlings that had given themselves up, and sent them away free, and he 
made peace with the peoples of Harad; and the slaves of Mordor he released 




and gave to them all the lands about Lake N®rnen to be their own. And there 
were brought before him many to receive his praise and reward for their 
valour; and last the captain of the Guard brought to him Beregond to be 
judged. 

And the King said to Beregond: 'Beregond, by your sword blood was 
spilled in the Hallows, where that is forbidden. Also you left your post 
without leave of Lord or of Captain. For these things, of old, death was the 
penalty. Now therefore I must pronounce your doom. 

'All penalty is remitted for your valour in battle, and still more 
because all that you did was for the love of the Lord Faramir. Nonetheless 
you must leave the Guard of the Citadel, and you must go forth from the City 
of Minas Tirith.' 

Then the blood left Beregond's face, and he was stricken to the heart 
and bowed his head. But the King said.: 

'So it must be, for you are appointed to the White Company, the Guard 
of Faramir, Prince of Ithilien, and you shall be its captain and dwell in 
Emyn Arnen in honour and peace, and in the service of him for whom you 
risked all, to save him from death.' 

And then Beregond, perceiving the mercy and justice of the King, was 
glad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and content. And 
Aragorn gave to Faramir Ithilien to be his princedom, and bade him dwell in 
the hills of Emyn Arnen within sight of the City. 

'For,' said he, 'Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, 
and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for 
many long years.' 

And last of all Aragorn greeted Jomer of Rohan, and they embraced, and 
Aragorn said: 'Between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of 
reward; for we are brethren. In happy hour did Eorl ride from the North, and 
never has any league of peoples been more blessed, so that neither has ever 
failed the other, nor shall fail. Now, as you know, we have laid Thjoden the 
Renowned in a tomb in the Hallows, and there he shall lie for ever among the 
Kings of Gondor, if you will. Or if you desire it, we will come to Rohan and 
bring him back to rest with his own people.' 

And Jomer answered: 'Since the day when you rose before me out of the 
green grass of the downs I have loved you, and that love shall not fail. But 
now I must depart for a while to my own realm, where there is much to heal 
and set in order. But as for the Fallen, when all is made ready we will 




return for him; but here let him sleep a while.' 

And Jowyn said to Faramir: 'Now I must go back to my own land and look 
on it once again, and help my brother in his labour; but when one whom I 
long loved as father is laid at last to rest, I will return.' 

So the glad days passed; and on the eighth day of May the Riders of 
Rohan made ready, and rode off by the North-way, and with them went the 
sons 

of Elrond. All the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise 
them, from the Gate of the City to the walls of the Pelennor. Then all 
others that dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing; but in the City 
there was labour of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove 
all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness. 

The hobbits still remained in Minas Tirith, with Legolas and Gimli; for 
Aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved. 'At last all such 
things must end,' he said, 'but I would have you wait a little while longer: 
for the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come. A day 
draws near that I have looked for in all the years of my manhood, and when 
it comes I would have my friends beside me.' But of that day he would say no 
more. 

In those days the Companions of the Ring dwelt together in a fair house 
with Gandalf, and they went to and fro as they wished. And Frodo said to 
Gandalf: 'Do you know what this day is that Aragorn speaks of? For we are 
happy here, and I don't wish to go; but the days are running away, and Bilbo 
is waiting; and the Shire is my home.' 

'As for Bilbo,' said Gandalf, 'he is waiting for the same day, and he 
knows what keeps you. And as for the passing of the days, it is now only May 
and high summer is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if 
an age of the world had gone by, yet to the trees and the grass it is less 
than a year since you set out.' 

'Pippin,' said Frodo, 'didn't you say that Gandalf was less close than 
of old? Fie was weary of his labours then, I think. Now he is recovering.' 

And Gandalf said: 'Many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set 
on the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep 
their secret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder. And Aragorn 
himself waits for a sign.' 

There came a day when Gandalf could not be found, and the Companions 




wondered what was going forward. But Gandalf took Aragorn out from the 
City 

by night, and he brought him to the southern feet of Mount Mindolluin; and 
there they found a path made in ages past that few now dared to tread. For 
it led up on to the mountain to a high hallow where only the kings had been 
wont to go. And they went up by steep ways, until they came to a high field 
below the snows that clad the lofty peaks, and it looked down over the 
precipice that stood behind the City. And standing there they surveyed the 
lands, for the morning was come; and they saw the towers of the City far 
below them like white pencils touched by the sunlight, and all the Vale of 
Anduin was like a garden, and the Mountains of Shadow were veiled in a 
golden mist. Upon the one side their sight reached to the grey Emyn Muil, 
and the glint of Rauros was like a star twinkling far off; and upon the 
other side they saw the River like a ribbon laid down to Pelargir, and 
beyond that was a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the Sea. 

And Gandalf said: This is your realm, and the heart of the greater 
realm that shall be. The Third Age of the world is ended, and the new age is 
begun; and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what may 
be preserved. For though much has been saved, much must now pass away; 
and 

the power of the Three Rings also is ended. And all the lands that you see, 
and those that lie round about them, shall be dwellings of Men. For the time 
comes of the Dominion of Men, and the Elder Kindred shall fade or depart.' 

'I know it well, dear friend,' said Aragorn; 'but I would still have 
your counsel.' 

'Not for long now,' said Gandalf. 'The Third Age was my age. I was the 
Enemy of Sauron; and my work is finished. I shall go soon. The burden must 
lie now upon you and your kindred.' 

'But I shall die,' said Aragorn. 'For I am a mortal man, and though 
being what I am and of the race of the West unmingled, I shall have life far 
longer than other men, yet that is but a little while; and when those who 
are now in the wombs of women are born and have grown old, I too shall grow 
old. And who then shall govern Gondor and those who look to this City as to 
their queen, if my desire be not granted? The Tree in the Court of the 
Fountain is still withered and barren. When shall I see a sign that it will 
ever be otherwise?' 

'Turn your face from the green world, and look where all seems barren 




and cold!' said Gandalf. 

Then Aragorn turned, and there was a stony slope behind him running 
down from the skirts of the snow; and as he looked he was aware that alone 
there in the waste a growing thing stood. And he climbed to it, and saw that 
out of the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no more than 
three foot high. Already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely, 
dark above and silver beneath, and upon its slender crown it bore one small 
cluster of flowers whose white petals shone like the sunlit snow. 

Then Aragorn cried: 'Yj! ut®vienyes! I have found it! Lo! here is a 
scion of the Eldest of Trees! But how comes it here? For it is not itself 
yet seven years old.’ 

And Gandalf coming looked at it, and said: 'Verily this is a sapling of 
the line of Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling of Galathilion, and 
that a fruit of Telperion of many names, Eldest of Trees. Who shall say how 
it comes here in the appointed hour? But this is an ancient hallow, and ere 
the kings failed or the Tree withered in the court, a fruit must have been 
set here. For it is said that, though the fruit of the Tree comes seldom to 
ripeness, yet the life within may then lie sleeping through many long years, 
and none can foretell the time in which it will awake. Remember this. For if 
ever a fruit ripens, it should be planted, lest the line die out of the 
world. Flere it has lain, hidden on the mountain, even as the race of Elendil 
lay hidden in the wastes of the North. Yet the line of Nimloth is older far 
than your line, King Elessar.' 

Then Aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling, and lo! it seemed to 
hold only lightly to the earth, and it was removed without hurt; and Aragorn 
bore it back to the Citadel. Then the withered tree was uprooted, but with 
reverence; and they did not burn it, but laid it to rest in the silence of 
Rath Dnnen. And Aragorn planted the new tree in the court by the fountain, 
and swiftly and gladly it began to grow; and when the month of June entered 
in it was laden with blossom. 

'The sign has been given,' said Aragorn, 'and the day is not far off.' 

And he set watchmen upon the walls. 

It was the day before Midsummer when messengers came from Amon D(n 
to 

the City, and they said that there was a riding of fair folk out of the 
North, and they drew near now to the walls of the Pelennor. And the King 
said: 'At last they have come. Fet all the City be made ready!' 




Upon the very Eve of Midsummer, when the sky was blue as sapphire and 
white stars opened in the East, but the West was still golden and the air 
was cool and fragrant, the riders came down the North-way to the gates of 
Minas Tirith. First rode Elrohir and Elladan with a banner of silver, and 
then came Glorfindel and Erestor and all the household of Rivendell, and 
after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn, Lord of Lothlurien, riding 
upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked 
with white gems in their hair; and last came Master Elrond, mighty among 
Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Ann®minas, and beside him upon a 
grey 

palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people. 

And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on 
her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and 
he said to Gandalf: 'At last I understand why we have waited! This is the 
ending. Now not day only shall be beloved, but night too shall be beautiful 
and blessed and all its fear pass away!' 

Then the King welcomed his guests, and they alighted; and Elrond 
surrendered the sceptre, and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of 
the King, and together they went up into the High City, and all the stars 
flowered in the sky. And Aragorn the King Elessar wedded Arwen Undumiel 
in 

the City of the Kings upon the day of Midsummer, and the tale of their long 
waiting and labours was come to fulfilment. 




Chapter 6. Many Partings 



When the days of rejoicing were over at last the Companions thought of 
returning to their own homes. And Frodo went to the King as he was sitting 
with the Queen Arwen by the fountain, and she sang a song of Valinor, while 
the Tree grew and blossomed. They welcomed Frodo and rose to greet him; 
and 

Aragorn said: 

'I know what you have come to say, Frodo: you wish to return to your 
own home. Well, dearest friend, the tree grows best in the land of its 
sires; but for you in all the lands of the West there will ever be a 
welcome. And though your people have had little fame in the legends of the 
great, they will now have more renown than any wide realms that are no 
more.' 

'It is true that I wish to go back to the Shire,' said Frodo. 'But 
first I must go to Rivendell. For if there could be anything wanting in a 
time so blessed, I missed Bilbo; and I was grieved when among all the 
household of Elrond I saw that he was not come.' 

'Do you wonder at that, Ring-bearer?' said Arwen. 'For you know the 
power of that thing which is now destroyed; and all that was done by that 
power is now passing away. But your kinsman possessed this thing longer than 
you. He is ancient in years now, according to his kind; and he awaits you, 
for he will not again make any long journey save one.' 

'Then I beg leave to depart soon,' said Frodo. 

'In seven days we will go,' said Aragorn. 'For we shall ride with you 
far on the road, even as far as the country of Rohan. In three days now 
Jomer will return hither to bear Thjoden back to rest in the Mark, and we 
shall ride with him to honour the fallen. But now before you go I will 
confirm the words that Faramir spoke to you, and you are made free for ever 
of the realm of Gondor; and all your companions likewise. And if there were 
any gifts that I could give to match with your deeds you should have them; 
but whatever you desire you shall take with you, and you shall ride in 
honour and arrayed as princes of the land.' 

But the Queen Arwen said: 'A gift I will give you. For I am the 
daughter of Elrond. I shall not go with him now when he departs to the 




Havens; for mine is the choice of L®thien, and as she so have I chosen, both 
the sweet and the bitter. But in my stead you shall go, Ring-bearer, when 
the time comes, and if you then desire it. If your hurts grieve you still 
and the memory of your burden is heavy, then you may pass into the West, 
until all your wounds and weariness are healed. But wear this now in memory 
of Elfstone and Evenstar with whom your life has been woven!' 

And she took a white gem like a star that lay upon her breast hanging 
upon a silver chain, and she set the chain about Frodo's neck. ’When the 
memory of the fear and the darkness troubles you,' she said, 'this will 
bring you aid.' 

In three days, as the King had said, Jomer of Rohan came riding to the 
City, and with him came an jored of the fairest knights of the Mark. He was 
welcomed; and when they sat all at table in Merethrond, the Great Hall of 
Feasts, he beheld the beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with 
great wonder. And before he went to his rest he sent for Gimli the Dwarf, 
and he said to him: 'Gimli Gluin's son, have you your axe ready?' 

'Nay, lord,' said Gimli, 'but I can speedily fetch it, if there be 
need.' 

'You shall judge,' said Jomer. 'For there are certain rash words 
concerning the Fady in the Golden Wood that lie still between us. And now I 
have seen her with my eyes.' 

'Well, lord,' said Gimli, 'and what say you now?' 

'Alas!' said Jomer. 'I will not say that she is the fairest lady that 
lives.' 

'Then I must go for my axe,' said Gimli. 

'But first I will plead this excuse,' said Jomer. 'Had I seen her in 
other company, I would have said all that you could wish. But now I will put 
Queen Arwen Evenstar first, and I am ready to do battle on my own part with 
any who deny me. Shall I call for my sword?' 

Then Gimli bowed low. 'Nay, you are excused for my part, lord,' he 
said. 'You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the Morning. And 
my heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever.' 

At last the day of departure came, and a great and fair company made 
ready to ride north from the City. Then the kings of Gondor and Rohan went 
to the Hallows and they came to the tombs in Rath Dnnen, and they bore away 
King Thjoden upon a golden bier, and passed through the City in silence. 
Then they laid the bier upon a great wain with Riders of Rohan all about it 




and his banner borne before; and Merry being Thjoden's esquire rode upon the 
wain and kept the arms of the king. 

For the other Companions steeds were furnished according to their 
stature; and Frodo and Samwise rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon 
Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and 
Gimli 

as ever rode together upon Arod. 

In that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with 
their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of 
Ithilien, and many captains and knights. Never had any king of the Mark such 
company upon the road as went with Thjoden Thengel's son to the land of his 
home. 

Without haste and at peace they passed into Anurien, and they came to 
the Grey Wood under Amon D(n; and there they heard a sound as of drums 
beating in the hills, though no living thing could be seen. Then Aragorn let 
the trumpets be blown; and heralds cried: 

'Behold the King Elessar is come! The Forest of Dr®adan he gives to 
Ghvn-buri-ghvn and to his folk, to be their own for ever; and hereafter let 
no man enter it without their leave!' 

Then the drums rolled loudly, and were silent. 

At length after fifteen days of journey the wain of King Thjoden passed 
through the green fields of Rohan and came to Edoras; and there they all 
rested. The Golden Hall was arrayed with fair hangings and it was filled 
with light, and there was held the highest feast that it had known since the 
days of its building. For after three days the Men of the Mark prepared the 
funeral of Thjoden; and he was laid in a house of stone with his arms and 
many other fair things that he had possessed, and over him was raised a 
great mound, covered with green turves of grass and of white evermind. And 
now there were eight mounds on the east -side of the Barrowfield. 

Then the Riders of the King's House upon white horses rode round about 
the barrow and sang together a song of Thjoden Thengel's son that Gljowine 
his minstrel made, and he made no other song after. The slow voices of the 
Riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that 
people; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of 
the Mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of the North and 
the voice of Eorl crying above the battle upon the Field of Celebrant; and 
the tale of the kings rolled on, and the horn of Helm was loud in the 




mountains, until the Darkness came and King Thjoden arose and rode through 
the Shadow to the fire, and died in splendour, even as the Sun, returning 
beyond hope, gleamed upon Mindolluin in the morning. 

Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising 
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. 

Hope he rekindled, and in hope ended; 
over death, over dread, over doom lifted 
out of loss, out of life, unto long glory. 

But Merry stood at the foot of the green mound, and he wept, and when 
the song was ended he arose and cried: 

'Thjoden King, Thjoden King! Farewell! As a father you were to me. for 
a little while. Farewell!' 

When the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled, and 
Thjoden was left at last alone in his barrow, then folk gathered to the 
Golden Hall for the great feast and put away sorrow; for Thjoden had lived 
to full years and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires. 

And when the time came that in the custom of the Mark they should drink to 
the memory of the kings, Jowyn Lady of Rohan came forth, golden as the sun 
and white as snow, and she bore a filled cup to Jomer. 

Then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all the names of the 
Lords of the Mark in their order: Eorl the Young; and Brego builder of the 
Hall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless; and Frja, and Frjawine, and 
Goldwine, and Djor, and Gram; and Helm who lay hid in Helm's Deep when 
the 

Mark was overrun; and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that 
time the line was broken, and after came the mounds of the east-side: 
Frjalaf, Helm s sister-son, and Ljofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, 
and Fengel, and Thengel, and Thjoden the latest. And when Thjoden was 
named 

Jomer drained the cup. Then Jowyn bade those that served to fill the cups, 
and all there assembled rose and drank to the new king, crying: 'Hail, 
Jomer, King of the Mark!' 

At the last when the feast drew to an end Jomer arose and said: 'Now 
this is the funeral feast of Thjoden the King; but I will speak ere we go of 
tidings of joy, for he would not grudge that I should do so, since he was 
ever a father of Jowyn my sister. Hear then all my guests, fair folk of many 
realms, such as have never before been gathered in this hall! Faramir, 




Steward of Gondor, and Prince of Ithilien, asks that Jowyn Lady of Rohan 
should be his wife, and she grants it full willing. Therefore they shall be 
trothplighted before you all.' 

And Faramir and Jowyn stood forth and set hand in hand; and all there 
drank to them and were glad. 'Thus,' said Jomer, 'is the friendship of the 
Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.' 

'No niggard are you, Jomer,' said Aragorn, 'to give thus to Gondor the 
fairest thing in your realm!' 

Then Jowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: 'Wish me joy, 
my liege-lord and healer!' 

And he answered: 'I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw thee. 

It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.' 

When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Jomer. 
Aragorn and his knights, and the people of Lurien and of Ri vendell, made 
ready to ride; but Faramir and Imrahil remained at Edoras; and Arwen 
Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren. None saw her 
last meeting with Elrond her father, for they went up into the hills and 
there spoke long together, and bitter was their parting that should endure 
beyond the ends of the world. 

At the last before the guests set oat Jomer and Jowyn came to Merry, 
and they said: 'Farewell now, Meriadoc of the Shire and Holdwine of the 
Mark! Ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to our welcome!' 

And Jomer said: 'Kings of old would have laden you with gifts that a 
wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of Mundburg; and yet you 
will take naught, you say, but the arms that were given to you. This I 
suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to 
receive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns of the 
Mark at the coming of the morning.' 

Then Jowyn gave to Merry an ancient horn, small but cunningly wrought 
all of fair silver with a baldric of green; and wrights had engraven upon it 
swift horsemen riding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the 
mouth; and there were set runes of great virtue. 

'This is an heirloom of our house,' said Jowyn. 'It was made by the 
Dwarves, and came from the hoard of Scatha the Worm. Eorl the Young 
brought 

it from the North. He that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts of 
his enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends, and they shall hear him 




and come to him.' 

Then Merry took the horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed 
Jowyn's hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time. 

Now the guests were ready, and they drank the stirrup-cup, and with 
great praise and friendship they departed, and came at length to Helm's 
Deep, and there they rested two days. Then Legolas repaid his promise to 
Gimli and went with him to the Glittering Caves; and when they returned he 
was silent, and would say only that Gimli alone could find fit words to 
speak of them. 'And never before has a Dwarf claimed a victory over an Elf 
in a contest of words,' said he. 'Now therefore let us go to Fangorn and set 
the score right!' 

From Deeping-coomb they rode to Isengard, and saw how the Ents had 
busied themselves. All the stone-circle had been thrown down and removed, 
and the land within was made into a garden filled with orchards and trees, 
and a stream ran through it; but in the midst of all there was a lake of 
clear water, and out of it the Tower of Orthanc rose still, tall and 
impregnable, and its black rock was mirrored in the pool. 

For a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of Isengard had 
stood, and there were now two tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of 
a green -bordered path that ran towards Orthanc; and they looked in wonder at 
the work that had been done, but no living thing could they see far or near. 
But presently they heard a voice calling hoom-hom, hoom-hom; and there 
came 

Treebeard striding down the path to greet them with Quickbeam at his side. 

'Welcome to the Treegarth of Orthanc!' he said. 'I knew that you were 
coming, but I was at work up the valley; there is much still to be done. But 
you have not been idle either away in the south and the east, I hear; and 
all that I hear is good, very good.' Then Treebeard praised all their deeds, 
of which he seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked 
long at Gandalf . 

'Well, come now!' he said. 'You have proved mightiest, and all your 
labours have gone well. Where now would you be going? And why do you 
come 
here?' 

'To see how your work goes, my friend,' said Gandalf, 'and to thank you 
for your aid in all that has been achieved.' 

'Hoom, well, that is fair enough,' said Treebeard; 'for to be sure Ents 




have played their part. And not only in dealing with that, hoom, that 
accursed tree-slayer that dwelt here. For there was a great inrush of those, 
burbrum, those evileyed - blackhanded - bowlegged - flinthearted - 
clawfingered - foulbellied - bloodthirsty, morimciite - sincahonda, hoom , 
well, since you are hasty folk and their full name is as long as years of 
torment, those vermin of ores; and they came over the River and down from 
the North and all round the wood of Laurelindurenan, which they could not 
get into, thanks to the Great ones who are here.’ He bowed to the Lord and 
Lady of Lurien. 

'And these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet us out 
on the Wold, for they had not heard of us before; though that might be said 
also of better folk. And not many will remember us, for not many escaped us 
alive, and the River had most of those. But it was well for you, for if they 
had not met us, then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far, 
and if he had there would have been no home to return to.' 

'We know it well,' said Aragorn, 'and never shall it be forgotten in 
Minas Tirith or in Edoras.' 

' Never is too long a word even for me,' said Treebeard. 'Not while your 
kingdoms last, you mean; but they will have to last long indeed to seem long 
to Ents.' 

'The New Age begins,' said Gandalf, 'and in this age it may well prove 
that the kingdoms of Men shall outlast you, Fangorn my friend. But now come 
tell me: what of the task that I set you? How is Saruman? Is he not weary of 
Orthanc yet? For I do not suppose that he will think you have improved the 
view from his windows.' 

Treebeard gave Gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, Merry thought. 
'Ah!' he said. 'I thought you would come to that. Weary of Orthanc? Very 
weary at last; but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice. 
Hooml I gave him some long tales, or at least what might be thought long in 
your speech.' 

'Then why did he stay to listen? Did you go into Orthanc?' asked 
Gandalf. 

'Hoom, no, not into Orthanc!' said Treebeard. 'But he came to his 
window and listened, because he could not get news in any other way, and 
though he hated the news, he was greedy to have it; and I saw that he heard 
it all. But I added a great many things to the news that it was good for him 
to think of. He grew very weary. He always was hasty. That was his ruin.' 




1 observe, my good Fangorn,' said Gandalf, 'that with great care you 
say dwelt, was, grew. What about is? Is he dead?' 

’No, not dead, so far as I know,' said Treebeard. 'But he is gone. Yes, 
he is gone seven days. I let him go. There was little left of him when he 
crawled out, and as for that worm-creature of his, he was like a pale 
shadow. Now do not tell me, Gandalf, that I promised to keep him safe; for I 
know it. But things have changed since then. And I kept him until he was 
safe, safe from doing any more harm. You should know that above all I hate 
the caging of live things, and I will not keep even such creatures as these 
caged beyond great need. A snake without fangs may crawl where he will.' 

'You may be right,' said Gandalf; 'but this snake had still one tooth 
left, I think. He had the poison of his voice, and I guess that he persuaded 
you, even you Treebeard, knowing the soft spot in your heart. Well, he is 
gone, and there is no more to be said. But the Tower of Orthanc now goes 
back to the King, to whom it belongs. Though maybe he will not need it.' 

'That will be seen later,' said Aragorn. 'But I will give to Ents all 
this valley to do with as they will, so long as they keep a watch upon 
Orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave.' 

'It is locked,' said Treebeard. 'I made Saruman lock it and give me the 
keys. Quickbeam has them.' 

Quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to Aragorn 
two great black keys of intricate shape, joined by a ring of steel. 'Now I 
thank you once more,' said Aragorn, 'and I bid you farewell. May your forest 
grow again in peace. When this valley is filled there is room and to spare 
west of the mountains, where once you walked long ago.' 

Treebeard's face became sad. 'Forests may grow,' he said. 'Woods may 
spread. But not Ents. There are no Entings.' 

'Yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,' said Aragorn. 'Lands 
will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.' 

But Treebeard shook his head and said: 'It is far to go. And there are 
too many Men there in these days. But I am forgetting my manners! Will you 
stay here and rest a while? And maybe there are some that would be pleased 
to pass through Fangorn Forest and so shorten their road home?' He looked at 
Celeborn and Galadriel. 

But all save Legolas said that they must now take their leave and 
depart, either south or west. 'Come, Gimli!' said Legolas. 'Now by Fangorn's 
leave I will visit the deep places of the Entwood and see such trees as are 




nowhere else to be found in Middle-earth. You shall come with me and keep 
your word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in Mirkwood 
and beyond.' To this Gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed. 

'Here then at last comes the ending of the Fellowship of the Ring,' 
said Aragorn. 'Yet I hope that ere long you will return to my land with the 
help that you promised.' 

'We will come, if our own lords allow it,' said Gimli. 'Well, farewell, 
my hobbits! You should come safe to your own homes now, and I shall not be 
kept awake for fear of your peril. We will send word when we may, and some 
of us may yet meet at times; but I fear that we shall not all be gathered 
together ever again.' 

Then Treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed 
three times slowly and with great reverence to Celeborn and Galadriel. 'It 
is long, long since we met by stock or by stone, A vanimar, vanimblion 
nostari!' he said. 'It is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending. 

For the world is changing: I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, 
and I smell it in the air. I do not think we shall meet again.' 

And Celeborn said: 'I do not know, Eldest.' But Galadriel said: 'Not in 
Middle -earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up 
again. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet in the Spring. 
Farewell!' 

Last of all Merry and Pippin said good-bye to the old Ent, and he grew 
gayer as he looked at them. 'Well, my merry folk,' he said, 'will you drink 
another draught with me before you go?' 

'Indeed we will,' they said, and he took them aside into the shade of 
one of the trees, and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set. 

And Treebeard filled three bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange 
eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl. 'Take care take care!' he 
said. 'For you have already grown since I saw you last.' And they laughed 
and drained their bowls. 

'Well, good-bye!' he said. 'And don't forget that if you hear any news 
of the Entwives in your land, you will send word to me.' Then he waved his 
great hands to all the company and went off into the trees. 

The travellers now rode with more speed, and they made their way 
towards the Gap of Rohan; and Aragorn took leave of them at last close to 
that very place where Pippin had looked into the Stone of Orthanc. The 




Hobbits were grieved at this parting; for Aragorn had never failed them and 
he had been their guide through many perils. 

'I wish we could have a Stone that we could see all our friends in,' 
said Pippin, ’and that we could speak to them from far away!' 

'Only one now remains that you could use,' answered Aragorn for you 
would not wish to see what the Stone of Minas Tirith would show you. But the 
Palantnr of Orthanc the King will keep, to see what is passing in his realm, 
and what his servants are doing. For do not forget, Peregrin Took, that you 
are a knight of Gondor, and I do not release you from your service. You are 
going now on leave, but I may recall you. And remember, dear friends of the 
Shire, that my realm lies also in the North, and I shall come there one 
day.' 

Then Aragorn took leave of Celeborn and Galadriel; and the Lady said to 
him: 'Elfstone, through darkness you have come to your hope, and have now 
all your desire. Use well the days!' 

But Celeborn said: 'Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other than 
mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!' 

With that they parted, and it was then the time of sunset; and when 
after a while they turned and looked back, they saw the King of the West 
sitting upon his horse with his knights about him; and the falling Sun shone 
upon them and made all their harness to gleam like red gold, and the white 
mantle of Aragorn was turned to a flame. Then Aragorn took the green stone 
and held it up, and there came a green fire from his hand. 

Soon the dwindling company, following the Isen, turned west and rode 
through the Gap into the waste lands beyond, and then they turned 
northwards, and passed over the borders of Dunland. The Dunlendings fled and 
hid themselves, for they were afraid of Elvish Folk, though few indeed ever 
came to their country; but the travellers did not heed them, for they were 
still a great company and were well provided with all that they needed; and 
they went on their way at their leisure, setting up their tents when they 
would. 

On the sixth day since their parting from the King they journeyed 
through a wood climbing down from the hills at the feet of the Misty 
Mountains that now marched on their right hand. As they came out again into 
the open country at sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff, and 
he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty white, and at his heels went another 
beggar, slouching and whining. 




'Well Saruman!' said Gandalf. ’Where are you going?' 

'What is that to you?' he answered. 'Will you still order my goings, 
and are you not content with my ruin?' 

'You know the answers,' said Gandalf: 'no and no. But in any case the 
time of my labours now draws to an end. The King has taken on the burden. If 
you had waited at Orthanc, you would have seen him, and he would have 
shown 

you wisdom and mercy.' 

'Then all the A more reason to have left sooner,' said Saruman; 'for I 
desire neither of him. Indeed if you wish for an answer to your first 
question, I am seeking a way out of his realm.' 

'Then once more you are going the wrong way,' said Gandalf, 'and I see 
no hope in your journey. But will you scorn our help? For we offer it to 
you.' 

'To me?' said Saruman. 'Nay, pray do not smile at me! I prefer your 
frowns. And as for the Lady here, I do not trust her: she always hated me, 
and schemed for your part. I do not doubt that she has brought you this way 
to have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty. Had I been warned of your 
pursuit, I would have denied you the pleasure.' 

'Saruman,' said Galadriel, 'we have other errands and other cares that 
seem to us more urgent than hunting for you. Say rather that you are 
overtaken by good fortune; for now you have a last chance.' 

'If it be truly the last, I am glad,' said Saruman; 'for I shall be 
spared the trouble of refusing it again. All my hopes are ruined, but I 
would not share yours. If you have any.' 

For a moment his eyes kindled. 'Go!' he said. 'I did not spend long 
study on these matters for naught. You have doomed yourselves, and you 
know 

it. And it will afford me some comfort as I wander to think that you pulled 
down your own house when you destroyed mine. And now, what ship will 
bear 

you back across so wide a sea?' he mocked. 'It will be a grey ship, and full 
of ghosts.' He laughed, but his voice was cracked and hideous. 

'Get up, you idiot!' he shouted to the other beggar, who had sat down 
on the ground; and he struck him with his staff. 'Turn about! If these fine 
folk are going our way, then we will take another. Get on, or I'll give you 
no crust for your supper!' 




The beggar turned and slouched past whimpering: 'Poor old Grnma! Poor 
old Grnma! Always beaten and cursed. How I hate him! I wish I could leave 
him!' 

'Then leave him!' said Gandalf. 

But Wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at 
Gandalf, and then shuffled quickly past behind Saruman. As the wretched pair 
passed by the company they came to the hobbits, and Saruman stopped and 
stared at them; but they looked at him with pity. 

'So you have come to gloat too, have you, my urchins?' he said. 'You 
don't care what a beggar lacks, do you? For you have all you want, food and 
fine clothes, and the best weed for your pipes. Oh yes, I know! I know where 
it comes from. You would not give a pipeful to a beggar, would you?' 

'I would, if I had any,' said Frodo. 

'You can have what I have got left,' said Merry, 'if you will wait a 
moment.' He got down and searched in the bag at his saddle. Then he handed 
to Saruman a leather pouch. 'Take what there is,' he said. 'You are welcome 
to it; it came from the flotsam of Isengard.' 

'Mine, mine, yes and dearly bought!' cried Saruman, clutching at the 
pouch. 'This is only a repayment in token; for you took more, I'll be bound. 
Still, a beggar must be grateful, if a thief returns him even a morsel of 
his own. Well, it will serve you right when you come home, if you find 
things less good in the Southfarthing than you would like. Long may your 
land be short of leaf!' 

'Thank you!' said Merry. 'In that case I will have my pouch back, which 
is not yours and has journeyed far with me. Wrap the weed in a rag of your 
own.' 

'One thief deserves another,' said Saruman, and turned his back on 
Merry, and kicked Wormtongue, and went away towards the wood. 

'Well, I like that!' said Pippin. 'Thief indeed! What of our claim for 
waylaying, wounding, and ore-dragging us through Rohan?' 

'Ah!' said Sam. 'And bought he said. How, I wonder? And I didn't like 
the sound of what he said about the Southfarthing. It's time we got back.' 

'I'm sure it is,' said Frodo. 'But we can't go any quicker, if we are 
to see Bilbo. I am going to Rivendell first, whatever happens.' 

'Yes, I think you had better do that,' said Gandalf. 'But alas for 
Saruman! I fear nothing more can be made of him. He has withered altogether. 
All the same, I am not sure that Treebeard is right: I fancy he could do 




some mischief still in a small mean way.' 

Next day they went on into northern Dunland, where no men now dwelt, 
though it was a green and pleasant country. September came in with golden 
days and silver nights, and they rode at ease until they reached the 
Swanfleet river, and found the old ford, east of the falls where it went 
down suddenly into the lowlands. Far to the west in a haze lay the meres and 
eyots through which it wound its way to the Greyflood: there countless swans 
housed in a land of reeds. 

So they passed into Eregion, and at last a fair morning dawned, 
shimmering above gleaming mists; and looking from their camp on a low hill 
the travellers saw away in the east the Sun catching three peaks that thrust 
up into the sky through floating clouds: Caradhras, Celebdil, and Fanuidhol. 
They were near to the Gates of Moria. 

Here now for seven days they tarried, for the time was at hand for 
another parting which they were loth to make. Soon Celeborn and Galadriel 
and their folk would turn eastward, and so pass by the Redhorn Gate and down 
the Dimrill Stair to the Silverlode and to their own country. They had 
journeyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with 
Elrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their 
friends. Often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they would sit 
together under the stars, recalling the ages that were gone and all their 
joys and labours in the world, or holding council, concerning the days to 
come. If any wanderer had chanced to pass, little would he have seen or 
heard, and it would have seemed to him only that he saw grey figures, carved 
in stone, memorials of forgotten things now lost in unpeopled lands. For 
they did not move or speak with mouth, looking from mind to mind; and only 
their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro. 

But at length all was said, and they parted again for a while, until it 
was time for the Three Rings to pass away. Quickly fading into the stones 
and the shadows the grey-cloaked people of Lurien rode towards the 
mountains; and those who were going to Rivendell sat on the hill and 
watched, until there came out of the gathering mist a flash; and then they 
saw no more. Frodo knew that Galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of 
farewell. 

Sam turned away and sighed: 'I wish I was going back to Lurien!' 

At last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly as to 
travellers it always seemed, to the brink of the deep valley of Rivendell 




and saw far below the lamps shining in Elrond's house. And they went down 
and crossed the bridge and came to the doors, and all the house was filled 
with light and song for joy at Elrond's homecoming. 

First of all, before they had eaten or washed or even shed their 
cloaks, the hobbits went in search of Bilbo. They found him all alone in his 
little room. It was littered with papers and pens and pencils; but Bilbo was 
sitting in a chair before a small bright fire. He looked very old, but 
peaceful, and sleepy. 

He opened his eyes and looked up as they came in. 'Hullo, hullo!' he 
said. 'So you've come back? And tomorrow's my birthday, too. How clever of 
you! Do you know, I shall be one hundred and twenty -nine? And in one year 
more, if I am spared, I shall equal the Old Took. I should like to beat him; 
but we shall see.' 

After the celebration of Bilbo's birthday the four hobbits stayed in 
Rivendell for some days, and they sat much with their old friend, who spent 
most of his time now in his room, except at meals. For these he was still 
very punctual as a rule, and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them. 
Sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of 
their journeys and adventures. At first he pretended to take some notes; but 
he often fell asleep; and when he woke he would say: 'How splendid! How 
wonderful! But where were we?' Then they went on with the story from the 
point where he had begun to nod. 

The only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his attention 
was the account of the crowning and marriage of Aragorn. 'I was invited to 
the wedding of course,' he said. 'And I have waited for it long enough. But 
somehow, when it came to it, I found I had so much to do here; and packing 
is such a bother.' 

When nearly a fortnight had passed Frodo looked out of his window and 
saw that there had been a frost in the night, and the cobwebs were like 
white nets. Then suddenly he knew that he must go, and say good-bye to 
Bilbo. The weather was still calm and fair, after one of the most lovely 
summers that people could remember; but October had come, and it must 
break 

soon and begin to rain and blow again. And there was still a very long way 
to go. Yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him. He 
had a feeling that it was time he went back to the Shire. Sam shared it. 

Only the night before he had said: 




'Well, Mr. Frodo, we’ve been far and seen a deal, and yet I don't think 
we've found a better place than this. There's something of everything here, 
if you understand me: the Shire and the Golden Wood and Gondor and kings' 
houses and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed. And yet, somehow, 

I 

feel we ought to be going soon. I'm worried about my gaffer, to tell you the 
truth.' 

'Yes, something of everything, Sam, except the Sea,' Frodo had 
answered; and he repeated it now to himself: 'Except the Sea.' 

That day Frodo spoke to Elrond, and it was agreed that they should 
leave the next morning. To their delight Gandalf said: 'I think I shall come 
too. At least as far as Bree. I want to see Butterbur.' 

In the evening they went to say good-bye to Bilbo. 'Well, if you must 
go, you must,' he said. 'I am sorry. I shall miss you. It is nice just to 
know that you are about the place. But I am getting very sleepy.' Then he 
gave Frodo his mithril-coat and Sting, forgetting that he had already done 
so; and he gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various 
times, written in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: 
Translations from the Elvish, by B.B. 

To Sam he gave a little bag of gold. 'Almost the last drop of the Smaug 
vintage,' he said. May come in useful, if you think of getting married, 

Sam.' Sam blushed. 

'I have nothing much to give to you young fellows,' he said to Merry 
and Pippin, 'except good advice.' And when he had given them a fair sample 
of this, he added a last item in Shire-fashion: 'Don't let your heads get 
too big for your hats! But if you don't finish growing up soon, you are 
going to find hats and clothes expensive.' 

'But if you want to beat the Old Took,' said Pippin, 'I don't see why 
we shouldn't try and beat the Bullroarer.' 

Bilbo laughed, and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with 
pearl mouth-pieces and bound with fine-wrought silver. 'Think of me when you 
smoke them!' he said. 'The Elves made them for me, but I don't smoke now.' 
And then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little; and when he woke 
up again he said: 'Now where were we? Yes, of course, giving presents. Which 
reminds me: what's become of my ring, Frodo, that you took away?' 

'I have lost it, Bilbo dear,' said Frodo. 'I got rid of it, you know.' 

'What a pity!' said Bilbo. 'I should have liked to see it again. But 




no, how silly of me! That's what you went for, wasn’t it: to get rid of it? 

But it is all so confusing, for such a lot of other things seem to have got 
mixed up with it: Aragorn's affairs, and the White Council and Gondor, and 
the Horsemen, and Southrons, and oliphaunts - did you really see one, Sam? - 
and caves and towers and golden trees, and goodness knows what besides. 

'I evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip. I 
think Gandalf might have shown me round a bit. But then the auction would 
have been over before I got back, and I should have had even more trouble 
than I did. Anyway it's too late now; and really I think it's much more 
comfortable to sit here and hear about it all. The fire's very cosy here, 
and the food's very good, and there are Elves when you want them. What more 
could one want? 

The Road goes ever on and on 
Out from the door where it began. 

Now far ahead the Road has gone, 

Let others follow it who can! 

Let them a journey new begin, 

But I at last with weary feet 
Will turn towards the lighted inn, 

My evening-rest and sleep to meet. ' 

And as Bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and 
he slept soundly. 

The evening deepened in the room, and the firelight burned brighter; 
and they looked at Bilbo as he slept and saw that his face was smiling. For 
some time they sat in silence; and then Sam looking round at the room and 
the shadows flickering on the walls, said softly: 

'I don't think, Mr. Frodo, that he's done much writing while we've been 
away. He won't ever write our story now.' 

At that Bilbo opened an eye, almost as if he had heard. Then he roused 
himself. 'You see, I am getting so sleepy,' he said. 'And when I have time 
to write, I only really like writing poetry. I wonder, Frodo my dear fellow, 
if you would very much mind tidying things up a bit before you go? Collect 
all my notes and papers, and my diary too, and take them with you, if you 
will. You see, I haven't much time for the selection and the arrangement and 
all that. Get Sam to help, and when you've knocked things into shape, come 
back, and I'll run over it. I won't be too critical.' 

'Of course I'll do it!' said Frodo. 'And of course I'll come back soon: 




it won’t be dangerous any more. There is a real king now and he will soon 
put the roads in order.' 

’Thank you, my dear fellow!’ said Bilbo. 'That really is a very great 
relief to my mind.' And with that he fell fast asleep again. 

The next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave of Bilbo in his room, 
for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond and all 
his household. 

As Frodo stood upon the threshold, Elrond wished him a fair journey, 
and blessed him, and he said: 

'I think, Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you 
come very soon. For about this time of the year, when the leaves are gold 
before they fall, look for Bilbo in the woods of the Shire. I shall be with 
him.' 

These words no one else heard, and Frodo kept them to himself. 




Chapter 7 . Homeward Bound 



At last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home. They were 
eager now to see the Shire again; but at first they rode only slowly, for 
Frodo had been ill at ease. When they came to the Ford of Bruinen, he had 
halted, and seemed loth to ride into the stream; and they noted that for a 
while his eyes appeared not to see them or things about him. All that day he 
was silent. It was the sixth of October. 

'Are you in pain, Frodo?' said Gandalf quietly as he rode by Frodo's 
side. 

'Well, yes I am,' said Frodo. 'It is my shoulder. The wound aches, and 
the memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was a year ago today.' 

'Alas! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,' said 
Gandalf. 

'I fear it may be so with mine,' said Frodo. 'There is no real going 
back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall 
not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long 
burden. Where shall I find rest?' 

Gandalf did not answer. 

By the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed, and Frodo 
was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day 
before. After that the journey went well, and the days went quickly by; for 
they rode at leisure, and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where 
the leaves were red and yellow in the autumn sun. At length they came to 
Weathertop; and it was then drawing towards evening and the shadow of the 
hill lay dark on the road. Then Frodo begged them to hasten, and he would 
not look towards the hill, but rode through its shadow with head bowed and 
cloak drawn close about him. That night the weather changed, and a wind came 
from the West laden with rain, and it blew loud and chill, and the yellow 
leaves whirled like birds in the air. When they came to the Chetwood already 
the boughs were almost bare, and a great curtain of rain veiled Bree Hill 
from their sight. 

So it was that near the end of a wild and wet evening in the last days 
of October the five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the 
South-gate of Bree. It was locked fast; and the rain blew in their faces, 




and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying by, and their hearts sank 
a little, for they had expected more welcome. 

When they had called many times, at last the Gate-keeper came out, and 
they saw that he carried a great cudgel. He looked at them with fear and 
suspicion; but when he saw that Gandalf was there, and that his companions 
were hobbits, in spite of their strange gear, then he brightened and wished 
them welcome. 

’Come in!' he said, unlocking the gate. 'We won’t stay for news out 
here in the cold and the wet, a ruffianly evening. But old Barley will no 
doubt give you a welcome at The Pony, and there you'll hear all there is to 
hear.' 

'And there you'll hear later all that we say, and more,' laughed 
Gandalf. 'How is Harry?' 

The Gate-keeper scowled. 'Gone,' he said. 'But you'd best ask Barliman. 
Good evening!' 

'Good evening to you!' they said, and passed through; and then they 
noticed that behind the hedge at the road-side a long low hut had been 
built, and a number of men had come out and were staring at them over the 
fence. When they came to Bill Ferny's house they saw that the hedge there 
was tattered and unkempt, and the windows were all boarded up. 

'Do you think you killed him with that apple, Sam?' said Pippin. 

'I'm not so hopeful, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam. 'But I'd like to know what 
became of that poor pony. He's been on my mind many a time and the wolves 
howling and all.' 

At last they came to The Prancing Pony, and that at least looked 
outwardly unchanged; and there were lights behind the red curtains in the 
lower windows. They rang the bell, and Nob came to the door, and opened it a 
crack and peeped through; and when he saw them standing under the lamp he 
gave a cry of surprise. 

'Mr. Butterbur! Master!' he shouted. 'They've come back!' 

'Oh have they? I'll learn them,' came Butterbur's voice, and out he 
came with a rush, and he had a club in his hand. But when he saw who they 
were he stopped short, and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and 
delight. 

'Nob, you woolly -pated ninny!' he cried. 'Can't you give old friends 
their names? You shouldn't go scaring me like that, with times as they are. 




Well, well! And where have you come from? I never expected to see any of 
you 

folk again, and that's a fact: going off into the Wild with that Strider, 
and all those Black Men about. But I'm right glad to see you, and none more 
than Gandalf. Come in! Come in! The same rooms as - before? They're free. 
Indeed most rooms are empty these days, as I'll not hide from you, for 
you'll find it out soon enough. And I'll see what can be done about supper, 
as soon as may be; but I'm short-handed at present. Hey, Nob you slowcoach! 
Tell Bob! Ah, but there I'm forgetting, Bob's gone: goes home to his folk at 
nightfall now. Well, take the guests' ponies to the stables, Nob! And you'll 
be taking your horse to his stable yourself Gandalf; I don't doubt. A fine 
beast, as I said when I first set eyes on him. Well, come in! Make 
yourselves at home!' 

Mr. Butterbur had at any rate not changed his manner of talking, and 
still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle. And yet there was hardly 
anybody about, and all was quiet; from the Common Room there came a 
low 

murmur of no more than two or three voices. And seen closer in the light of 
two candles that he lit and carried before them the landlord's face looked 
rather wrinkled and careworn. 

He led them down the passage to the parlour that they had used on that 
strange night more than a year ago; and they followed him, a little 
disquieted, for it seemed plain to them that old Barliman was putting a 
brave face on some trouble. Things were not what they had been. But they 
said nothing, and waited. 

As they expected Mr. Butterbur came to the parlour after supper to see 
if all had been to their liking. As indeed it had: no change for the worse 
had yet come upon the beer or the victuals at The Pony at any rate. 'Now I 
won't make so bold as to suggest you should come to the Common Room 
tonight,' said Butterbur. 'You'll be tired; and there isn't many folk there 
this evening, anyway. But if you could spare me half an hour before you go 
to your beds, I would dearly like to have some talk with you, quiet-like by 
ourselves.' 

'That is just what we should like, too,' said Gandalf. 'We are not 
tired. We have been taking things easy. We were wet, cold and hungry, but 
all that you have cured. Come, sit down! And if you have any pipe-weed, 
we'll bless you.' 




'Well, if you’d called for anything else, I'd have been happier,' said 
Butterbur. 'That's just a thing that we're short of, seeing how we've only 
got what we grow ourselves, and that's not enough. There's none to be had 
from the Shire these days. But I'll do what I can.' 

When he came back he brought them enough to last them for a day or two, 
a wad of uncut leaf. 'Southlinch,' he said, 'and the best we have; but not 
the match of Southfarthing, as I've always said though I'm all for Bree in 
most matters, begging your pardon.' 

They put him in a large chair by the wood-fire, and Gandalf sat on the 
other side of the hearth, and the hobbits in low chairs between them; and 
then they talked for many times half an hour, and exchanged all such news as 
Mr. Butterbur wished to hear or give. Most of the things which they had to 
tell were a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host, and far beyond his 
vision; and they brought forth few comments other than: 'You don't say; 
often repeated in defiance of the evidence of Mr. Butterbur's own ears. 'You 
don't say, Mr. Baggins, or is it Mr. Underhill? I'm getting so mixed up. You 
don't say, Master Gandalf! Well I never! Who'd have thought it in our 
times!' 

But he did say much on his own account. Things were far from well, he 
would say. Business was not even fair, it was downright bad. 'No one comes 
nigh Bree now from Outside,' he said. 'And the inside folks, they stay at 
home mostly and keep their doors barred. It all comes of those newcomers and 
gangrels that began coming up the Greenway last year, as you may remember; 
but more came later. Some were just poor bodies running away from trouble; 
but most were bad men, full o' thievery and mischief. And there was trouble 
right here in Bree, bad trouble. Why, we had a real set-to, and there were 
some folk killed, killed dead! If you'll believe me.' 

'I will indeed,' said Gandalf. 'How many?' 

'Three and two,' said Butterbur, referring to the big folk and the 
little. 'There was poor Mat Heathertoes, and Rowlie Appledore, and little 
Tom Pickthorn from over the Hill; and Willie Banks from up-away, and one of 
the Underhills from Staddle: all good fellows, and they're missed. And Harry 
Goatleaf that used to be on the West-gate, and that Bill Ferny, they came in 
on the strangers' side, and they've gone off with them; and it's my belief 
they let them in. On the night of the fight, I mean. And that was after we 
showed them the gates and pushed them out: before the year's end, that was; 
and the fight was early in the New Year, after the heavy snow we had. 




'And now they're gone for robbers and live outside, hiding in the woods 
beyond Archet, and out in the wilds north-away. It's like a bit of the bad 
old times tales tell of, I say. It isn't safe on the road and nobody goes 
far, and folk lock up early. We have to keep watchers all round the fence 
and put a lot of men on the gates at nights.' 

'Well, no one troubled us,' said Pippin, 'and we came along slowly, and 
kept no watch. We thought we'd left all trouble behind us.' 

'Ah, that you haven't, Master, more's the pity,' said Butterbur. 'But 
it's no wonder they left you alone. They wouldn't go for armed folk, with 
swords and helmets and shields and all. Make them think twice, that would. 
And I must say it put me aback a bit when I saw you.' 

Then the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked at them with 
amazement not out of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their 
gear. They themselves had become so used to warfare and to riding in 
well-arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that the bright mail 
peeping from under their cloaks, and the helms of Gondor and the Mark, and 
the fair devices on their shields, would seem outlandish in their own 
country. And Gandalf, too, was now riding on his tall grey horse, all clad 
in white with a great mantle of blue and silver over all, and the long sword 
Glamdring at his side. 

Gandalf laughed. 'Well, well,' he said, 'if they are afraid of just 
five of us, then we have met worse enemies on our travels. But at any rate 
they will give you peace at night while we stay.' 

'How long will that be?' said Butterbur. 'I'll not deny we should be 
glad to have you about for a bit. You see, we're not used to such troubles; 
and the Rangers have all gone away, folk tell me. I don't think we've 
rightly understood till now what they did for us. For there's been worse 
than robbers about. Wolves were howling round the fences last winter. And 
there's dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that it makes the blood 
run cold to think of. It's been very disturbing, if you understand me.' 

'I expect it has,' said Gandalf. 'Nearly all lands have been disturbed 
these days, very disturbed. But cheer up, Barliman! You have been on the 
edge of very great troubles, and I am only glad to hear that you have not 
been deeper in. But better times are coming. Maybe, better than any you 
remember. The Rangers have returned. We came back with them. And there is 
a 

king again, Barliman. He will soon be turning his mind this way. 




'Then the Greenway will be opened again, and his messengers will come 
north, and there will be comings and goings, and the evil things will be 
driven out of the waste-lands. Indeed the waste in time will be waste no 
longer, and there will be people and fields where once there was 
wilderness.' 

Mr. Butterbur shook his head. 'If there's a few decent respectable folk 
on the roads, that won't do no harm,' he said. 'But we don't want no more 
rabble and ruffians. And we don't want no outsiders at Bree, nor near Bree 
at all. We want to be let alone. I don't want a whole crowd o' strangers 
camping here and settling there and tearing up the wild country.' 

'You will be let alone, Barliman,' said Gandalf. 'There is room enough 
for realms between Isen and Greyflood, or along the shore lands south of the 
Brandywine, without any one living within many days' ride of Bree. And many 
folk used to dwell away north, a hundred miles or more from here, at the far 
end of the Greenway: on the North Downs or by Lake Evendim.' 

'Up away by Deadmen's Dike?' said Butterbur, looking even more dubious. 
'That's haunted land, they say. None but a robber would go there.' 

'The Rangers go there,' said Gandalf. 'Deadmen's Dike, you say. So it 
has been called for long years; but its right name, Barliman, is Fornost 
Erain, Norbury of the Kings. And the King will come there again one day; and 
then you'll have some fair folk riding through.' 

'Well, that sounds more hopeful, I'll allow,' said Butterbur. 'And it 
will be good for business, no doubt. So long as he lets Bree alone.' 

'He will,' said Gandalf. 'He knows it and loves it.' 

'Does he now?' said Butterbur looking puzzled. 'Though I'm sure I don't 
know why he should, sitting in his big chair up in his great castle, 
hundreds of miles away. And drinking wine out of a golden cup, I shouldn't 
wonder. What's The Pony to him, or mugs o' beer? Not but what my beer's 
good, Gandalf. It's been uncommon good, since you came in the autumn of last 
year and put a good word on it. And that's been a comfort in trouble, I will 
say.' 

'Ah!' said Sam. 'But he says your beer is always good.' 

'He says?' 

'Of course he does. He's Strider. The chief of the Rangers. Haven't you 
got that into your head yet?' 

It went in at last, and Butterbur's face was a study in wonder. The 
eyes in his broad face grew round, and his mouth opened wide, and he gasped. 




'Strider!' he exclaimed when he got back his breath. 'Him with a crown and 
all and a golden cup! Well, what are we coming to?' 

'Better times, for Bree at any rate,' said Gandalf. 

'I hope so, I'm sure,' said Butterbur. 'Well, this has been the nicest 
chat I've had in a month of Mondays. And I'll not deny that I'll sleep 
easier tonight and with a lighter heart. You've given me a powerful lot to 
think over, but I'll put that off until tomorrow. I'm for bed, and I've no 
doubt you'll be glad of your beds too. Hey, Nob!' he called, going to the 
door. 'Nob, you slowcoach!' 

'Now!' he said to himself, slapping his forehead. 'Now what does that 
remind me of?' 

'Not another letter you've forgotten. I hope, Mr. Butterbur?' said 
Merry. 

'Now, now, Mr. Brandybuck, don't go reminding me of that! But there, 
you've broken my thought. Now where was I? Nob, stables, ah! that was it. 
I've something that belongs to you. If you recollect Bill Ferny and the 
horsethieving: his pony as you bought, well, it's here. Come back all of 
itself, it did. But where it had been to you know better than me. It was as 
shaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes-rail, but it was alive. Nob's 
looked after it.' 

'What! My Bill?' cried Sam. 'Well, I was born lucky, whatever my gaffer 
may say. There's another wish come true! Where is he?' Sam would not go to 
bed until he had visited Bill in his stable. 

The travellers stayed in Bree all the next day, and Mr. Butterbur could 
not complain of his business next evening at any rate. Curiosity overcame 
all fears, and his house was crowded. For a while out of politeness the 
hobbits visited the Common Room in the evening and answered a good 
many 

questions. Bree memories being retentive, Frodo was asked many times if he 
had written his book. 

'Not yet,' he answered. 'I am going home now to put my notes in order.' 

He promised to deal with the amazing events at Bree, and so give a bit of 
interest to a book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote and 
less important affairs 'away south'. 

Then one of the younger folk called for a song. But at that a hush 
fell, and he was frowned down, and the call was not repeated. Evidently 
there was no wish for any uncanny events in the Common Room again. 




No trouble by day, nor any sound by night, disturbed the peace of Bree 
while the travellers remained there; but the next morning they got up early, 
for as the weather was still rainy they wished to reach the Shire before 
night, and it was a long ride. The Bree folk were all out to see them off, 
and were in merrier mood than they had been for a year; and those who had 
not seen the strangers in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them: 
at Gandalf with his white beard, and the light that seemed to gleam from 
him, as if his blue mantle was only a cloud over sunshine; and at the four 
hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales. Even those 
who had laughed at all the talk about the King began to think there might be 
some truth in it. 

'Well, good luck on your road, and good luck to your home-coming! said 
Mr. Butterbur. 'I should have warned you before that all's not well in the 
Shire neither, if what we hear is true. Funny goings on, they say. But one 
thing drives out another, and I was full of my own troubles. But if I may be 
so bold, you've come back changed from your travels, and you look now like 
folk as can deal with troubles out of hand. I don't doubt you'll soon set 
all to rights. Good luck to you! And the oftener you come back the better 
I'll be pleased.' 

They wished him farewell and rode away, and passed through the 
West-gate and on towards the Shire. Bill the pony was with them, and as 
before he had a good deal of baggage, but he trotted along beside Sam and 
seemed well content. 

'I wonder what old Barliman was hinting at,' said Frodo. 

'I can guess some of it,' said Sam gloomily. 'What I saw in the Mirror: 
trees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the Row. I ought to 
have hurried back quicker.' 

'And something's wrong with the Southfarthing evidently,' said Merry. 
'There's a general shortage of pipe- weed.' 

'Whatever it is,' said Pippin, 'Fotho will be at the bottom of it: you 
can be sure of that.' 

'Deep in, but not at the bottom,' said Gandalf. 'You have forgotten 
Saruman. He began to take an interest in the Shire before Mordor did.' 

'Well, we've got you with us,' said Merry, 'so things will soon be 
cleared up.' 

'I am with you at present,' said Gandalf, 'but soon I shall not be. I 
am not coming to the Shire. You must settle its affairs yourselves; that is 




what you have been trained for. Do you not yet understand? My time is over: 
it is no longer my task to set things to rights, nor to help folk to do so. 

And as for you, my dear friends, you will need no help. You are grown up 
now. Grown indeed very high; among the great you are, and I have no longer 
any fear at all for any of you. 

'But if you would know, I am turning aside soon. I am going to have a 
long talk with Bombadil: such a talk as I have not had in all my time. He is 
a moss -gatherer, and I have been a stone doomed to rolling. But my rolling 
days are ending, and now we shall have much to say to one another.' 

In a little while they came to the point on the East Road where they 
had taken leave of Bombadil; and they hoped and half expected to see him 
standing there to greet them as they went by. But there was no sign of him; 
and there was a grey mist on the Barrow-downs southwards, and a deep veil 
over the Old Forest far away. 

They halted and Frodo looked south wistfully. ’I should dearly like to 
see the old fellow again,’ he said. ’I wonder how he is getting on?’ 

’As well as ever, you may be sure,’ said Gandalf. 'Quite untroubled and 
I should guess, not much interested in anything that we have done or seen, 
unless perhaps in our visits to the Ents. There may be a time later for you 
to go and see him. But if I were you, I should press on now for home, or you 
will not come to the Brandywine Bridge before the gates are locked.' 

'But there aren't any gates,' said Merry, 'not on the Road; you know 
that quite well. There's the Buckland Gate, of course; but they'll let me 
through that at any time.' 

'There weren't any gates, you mean,' said Gandalf. 'I think you will 
find some now. And you might have more trouble even at the Buckland Gate 
than you think. But you'll! manage all right. Good-bye dear friends! Not for 
the last time, not yet. Good-bye!' 

He turned Shadowfax off the Road, and the great horse leaped the green 
dike that here ran beside it; and then at a cry from Gandalf he was gone, 
racing towards the Barrow-downs like a wind from the North. 

'Well here we are, just the four of us that started out together,' said 
Merry. 'We have left all the rest behind, one after another. It seems almost 
like a dream that has slowly faded.' 

'Not to me,' said Frodo. 'To me it feels more like falling asleep 
again.' 




Chapter 8 . The Scouring of the Shire 



It was after nightfall when, wet and tired, the travellers came at last 
to the Brandywine, and they found the way barred. At either end of the 
Bridge there was a great spiked gate; and on the further side of the river 
they could see that some new houses had been built: two-storeyed with narrow 
straight- sided windows, bare and dimly lit, all very gloomy and 
un-Shirelike. 

They hammered on the outer gate and called, but there was at first no 
answer; and then to their surprise someone blew a horn, and the lights in 
the windows went out. A voice shouted in the dark: 

’Who's that? Be off! You can't come in: Can't you read the notice: No 
admittance between sundown and sunrise ?' 

'Of course we can't read the notice in the dark.' Sam shouted back. 

'And if hobbits of the Shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like 
this, I'll tear down your notice when I find it.' 

At that a window slammed, and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns poured 
out of the house on the left. They opened the further gate, and some came 
over the bridge. When they saw the travellers they seemed frightened. 

'Come along!' said Merry, recognizing one of the hobbits. 'If you don't 
know me, Hob Hayward, you ought to. I am Merry Brandybuck, and I should 
like 

to know what all this is about, and what a Bucklander like you is doing 
here. You used to be on the Hay Gate.' 

'Bless me! If s Master Merry, to be sure, and all dressed up for 
fighting!' said old Hob. 'Why, they said you was dead! Lost in the Old 
Forest by all accounts. I'm pleased to see you alive after all!' 

'Then stop gaping at me through the bars, and open the gate!' said 
Merry. 

'I'm sorry, Master Merry, but we have orders.' 

'Whose orders?' 

'The Chiefs up at Bag End.' 

'Chief? Chief? Do you mean Mr. Lotho?' said Frodo. 

'I suppose so, Mr. Baggins; but we have to say just "the Chief" 
nowadays.' 




'Do you indeed!' said Frodo. 'Well, lam glad he has dropped the 
Baggins at any rate. But it is evidently high time that the family dealt 
with him and put him in his place.' 

A hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate. 'It won't do no good 
talking that way,' said one. 'He'll get to hear of it. And if you make so 
much noise, you'll wake the Chiefs Big Man.' 

'We shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him,' said Merry. 'If 
you mean that your precious Chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild, 
then we've not come back too soon.' He sprang from his pony, and seeing the 
notice in the light of the lanterns, he tore it down and threw it over the 
gate. The hobbits backed away and made no move to open it. 'Come on, 
Pippin!' said Merry. 'Two is enough.' 

Merry and Pippin climbed the gate, and the hobbits fled. Another horn 
sounded. Out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared 
against a light in the doorway. 

'What's all this,' he snarled as he came forward. 'Gate-breaking? You 
clear out, or I'll break your filthy little necks!' Then he stopped, for he 
had caught the gleam of swords. 

'Bill Ferny,' said Merry, 'if you don't open that gate in ten seconds, 
you'll regret it. I shall set steel to you, if you don't obey. And when you 
have opened the gates you will go through them and never return. You are a 
ruffian and a highway -robber.' 

Bill Ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it. 'Give me 
the key!' said Merry. But the ruffian flung it at his head and then darted 
out into the darkness. As he passed the ponies one of them let fly with his 
heels and just caught him as he ran. He went off with a yelp into the night 
and was never heard of again. 

'Neat work, Bill,' said Sam, meaning the pony. 

'So much for your Big Man,' said Merry. 'We'll see the Chief later. In 
the meantime we want a lodging for the night, and as you seem to have pulled 
down the Bridge Inn and built this dismal place instead, you'll have to put 
us up.' 

'I am sorry, Mr. Merry,' said Hob, 'but it isn't allowed.' 

'What isn't allowed?' 

Taking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food, and all that, said 
Hob. 

'What's the matter with the place?' said Merry. 'Has it been a bad 




year, or what? I thought it had been a fine summer and harvest.' 

'Well no, the year's been good enough,' said Hob. 'We grows a lot of 
food, but we don't rightly know what becomes of it. It's all these 
"gatherers" and "sharers", I reckon, going round counting and measuring and 
taking off to storage. They do more gathering than sharing, and we never see 
most of the stuff again.' 

'Oh come!' said Pippin yawning. 'This is all too tiresome for me 
tonight. We've got food in our bags. Just give us a room to lie down in. 

It'll be better than many places I have seen.' 

The hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease, evidently some rule 
or other was being broken; but there was no gainsaying four such masterful 
travellers, all armed, and two of them uncommonly large and strong -looking. 
Frodo ordered the gates to be locked again. There was some sense at any rate 
in keeping a guard, while ruffians were still about. Then the four 
companions went into the hobbit guard-house and made themselves as 
comfortable as they could. It was a bare and ugly place, with a mean little 
grate that would not allow a good fire. In the upper rooms were little rows 
of hard beds, and on every wall there was a notice and a list of Rules. 
Pippin tore them down. There was no beer and very little food, but with what 
the travellers brought and shared out they all made a fair meal; and Pippin 
broke Rule 4 by putting most of next day's allowance of wood on the fire. 

'Well now, what about a smoke, while you tell us what has been 
happening in the Shire?' he said. 

'There isn't no pipe-weed now,' said Hob; 'at least only for the 
Chiefs men. All the stocks seem to have gone. We do hear that waggon-loads 
of it went away down the old road out of the Southfarthing, over Sarn Ford 
way. That would be the end o' last year, after you left. But it had been 
going away quietly before that, in a small way. That Lotho— ' 

'Now you shut up, Hob Hayward!' cried several of the others. 'You know 
talk o' that sort isn't allowed. The Chief will hear of it, and we'll all be 
in trouble.' 

'He wouldn't hear naught, if some of you here weren't sneaks,' rejoined 
Hob hotly. 

'All right, all right!' said Sam. "That's quite enough. I don't want to 
hear no more. No welcome, no beer, no smoke, and a lot of rules and ore-talk 
instead. I hoped to have a rest, but I can see there's work and trouble 
ahead. Let's sleep and forget it till morning!' 




The new ’Chief evidently had means of getting news. It was a good 
forty miles from the Bridge to Bag End, but someone made the journey in a 
hurry. So Frodo and his friends soon discovered. 

They had not made any definite plans, but had vaguely thought of going 
down to Crickhollow together first, and resting there a bit. But now, seeing 
what things were like, they decided to go straight to Hobbiton. So the next 
day they set out along the Road and jogged along steadily. The wind had 
dropped but the sky was grey. The land looked rather sad and forlorn; but it 
was after all the first of November and the fag-end of Autumn. Still there 
seemed an unusual amount of burning going on, and smoke rose from many 
points round about. A great cloud of it was going up far away in the 
direction of the Woody End. 

As evening fell they were drawing near to Frogmorton, a village right 
on the Road, about twenty -two miles from the Bridge. There they meant to 
stay the night; The Floating Log at Frogmorton was a good inn. But as they 
came to the east end of the village they met a barrier with a large board 
saying NO ROAD; and behind it stood a large band of Shirriffs with staves in 
their hands and feathers in their caps, looking both important and rather 
scared. 

’What's all this?' said Frodo, feeling inclined to laugh. 

This is what it is, Mr. Baggins, said the leader of the Shirriffs, a 
two-feather hobbit: 'You're arrested for Gate-breaking, and Tearing up of 
Rules, and Assaulting Gate-keepers, and Trespassing, and Sleeping in 
Shire-buildings without Feave, and Bribing Guards with Food.' 

'And what else?' said Frodo. 

'That'll do to go on with,' said the Shirriff-leader. 

'I can add some more, if you like it,' said Sam. 'Calling your Chief 
Names, Wishing to punch his Pimply Face, and Thinking you Shirriffs look a 
lot of Tom-fools.' 

'There now, Mister, that'll do. It's the Chiefs orders that you're to 
come along quiet. We're going to take you to Bywater and hand you over to 
the Chiefs Men; and when he deals with your case you can have your say. But 
if you don't want to stay in the Fockholes any longer than you need, I 
should cut the say short, if I was you.' 

To the discomfiture of the Shirriffs Frodo and his companions all 
roared with laughter. 'Don't be absurd!' said Frodo. 'I am going where I 
please, and in my own time. I happen to be going to Bag End on business, but 




if you insist on going too, well that is your affair.' 

'Very well, Mr. Baggins,' said the leader, pushing the barrier aside. 

'But don't forget I've arrested you.' 

'I won't,' said Frodo. 'Never. But I may forgive you. Now I am not 
going any further today, so if you'll kindly escort me to The Floating Log , 

I'll be obliged.' 

'I can't do that, Mr. Baggins. The inn's closed. There's a 
Shirriff-house at the far end of the village. I'll take you there. ' 

'All right,' said Frodo. 'Go on and we'll follow.' 

Sam had been looking the Shirriffs up and down and had spotted one that 
he knew. 'Hey, come here Robin Smallburrow!' he called. 'I want a word with 
you.' 

With a sheepish glance at his leader, who looked wrathful but did not 
dare to interfere, Shirriff Smallburrow fell back and walked beside Sam, who 
got down off his pony. 

'Look here, Cock-robin!' said Sam. 'You're Hobbiton-bred and ought to 
have more sense, coming a-waylaying Mr. Frodo and all. And what's all this 
about the inn being closed?' 

'They're all closed,' said Robin. 'The Chief doesn't hold with beer. 
Leastways that is how it started. But now I reckon it's his Men that has it 
all. And he doesn't hold with folk moving about; so if they will or they 
must, then they has to go to the Shirriff-house and explain their business.' 

'You ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such 
nonsense,' said Sam. 'You used to like the inside of an inn better than the 
outside yourself. You were always popping in, on duty or off.' 

'And so I would be still, Sam, if I could. But don't be hard on me. 

What can I do? You know how I went for a Shirriff seven years ago, before 
any of this began. Gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing 
folk, and hearing the news, and knowing where the good beer was. But now 
it's different.' 

'But you can give it up, stop Shirriffing, if it has stopped being a 
respectable job,' said Sam. 

'We're not allowed to,' said Robin. 

'If I hear not allowed much oftener,' said Sam, 'I'm going to get 
angry.' 

'Can't say as I'd be sorry to see it,' said Robin lowering his voice. 

'If we all got angry together something might be done. But it's these Men, 




Sam, the Chiefs Men. He sends them round everywhere, and if any of us small 
folk stand up for our rights, they drag him off to the Lockholes. They took 
old Flourdumpling, old Will Whitfoot the Mayor, first, and they’ve taken a 
lot more. Lately it's been getting worse. Often they beat ’em now.' 

'Then why do you do their work far them?' said Sam angrily. 'Who sent 
you to Frogmorton?' 

'No one did. We stay here in the big Shirriff-house. We're the First 
Eastfarthing Troop now. There's hundreds of Shirriffs all told and they want 
more, with all these new rules. Most of them are in it against their will, 
but not all. Even in the Shire there are some as like minding other folk's 
business and talking big. And there's worse than that: there's a few as do 
spy-work for the Chief and his Men.' 

'Ah! So that's how you had news of us, is it?' 

'That's right. We aren't allowed to send by it now, but they use the 
old Quick Post service, and keep special runners at different points. One 
came in from Whitfurrows last night with a "secret message", and another 
took it on from here. And a message came back this afternoon saying you was 
to be arrested and taken to By water, not direct to the Lockholes. The Chief 
wants to see you at once, evidently.' 

'He won't be so eager when Mr. Frodo has finished with him,' said Sam. 

The Shirriff-house at Frogmorton was as bad as the Bridge-house. It had 
only one storey, but it had the same narrow windows, and it was built of 
ugly pale bricks, badly laid. Inside it was damp and cheerless, and supper 
was served on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks. The 
food deserved no better setting. The travellers were glad to leave the 
place. It was about eighteen miles to Bywater, and they set off at ten 
o'clock in the morning. They would have started earlier, only the delay so 
plainly annoyed the Shirriff-leader. The west wind had shifted northward and 
it was turning colder, but the rain was gone. 

It was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the few 
folk that came out to stare at the 'get-up' of the travellers did not seem 
quite sure whether laughing was allowed. A dozen Shirriffs had been told off 
as escort to the 'prisoners'; but Merry made them march in front, while 
Frodo and his friends rode behind. Merry, Pippin, and Sam sat at their ease 
laughing and talking and singing, while the Shirriffs stumped along trying 
to look stern and important. Frodo, however, was silent and looked rather 
sad and thoughtful. 




The last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge. 
'Hullo, hullo!' he jeered. 'Now who's arrested who?' 

Two of the Shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards him. 
'Leader!' said Merry. 'Order your fellows back to their places at once, if 
you don't want me to deal with them!' 

The two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily. 'Now 
get on!' said Merry, and after that the travellers saw to it that their 
ponies' pace was quick enough to push the Shirriffs along as fast as they 
could go. The sun came out, and in spite of the chilly wind they were soon 
puffing and sweating. 

At the Three-Farthing Stone they gave it up. They had done nearly 
fourteen miles with only one rest at noon. It was now three o'clock. They 
were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace. 

'Well, come along in your own time!' said Merry. 'We are going on.' 

'Good-bye, Cock-robin!' said Sam. 'I'll wait for you outside The Green 
Dragon , if you haven't forgotten where that is. Don't dawdle on the way!' 

'You're breaking arrest, that's what you're doing,' said the leader 
ruefully, 'and I can't be answerable.' 

'We shall break a good many things yet, and not ask you to answer ' 
said Pippin. 'Good luck to you!' 

The travellers trotted on, and as the sun began to sink towards the 
White Downs far away on the western horizon they came to Bywater by its 
wide 

pool; and there they had their first really painful shock. This was Frodo 
and Sam's own country, and they found out now that they cared about it more 
than any other place in the world. Many of the houses that they had known 
were missing. Some seemed to have been burned down. The pleasant row of 
old 

hobbit-holes in the bank on the north side of the Pool were deserted, and 
their little gardens that used to run down bright to the water's edge were 
rank with weeds. Worse, there was a whole line of the ugly new houses all 
along Pool Side, where the Hobbiton Road ran close to the bank. An avenue of 
trees had stood there. They were all gone. And looking with dismay up the 
road towards Bag End they saw a tallchimneyofbrickinthedistance.lt 
was pouring out black smoke into the evening air. 

Sam was beside himself. 'I'm going right on, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I'm 
going to see what's up. I want to find my gaffer.' 




'We ought to find out first what we're in for, Sam,' said Merry. 'I 
guess that the "Chief" will have a gang of ruffians handy. We had better 
find someone who will tell us how things are round here.' 

But in the village of By water all the houses and holes were shut, and 
no one greeted them. They wondered at this, but they soon discovered the 
reason of it. When they reached The Green Dragon, the last house on the 
Hobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken windows, they were disturbed to 
see half a dozen large ill-favoured Men lounging against the inn-wall; they 
were squint-eyed and sallow-faced. 

'Like that friend of Bill Ferny's at Bree,' said Sam. 

'Like many that I saw at Isengard,' muttered Merry. 

The ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts, but 
they had no other weapons, as far as could be seen. As the travellers rode 
up they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way. 

'Where d'you think you're going?' said one, the largest and most 
evil-looking of the crew. 'There's no road for you any further. And where 
are those precious Shirriffs?' 

'Coming along nicely,' said Merry. 'A little footsore, perhaps. We 
promised to wait for them here.' 

'Garn, what did I say?' said the ruffian to his mates. 'I told Sharkey 
it was no good trusting those little fools. Some of our chaps ought to have 
been sent.' 

'And what difference would that have made, pray?' said Merry. 'We are 
not used to footpads in this country, but we know how to deal with them.' 

'Footpads, eh?' said the man: 'So that's your tone, is it? Change it, 
or we'll change it for you. You little folk are getting too uppish. Don't 
you trust too much in the Boss's kind heart. Sharkey's come now and he'll do 
what Sharkey says.' 

'And what may that be?' said Frodo quietly. 

'This country wants waking up and setting to rights,' said the ruffian, 

'and Sharkey's going to do it; and make it hard, if you drive him to it. You 
need a bigger Boss. And you'll get one before the year is out, if there's 
any more trouble. Then you'll learn a thing or two, you little rat-folk.' 

'Indeed. I am glad to hear of your plans,' said Frodo. 'I am on my way 
to call on Mr. Lotho, and he may be interested to hear of them too.' 

The ruffian laughed. 'Lotho! He knows all right. Don't you worry. He'll 
do what Sharkey says. Because if a Boss gives trouble, we can change him. 




See? And if little folks try to push in where they’re not wanted, we can put 
them out of mischief. See?' 

’Yes, I see,' said Frodo. ’For one thing, I see that you're behind the 
times and the news here. Much has happened since you left the South. Your 
day is over, and all other ruffians'. The Dark Tower has fallen, and there 
is a King in Gondor. And Isengard has been destroyed, and your precious 
master is a beggar in the wilderness. I passed him on the road. The King’s 
messengers will ride up the Greenway now not bullies from Isengard.' 

The man stared at him and smiled. 'A beggar in the wilderness!' he 
mocked. 'Oh, is he indeed? Swagger it, swagger it, my little cock-a-whoop. 
But that won't stop us living in this fat little country where you have 
lazed long enough. And' - he snapped his fingers in Frodo's face - 'King's 
messengers! That for them! When I see one, I'll take notice, perhaps.' 

This was too much for Pippin. His thoughts went back to the Field of 
Cormallen, and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the Ring-bearer 'little 
cock-a-whoop'. He cast back his cloak, flashed out his sword, and the silver 
and sable of Gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward. 

'I am a messenger of the King,' he said. 'You are speaking to the 
King's friend, and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the West. 
You are a ruffian and a fool. Down on your knees in the road and ask pardon, 
or I will set this troll's bane in you!' 

The sword glinted in the westering sun. Merry and Sam drew their swords 
also and rode up to support Pippin; but Frodo did not move. The ruffians 
gave back. Scaring Breeland peasants, and bullying bewildered hobbits, had 
been their work. Fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a 
great surprise. And there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that 
they had not heard before. It chilled them with fear. 

'Go!' said Merry. 'If you trouble this village again, you will regret 
it.' The three hobbits came on, and then the ruffians turned and fled 
running away up the Hobbiton Road; but they blew their horns as they ran. 

'Well, we've come back none too soon,' said Merry. 

'Not a day too soon. Perhaps too late, at any rate to save Lotho,' said 
Frodo. 'Miserable fool, but I am sorry for him.' 

'Save Lotho? Whatever do you mean?' said Pippin. 'Destroy him I should 
say.' 

'I don't think you quite understand things, Pippin,' said Frodo. 'Lotho 
never meant things to come to this pass. He has been a wicked fool, but he's 




caught now. The ruffians are on top, gathering, robbing and bullying, and 
running or ruining things as they like, in his name. And not in his name 
even for much longer. He's a prisoner in Bag End now, I expect, and very 
frightened. We ought to try and rescue him.' 

'Weill am staggered!' said Pippin. 'Of all the ends to our journey 
that is the very last I should have thought of: to have to fight half-ores 
and ruffians in the Shire itself - to rescue Lotho Pimple!' 

'Fight?' said Frodo. 'Well, I suppose it may come to that. But 
remember: there is to be no slaying of hobbits, not even if they have gone 
over to the other side. Really gone over, I mean; not just obeying ruffians' 
orders because they are frightened. No hobbit has ever killed another on 
purpose in the Shire, and it is not to begin now. And nobody is to be killed 
at all, if it can be helped. Keep your tempers and hold your hands to the 
last possible moment!' 

'But if there are many of these ruffians,' said Merry, 'it will 
certainly mean fighting. You won't rescue Fotho, or the Shire, just by being 
shocked and sad, my dear Frodo.' 

'No,' said Pippin. 'It won't be so easy scaring them a second time. 

They were taken by surprise. You heard that horn-blowing? Evidently there 
are other ruffians near at hand. They'll be much bolder when there's more of 
them together. We ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night. 
After all we're only four, even if we are armed.' 

'I've an idea,' said Sam. 'Fet's go to old Tom Cotton's down South 
Fane! He always was a stout fellow. And he has a lot of lads that were all 
friends of mine.' 

'No!' said Merry. 'It's no good "getting under cover". That is just 
what people have been doing, and just what these ruffians like. They will 
simply come down on us in force, corner us, and then drive us out, or burn 
us in. No, we have got to do something at once.' 

'Do what?' said Pippin. 

'Raise the Shire!' said Merry. 'Now! Wake all our people! They hate all 
this, you can see: all of them except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few 
fools that want to be important, but don't at all understand what is really 
going on. But Shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don't know 
what to do. They just want a match, though, and they'll go up in fire. The 
Chiefs Men must know that. They'll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. 
We've only got a very short time. 




’Sam, you can make a dash for Cotton's farm, if you like. He’s the 
chief person round here, and the sturdiest. Come on! I am going to blow the 
horn of Rohan, and give them all some music they have never heard before.' 

They rode back to the middle of the village. There Sam turned aside and 
galloped off down the lane that led south to Cotton’s. He had not gone far 
when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing into the sky. Far over 
hill and field it echoed; and so compelling was that call that Sam himself 
almost turned and dashed back. His pony reared and neighed. 

'On, lad! On!' he cried. 'We'll be going back soon.' 

Then he heard Merry change the note, and up went the Horn-cry of 
Buckland, shaking the air. 

Awake! Awake! Fear, Fire, Foes! Awake! 

Fire, Foes! Awake! 

Behind him Sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of 
doors. In front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming; dogs barked; feet 
came running. Before he got to the lane's end there was Farmer Cotton with 
three of his lads, Young Tom, Jolly, and Nick, hurrying towards him. They 
had axes in their hands, and barred the way. 

'Nay! It's not one of them ruffians,' Sam heard the farmer say. 'It's a 
hobbit by the size of it, but all dressed up queer. Hey!' he cried. 'Who are 
you, and what's all this to-do?' 

'It's Sam, Sam Gamgee. I've come back.' 

Farmer Cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight. 'Well!' 
he exclaimed. 'The voice is right, and your face is no worse than it was, 

Sam. But I should a' passed you in the street in that gear. You've been in 
foreign parts, seemingly. We feared you were dead.' 

'That I ain't!' said Sam. 'Nor Mr. Frodo. He's here and his friends. 

And that's the to-do. They're raising the Shire. We're going to clear out 
these ruffians, and their Chief too. We're starting now.' 

'Good, good!' cried Farmer Cotton. 'So it's begun at last! I've been 
itching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn't help. And I've had the 
wife and Rosie to think of. These ruffians don't stick at nothing. But come 
on now, lads! By water is up! We must be in it!' 

'What about Mrs. Cotton and Rosie?' said Sam. 'It isn't safe yet for 
them to be left all alone.' 

'My Nibs is with them. But you can go and help him, if you have a 
mind,' said Farmer Cotton with a grin. Then he and his sons ran off towards 




the village. 

Sam hurried to the house. By the large round door at the top of the 
steps from the wide yard stood Mrs. Cotton and Rosie, and Nibs in front of 
them grasping a hay-fork. 

'It's me!' shouted Sam as he trotted up. ’Sam Gamgee! So don’t try 
prodding me, Nibs. Anyway, I've a mail-shirt on me.' 

He jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. They stared at him 
in silence. 'Good evening, Mrs. Cotton!' he said. 'Hullo Rosie!' 

'Hullo, Sam!' said Rosie. 'Where've you been I They said you were dead; 
but I've been expecting you since the Spring. You haven't hurried have you?' 

'Perhaps not,' said Sam abashed. 'But I'm hurrying now. We're setting 
about the ruffians, and I've got to get back to Mr. Frodo. But I thought I'd 
have a look and see how Mrs. Cotton was keeping, and you, Rosie.' 

'We're keeping nicely, thank you,' said Mrs. Cotton. 'Or should be, if 
it weren't for these thieving ruffians.' 

'Well, be off with you!' said Rosie. 'If you've been looking after Mr. 

Frodo all this while, what d'you want to leave him for, as soon as things 
look dangerous?' 

This was too much for Sam. It needed a week's answer, or none. He 
turned away and mounted his pony. But as he started off, Rosie ran down the 
steps. 

'I think you look fine, Sam,' she said. 'Go on now! But take care of 
yourself, and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians!' 

When Sam got back he found the whole village roused. Already, apart 
from many younger lads, more than a hundred sturdy hobbits were assembled 
with axes, and heavy hammers, and long knives, and stout staves: and a few 
had hunting-bows. More were still coming in from outlying farms. 

Some of the village-folk had lit a large fire, just to enliven things, 
and also because it was one of the things forbidden by the Chief. It burned 
bright as night came on. Others at Merry's orders were setting up barriers 
across the road at each end of the village. When the Shirriffs came up to 
the lower one they were dumbfounded; but as soon as they saw how things 
were, most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt. The 
others slunk away. 

Sam found Frodo and his friends by the fire talking to old Tom Cotton, 
while an admiring crowd of Bywater folk stood round and stared. 

'Well, what's the next move?' said Farmer Cotton. 




'I can't say,' said Frodo, 'until I know more. How many of these 
ruffians are there?' 

'That's hard to tell,' said Cotton. 'They moves about and comes and 
goes. There's sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up Hobbiton way; but 
they go out from there roving round, thieving or "gathering" as they call 
it. Still there's seldom less than a score round the Boss, as they names 
him. He's at Bag End, or was; but he don't go outside the rounds now. No one 
s seen him at all, in fact, for a week or two; but the Men don't let no one 
go near.' 

'Hobbiton's not their only place, is it?' said Pippin. 

'No, more's the pity,' said Cotton. 'There's a good few down south in 
Longbottom and by Sarn Ford, I hear; and some more lurking in the Woody 
End; 

and they've sheds at Waymeet. And then there's the Lockholes, as they call 
'em: the old storage -tunnels at Michel Delving that they've made into 
prisons for those as stand up to them. Still I reckon there's not above 
three hundred of them in the Shire all told, and maybe less. We can master 
them, if we stick together.' 

'Have they got any weapons?' asked Merry. 

'Whips, knives, and clubs, enough for their dirty work: that's all 
they've showed so far,' said Cotton. 'But I dare say they've got other gear, 
if it comes to fighting. Some have bows, anyway. They've shot one or two of 
our folk.' 

'There you are, Frodo!' said Merry. 'I knew we should have to fight. 

Well, they started the killing.' 

'Not exactly,' said Cotton. 'Leastways not the shooting. Tooks started 
that. You see our dad Mr. Peregrin, he's never had no truck with this Lotho, 
not from the beginning: said that if anyone was going to play the chief at 
this time of day, it would be the right Thain of the Shire and no upstart. 

And when Lotho sent his Men they got no change out of him. Tooks are lucky, 
they've got those deep holes in the Green Hills, the Great Smials and all, 
and the ruffians can't come at 'em; and they won't let the ruffians come on 
their land. If they do, Tooks hunt 'em. Tooks shot three for prowling and 
robbing. After that the ruffians turned nastier. And they keep a pretty 
close watch on Tookland. No one gets in nor out of it now.' 

'Good for the Tooks!' cried Pippin. 'But someone is going to get in 
again, now. I am off to the Smials. Anyone coming with me to Tuckborough?' 




Pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies. ’See you soon!' he 
cried. 'It's only fourteen miles or so over the fields. I'll bring you back 
an army of Tooks in the morning.' Merry blew a horn-call after them as they 
rode off into the gathering night. The people cheered. 

'All the same,' said Frodo to all those who stood near, 'I wish for no 
killing; not even of the ruffians, unless it must be done, to prevent them 
from hurting hobbits.' 

'All right!' said Merry. 'But we shall be having a visit from the 
Hobbiton gang any time now, I think. They won't come just to talk things 
over. We'll try to deal with them neatly, but we must be prepared for the 
worst. Now I've got a plan.' 

'Very good,' said Frodo. 'You make the arrangements.' 

Just then some hobbits, who had been sent out towards Hobbiton, came 
running in. 'They're coming!' they said. 'A score or more. But two have gone 
off west across country.' 

'To Waymeet, that'll be,' said Cotton, 'to fetch more of the gang. 

Well, it's fifteen mile each way. We needn't trouble about them just yet.' 

Merry hurried off to give orders. Farmer Cotton cleared the street, 
sending everyone indoors, except the older hobbits who had weapons of some 
sort. They had not long to wait. Soon they could hear loud voices, and then 
the tramping of heavy feet. Presently a whole squad of the ruffians came 
down the road. They saw the barrier and laughed. They did not imagine that 
there was anything in this little land that would stand up to twenty of 
their kind together. 

The hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside. 'Thank you!' the Men 
jeered. 'Now run home to bed before you're whipped.' Then they marched along 
the street shouting: 'Put those lights out! Get indoors and stay there! Or 
we'll take fifty of you to the Lockholes for a year. Get in! The Boss is 
losing his temper.' 

No one paid any heed to their orders; but as the ruffians passed, they 
closed in quietly behind and followed them. When the Men reached the fire 
there was Farmer Cotton standing all alone warming his hands. 

'Who are you, and what d'you think you're doing?' said the 
ruffian-leader. 

Farmer Cotton looked at him slowly. 'I was just going to ask you that,' 
he said. 'This isn't your country, and you're not wanted.' 

'Well, you're wanted anyhow,' said the leader. 'We want you. Take him 




lads! Lockholes for him, and give him something to keep him quiet!' 

The Men took one step forward and stopped short. There rose a roar of 
voices all round them, and suddenly they were aware that Farmer Cotton was 
not all alone. They were surrounded. In the dark on the edge of the 
firelight stood a ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows. 

There was nearly two hundred of them, all holding some weapon. 

Merry stepped forward. 'We have met before,' he said to the leader, 

'and I warned you not to come back here. I warn you again: you are standing 
in the light and you are covered by archers. If you lay a finger on this 
farmer, or on anyone else, you will be shot at once. Lay down any weapons 
that you have!' 

The leader looked round. He was trapped. But he was not scared, not now 
with a score of his fellows to back him. He knew too little of hobbits to 
understand his peril. Foolishly he decided to fight. It would be easy to 
break out. 

'At 'em lads!' he cried. 'Let 'em have it!' 

With a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made a 
rush at the ring, trying to burst out back towards Hobbiton. He aimed a 
savage blow at Merry who stood in his way. He fell dead with four arrows in 
him: 

That was enough for the others. They gave in. Their weapons were taken 
from them, and they were roped together, and marched off to an empty hut 
that they had built themselves, and there they were tied hand and foot, and 
locked up under guard. The dead leader was dragged off and buried. 

'Seems almost too easy after all, don't it?' said Cotton. 'I said we 
could master them. But we needed a call. You came back in the nick o' time, 
Mr. Merry.' 

'There's more to be done still,' said Merry. 'If you're right in your 
reckoning, we haven't dealt with a tithe of them yet. But it's dark now. I 
think the next stroke must wait until morning. Then we must call on the 
Chief.' 

'Why not now?' said Sam. 'It's not much more than six o'clock. And I 
want to see my gaffer. D'you know what's come of him, Mr. Cotton?' 

'He's not too well, and not too bad, Sam,' said the farmer. 'They dug 
up Bagshot Row, and that was a sad blow to him. He's in one of them new 
houses that the Chiefs Men used to build while they still did any work 
other than burning and thieving: not above a mile from the end of By water. 




But he comes around to me, when he gets a chance, and I see he's better fed 
than some of the poor bodies. All against The Rules, of course. I'd have had 
him with me, but that wasn't allowed.’ 

'Thank'ee indeed, Mr. Cotton, and I'll never forget it,' said Sam. 'But 
I want to see him. That Boss and that Sharkey, as they spoke of, they might 
do a mischief up there before the morning.' 

'All right, Sam,' said Cotton. 'Choose a lad or two, and go and fetch 
him to my house. You'll not have need to go near the old Hobbiton village 
over Water. My Jolly here will show you.' 

Sam went off. Merry arranged for look-outs round the village and guards 
at the barriers during the night. Then he and Frodo went off with Farmer 
Cotton. They sat with the family in the warm kitchen, and the Cottons asked 
a few polite questions about their travels, but hardly listened to the 
answers: they were far more concerned with events in the Shire. 

'It all began with Pimple, as we call him,' said Farmer Cotton; 'and it 
began as soon as you'd gone off, Mr. Frodo. He'd funny ideas had Pimple. 
Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and then order other folk about. 

It soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him; 
and he was always grabbing more, though where he got the money was a 
mystery: mills and malt-houses and inns, and farms, and leaf-plantations. 

He'd already bought Sandyman's mill before he came to Bag End, seemingly. 

'Of course he started with a lot of property in the Southfarthing which 
he had from his dad; and it seems he'd been selling a lot o' the best leaf, 
and sending it away quietly for a year or two. But at the end o' last year 
he began sending away loads of stuff, not only leaf. Things began to get 
short, and winter coming on, too. Folk got angry, but he had his answer. A 
lot of Men, ruffians mostly, came with great waggons, some to carry off the 
goods south-away, and others to stay. And more came. And before we knew 
where we were they were planted here and there all over the Shire, and were 
felling trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as 
they liked. At first goods and damage was paid for by Pimple; but soon they 
began lording it around and taking what they wanted. 

'Then there was a bit of trouble, but not enough. Old Will the Mayor 
set off for Bag End to protest, but he never got there. Ruffians laid hands 
on him and took and locked him up in a hole in Michel Delving, and there he 
is now. And after that, it would be soon after New Year, there wasn't no 
more Mayor, and Pimple called himself Chief Shirriff, or just Chief, and did 




as he liked; and if anyone got "uppish" as they called it, they followed 
Will. So things went from bad to worse. There wasn't no smoke left, save for 
the Men; and the Chief didn't hold with beer, save for his Men, and closed 
all the inns; and everything except Rules got shorter and shorter, unless 
one could hide a bit of one's own when the ruffians went round gathering 
stuff up "for fair distribution": which meant they got it and we didn't, 
except for the leavings which you could have at the Shirriff-houses, if you 
could stomach them. All very bad. But since Sharkey came it's been plain 
ruination.' 

'Who is this Sharkey?' said Merry. 'I heard one of the ruffians speak 
of him.' 

'The biggest ruffian o' the lot, seemingly,' answered Cotton. 'It was 
about last harvest, end o' September maybe, that we first heard of him. 
We've never seen him, but he's up at Bag End; and he's the real Chief now, I 
guess. All the ruffians do what he says; and what he says is mostly hack, 
burn, and ruin; and now it s come to killing. There s no longer even any bad 
sense in it. They cut down trees and let 'em lie, they burn houses and build 
no more. 

'Take Sandyman's mill now. Pimple knocked it down almost as soon as he 
came to Bag End. Then he brought in a lot o' dirty -looking Men to build a 
bigger one and fill it full o' wheels and outlandish contraptions. Only that 
fool Ted was pleased by that, and he works there cleaning wheels for the 
Men, where his dad was the Miller and his own master. Pimple's idea was to 
grind more and faster, or so he said. He's got other mills like it. But 
you've got to have grist before you can grind; and there was no more for the 
new mill to do than for the old. But since Sharkey came they don't grind no 
more corn at all. They're always a-hammering and a-letting out a smoke and a 
stench, and there isn't no peace even at night in Hobbiton. And they pour 
out filth a purpose; they've fouled all the lower Water and it's getting 
down into Brandywine. If they want to make the Shire into a desert, they're 
going the right way about it. I don't believe that fool of a Pimple's behind 
all this. It's Sharkey, I say.' 

'That's right!' put in Young Tom. 'Why, they even took Pimple's old ma, 
that Lobelia, and he was fond of her, if no one else was. Some of the 
Hobbiton folk, they saw it. She comes down the lane with her old umbrella. 
Some of the ruffians were going up with a big cart. 

' "Where be you a-going?" says she. 




' "To Bag End," says they. 

' "What for?" says she. 

' "To put up some sheds for Sharkey," says they. 

' "Who said you could?" says she. 

' "Sharkey," says they. "So get out o' the road, old hagling!" 

' "I'll give you Sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!" says she, and 
ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader, near twice her size. So they 
took her. Dragged her off to the Lockholes, at her age too. They’ve took 
others we miss more, but there's no denying she showed more spirit than 
most.' 

Into the middle of this talk came Sam, bursting in with his gaffer. Old 
Gamgee did not look much older, but he was a little deafer. 

'Good evening. Mr. Baggins!' he said. 'Glad indeed I am to see you safe 
back. But I've a bone to pick with you, in a manner o' speaking, if I may 
make so bold. You didn't never ought to have a' sold Bag End, as I always 
said. That's what started all the mischief. And while you're been trapessing 
in foreign parts, chasing Black Men up mountains from what my Sam says, 
though what for he don't make clear, they've been and dug up Bagshot Row and 
ruined my taters!' 

'I am very sorry, Mr. Gamgee,' said Frodo. 'But now I've come back, 

I'll do my best to make amends.' 

'Well, you can't say fairer than that,' said the gaffer. 'Mr. Frodo 
Baggins is a real gentlehobbit, I always have said, whatever you may think 
of some others of the name, begging your pardon. And I hope my Sam's 
behaved 

hisself and given satisfaction?' 

'Perfect satisfaction, Mr. Gamgee,' said Frodo. 'Indeed, if you will 
believe it, he's now one of the most famous people in all the lands, and 
they are making songs about his deeds from here to the Sea and beyond the 
Great River.' Sam blushed, but he looked gratefully at Frodo, for Rosie's 
eyes were shining and she was smiling at him. 

'It takes a lot o' believing,' said the gaffer, 'though I can see he's 
been mixing in strange company. What's come of his weskit? I don't hold with 
wearing ironmongery, whether it wears well or no.' 

Farmer Cotton's household and all his guests were up early next 
morning. Nothing had been heard in the night, but more trouble would 
certainly come before the day was old. 'Seems as if none o' the ruffians 




were left up at Bag End,' said Cotton; 'but the gang from Waymeet will be 
along any time now.' 

After breakfast a messenger from the Tookland rode in. He was in high 
spirits. 'The Thain has raised all our country,' he said, 'and the news is 
going like fire all ways. The ruffians that were watching our land have fled 
off south, those that escaped alive. The Thain has gone after them, to hold 
off the big gang down that way; but he's sent Mr Peregrin back with all the 
other folk he can spare.' 

The next news was less good. Merry, who had been out all night, came 
riding in about ten o'clock. 'There's a big band about four miles away,' he 
said. 'They're coming along the road from Waymeet, but a good many stray 
ruffians have joined up with them. There must be close on a hundred of them; 
and they're fire-raising as they come. Curse them!' 

'Ah! This lot won't stay to talk, they'll kill, if they can,' said 
Farmer Cotton. 'If Tooks don't come sooner, we'd best get behind cover and 
shoot without arguing. There's got to be some fighting before this is 
settled, Mr. Frodo.' 

The Tooks did come sooner. Before long they marched in, a hundred 
strong, from Tuckborough and the Green Hills with Pippin at their head. 
Merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians. Scouts 
reported that they were keeping close together. They knew that the 
countryside had risen against them, and plainly meant to deal with the 
rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in Bywater. But however grim they, might 
be, they seemed to have no leader among them who understood warfare. 
They 

came on without any precautions. Merry laid his plans quickly. 

The ruffians came tramping along the East Road, and without halting 
turned up the Bywater Road, which ran for some way sloping up between 
high 

banks with low hedges on top. Round a bend, about a furlong from the main 
road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them. 

At the same moment they became aware that the hedges on both sides, just 
above their heads, were all lined with hobbits. Behind them other hobbits 
now pushed out some more waggons that had been hidden in a field, and so 
blocked the way back. A voice spoke to them from above. 

'Well, you have walked into a trap,' said Merry. 'Your fellows from 
Hobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the rest are prisoners. Fay down 




your weapons ! Then go back twenty paces and sit down. Any who try to 
break 

out will be shot.' 

But the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily. A few of them 
obeyed, but were immediately set on by their fellows. A score or more broke 
back and charged the waggons. Six were shot, but the remainder burst out, 
killing two hobbits, and then scattering across country in the direction of 
the Woody End. Two more fell as they ran. Merry blew a loud horn-call, and 
there were answering calls from a distance. 

'They won't get far,' said Pippin. 'All that country is alive with our 
hunters now.' 

Behind, the trapped Men in the lane, still about four score, tried to 
climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many 
of them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest and most desperate 
got out on the west side, and attacked their enemies fiercely, being now 
more bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were 
wavering, when Merry and Pippin, who were on the east side, came across and 
charged the ruffians. Merry himself slew the leader, a great squint-eyed 
brute like a huge ore. Then he drew his forces off, encircling the last 
remnant of the Men in a wide ring of archers. 

At last all was over. Nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the 
field, and a dozen were prisoners. Nineteen hobbits were killed, and some 
thirty were wounded. The dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off 
to an old sand-pit nearby and there buried: in the Battle Pit, as it was 
afterwards called. The fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on the 
hill-side, where later a great stone was set up with a garden about it. So 
ended the Battle of By water, 1419, the last battle fought in the Shire, and 
the only battle since the Greenfields, 1147, away up in the Northfarthing. 

In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to 
itself in the Red Book, and the names of all those who took part were made 
into a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable 
rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the 
top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains Meriadoc and 
Peregrin. 

Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief 
part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from 
slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. When the 




fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and 
Sam joined him, and they rode back with the Cottons. They ate a late midday 
meal, and then Frodo said with a sigh: 'Well, I suppose it is time now that 
we dealt with the "Chief".' 

'Yes indeed; the sooner the better,' said Merry. 'And don't be too 
gentle! He's responsible for bringing in these ruffians, and for all the 
evil they have done.' 

Farmer Cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits. 

'For it's only a guess that there is no ruffians left at Bag End,' he said. 

'We don't know.' Then they set out on foot. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin 
led the way. 

It was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney rose 
up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, 
through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the 
new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building 
straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking 
overflow. All along the By water Road every tree had been felled. 

As they crossed the bridge and looked up the Hill they gasped. Even 
Sam's vision in the Mirror had not prepared him for what they saw. The Old 
Grange on the west side had been knocked down, and its place taken by rows 
of tarred sheds. All the chestnuts were gone. The banks and hedgerows were 
broken. Great waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of 
grass. Bagshot Row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry. Bag End up. 
beyond 

could not be seen for a clutter of large huts. 

'They've cut it down!' cried Sam. 'They've cut down the Party Tree!' He 
pointed to where the tree, had stood under which Bilbo had made his Farewell 
Speech. It was lying lopped and dead in the field. As if this was the last 
straw Sam burst into tears. 

A laugh put an end to them. There was a surly hobbit lounging over the 
low wall of the mill-yard. He was grimy -faced and black-handed. 'Don't 'ee 
like it, Sam?' he sneered. 'But you always was soft. I thought you'd gone 
off in one o' them ships you used to prattle about, sailing, sailing. What 
d'you want to come back for? We've work to do in the Shire now.' 

'So I see,' said Sam. 'No time for washing, but time for wall -propping. 

But see here, Master Sandy man, I've a score to pay in this village, and 
don't you make it any longer with your jeering, or you'll foot a bill too 




big for your purse.’ 

Ted Sandyman spat over the wall: 'Garn!' he said. 'You can’t touch me. 

I'm a friend o' the Boss's. But he'll touch you all right, if I have any 
more of your mouth.' 

'Don't waste any more words on the fool, Sam!' said Frodo. 'I hope 
there are not many more hobbits that have become like this. It would be a 
worse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.' 

'You are dirty and insolent, Sandyman,' said Merry. 'And also very much 
out of your reckoning. We are just going up the Hill to remove your precious 
Boss. We have dealt with his Men.' 

Ted gaped, for at that moment he first caught sight of the escort that 
at a sign from Merry now marched over the bridge. Dashing back into the mill 
he ran out with a horn and blew it loudly. 

'Save your breath!' laughed Merry. 'I've a better.' Then lifting up his 
silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang over the Hill; and out of 
the holes and sheds and shabby houses of Hobbiton the hobbits answered, and 
came pouring out, and with cheers and loud cries they followed the company 
up the road to Bag End. 

At the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends went 
on; and they came at last to the once beloved place. The garden was full of 
huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all 
their light. There were piles of refuse everywhere. The door was scarred; 
the bell-chain was dangling loose, and the bell would not ring. Knocking 
brought no answer. At length they pushed and the door yielded. They went in. 
The place stank and was full of filth and disorder: it did not appear to 
have been used for some time. 

'Where is that miserable Lotho hiding?' said Merry. They had searched 
every room and found no living thing save rats and mice. 'Shall we turn on 
the others to search the sheds?' 

'This is worse than Mordor!' said Sam. 'Much worse in a way. It comes 
home to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it 
was all ruined.' 

'Yes, this is Mordor,' said Frodo. 'Just one of its works. Saruman was 
doing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working for 
himself. And the same with those that Saruman tricked, like Lotho.' 

Merry looked round in dismay and disgust. 'Let's get out!' he said. 'If 
I had known all the mischief he had caused, I should have stuffed my pouch 




down Saruman’s throat.' 

'No doubt, no doubt! But you did not, and so I am able to welcome you 
home.' There standing at the door was Saruman himself, looking well-fed and 
well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement. 

A sudden light broke on Frodo. 'Sharkey!' he cried. 

Saruman laughed. 'So you have heard the name, have you? All my people 
used to call me that in Isengard, I believe. A sign of affection, possibly. ( 

But evidently you did not expect to see me here.' 

'I did not,' said Frodo. 'But I might have guessed. A little mischief 
in a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it. 

'Quite capable,' said Saruman, 'and more than a little. You made me 
laugh, you hobbit-lordlings, riding along with all those great people so 
secure and so pleased with your little selves. You thought you had done very 
well out of it all, and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time 
in the country. Saruman's home could be all wrecked, and he could be turned 
out, but no one could touch yours. Oh no! Gandalf would look after your 
affairs.' 

Saruman laughed again. 'Not he! When his tools have done their task he 
drops them. But you must go dangling after him, dawdling and talking, and 
riding round twice as far as you needed. "Well," thought I, "if they're such 
fools, I will get ahead of them and teach them a lesson. One ill turn 
deserves another." It would have been a sharper lesson, if only you had 
given me a little more time and more Men. Still I have already done much 
that you will find it hard to mend or undo in your lives. And it will be 
pleasant to think of that and set it against my injuries.' 

'Well, if that is what you find pleasure in,' said Frodo, 'I pity you. 

It will be a pleasure of memory only, I fear. Go at once and never return!' 

The hobbits of the villages had seen Saruman come out of one of the 
huts, and at once they came crowding up to the door of Bag End. When they 
heard Frodo's command, they murmured angrily: 

'Don't let him go! Kill him! He's a villain and a murderer. Kill him!' 

Saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. 'Kill him!' he 
mocked. 'Kill him, if you think there are enough of you, my brave hobbits!' 
He drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black eyes. 'But do 
not think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my power! Whoever strikes 
me shall be accursed. And if my blood stains the Shire, it shall wither and 
never again be healed.' 




The hobbits recoiled. But Frodo said: 'Do not believe him! He has lost 
all power, save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you, if you 
let it. But I will not have him slain. It is useless to meet revenge with 
revenge: it will heal nothing. Go, Saruman, by the speediest way!' 

'Worm! Worm!' Saruman called; and out of a nearby hut came 
Wormtongue, 

crawling, almost like a dog. To the road again, Worm!' said Saruman. 'These 
fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again. Come along!' 

Saruman turned to go, and Wormtongue shuffled after him. But even as 
Saruman passed close to Frodo a knife flashed in his hand, and he stabbed 
swiftly. The blade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped. A dozen 
hobbits, led by Sam, leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the 
ground. Sam drew his sword. 

'No, Sam!' said Frodo. 'Do not kill him even now. For he has not hurt 
me. And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was 
great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands 
against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but I would still spare 
him, in the hope that he may find it.' 

Saruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo. There was a strange look 
in his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred. 'You have grown, 
Halfling,' he said. 'Yes, you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel. 
You have robbed my revenge of sweetness, and now I must go hence in 
bitterness, in debt to your mercy. I hate it and you! Well, I go and I will 
trouble you no more. But do not expect me to wish you health and long life. 
You will have neither. But that is not my doing. I merely foretell.' 

He walked away, and the hobbits made a lane for him to pass; but their 
knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons. Wormtongue hesitated, 
and then followed his master. 

'Wormtongue!' called Frodo. 'You need not follow him. I know of no evil 
you have done to me. You can have rest and food here for a while, until you 
are stronger and can go your own ways.' 

Wormtongue halted and looked back at him, half prepared to stay. 
Saruman turned. 'No evil?' he cackled. 'Oh no! Even when he sneaks out at 
night it is only to look at the stars. But did I hear someone ask where poor 
Lotho is hiding? You know, don't you, Worm? Will you tell them?' 

Wormtongue cowered down and whimpered: 'No, no!' 

'Then I will,' said Saruman. 'Worm killed your Chief, poor little 




fellow, your nice little Boss. Didn't you, Worm? Stabbed him in his sleep, I 
believe. Buried him, I hope; though Worm has been very hungry lately. No, 
Worm is not really nice. You had better leave him to me.' 

A look of wild hatred came into Wormtongue's red eyes. 'You told me to; 
you made me do it,' he hissed. 

Saruman laughed. 'You do what Sharkey says, always, don't you, Worm? 
Well, now he says: follow!' He kicked Wormtongue in the face as he 
grovelled, and turned and made off. But at that something snapped: suddenly 
Wormtongue rose up, drawing a hidden knife, and then with a snarl like a dog 
he sprang on Saruman's back, jerked his head back, cut his throat, and with 
a yell ran off down the lane. Before Frodo could recover or speak a word, 
three hobbit-bows twanged and Wormtongue fell dead. 

To the dismay of those that stood by, about the body of Saruman a grey 
mist gathered, and rising slowly to a great height like smoke from a fire, 
as a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the Hill. For a moment it wavered, 
looking to the West; but out of the West came a cold wind, and it bent away, 
and with a sigh dissolved into nothing. 

Frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it 
seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, 
and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. Lifting up 
the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it, he covered it over, 
and turned away. 

'And that's the end of that,' said Sam. 'A nasty end, and I wish I 
needn't have seen it; but it's a good riddance.' 

'And the very last end of the War, I hope,' said Merry. 

'I hope so,' said Frodo and sighed. 'The very last stroke. But to think 
that it should fall here, at the very door of Bag End! Among all my hopes 
and fears at least I never expected that.' 

'I shan't call it the end, till we've cleared up the mess,' said Sam 
gloomily. 'And that'll take a lot of time and work.' 




Chapter 9 . The Grey Havens 



The clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time 
than Sam had feared. The day after the battle Frodo rode to Michel Delving 
and released the prisoners from the Lockholes. One of the first that they 
found was poor Fredegar Bolger, Fatty no longer. He had been taken when the 
ruffians smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in 
the Brockenbores by the hills of Scary. 

'You would have done better to come with us after all, poor old 
Fredegar!' said Pippin, as they carried him out too weak to walk. 

He opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile. 'Who's this young giant 
with the loud voice?' he whispered. 'Not little Pippin! What's your size in 
hats now?' 

Then there was Lobelia. Poor thing, she looked very old and thin when 
they rescued her from a dark and narrow cell. She insisted on hobbling out 
on her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and there was such clapping and 
cheering when she appeared, leaning on Frodo's arm but still clutching her 
umbrella, that she was quite touched, and drove away in tears. She had never 
in her life been popular before. But she was crushed by the news of Lotho's 
murder, and she would' not return to Bag End. She gave it back to Frodo, and 
went to her own people, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle. 

When the poor creature died next Spring-she was after all more than a 
hundred years old - Frodo was surprised and much moved: she had left all 
that remained of her money and of Lotho's for him to use in helping hobbits 
made homeless by the troubles. So that feud was ended. 

Old Will Whitfoot had been in the Lockholes longer than any, and though 
he had perhaps been treated less harshly than some, he needed a lot of 
feeding up before he could look the part of Mayor; so Frodo agreed to act as 
his Deputy, until Mr. Whitfoot was in shape again. The only thing that he 
did as Deputy Mayor was to reduce the Shirriffs to their proper functions 
and numbers. The task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was 
left to Merry and Pippin, and it was soon done. The southern gangs, after 
hearing the news of the Battle of By water, fled out of the land and offered 
little resistance to the Thain. Before the Year's End the few survivors were 
rounded up in the woods, and those that surrendered were shown to the 




borders. 

Meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace, and Sam was kept very 
busy. Hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on 
them. 

Now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages, from the small but 
nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of 
the gaffers and gammers. Before Yule not a brick was left standing of the 
new Shirriff-houses or of anything that had been built by 'Sharkey's Men'; 
but the bricks were used to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger and 
drier. Great stores of goods and food, and beer, were found that had been 
hidden away by the ruffians in sheds and barns and deserted holes, and 
especially in the tunnels at Michel Delving and in the old quarries at 
Scary; so that there was a great deal better cheer that Yule than anyone had 
hoped for. 

One of the first things done in Hobbiton, before even the removal of 
the new mill, was the clearing of the Hill and Bag End, and the restoration 
of Bagshot Row. The front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into 
a large sheltered garden, and new holes were dug in the southward face, back 
into the Hill, and they were lined with brick. The Gaffer was restored to 
Number Three; and he said often and did not care who heard it: 

'It's an ill wind as blows nobody no good, as I always say. And All's 
well as ends Better!' 

There was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given. 
Battle Gardens was thought of, or Better Smials. But after a while in 
sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called New Row. It was a purely Bywater 
joke to refer to it as Sharkey's End. 

The trees were the worst loss and damage, for at Sharkey's bidding they 
had been cut down recklessly far and wide over the Shire; and Sam grieved 
over this more than anything else. For one thing, this hurt would take long 
to heal, and only his great-grandchildren, he thought, would see the Shire 
as it ought to be. 

Then suddenly one day, for he had been too busy for weeks to give a 
thought to his adventures, he remembered the gift of Galadriel. He brought 
the box out and showed it to the other Travellers (for so they were now 
called by everyone), and asked their advice. 

'I wondered when you would think of it,' said Frodo. 'Open it!' 

Inside it was filled with a grey dust, soft and fine, in the middle of 




which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shale. ’What can I do with 
this?' said Sam. 

'Throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work!' said 
Pippin. 

'On what?' said Sam. 

'Choose one spot as a nursery, and see what happens to the plants 
there,' said Merry. 

'But I'm sure the Lady would not like me to keep it all for my own 
garden, now so many folk have suffered,' said Sam. 

'Use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, Sam,' said Frodo, 
'and then use the gift to help your work and better it. And use it 
sparingly. There is not much here, and I expect every grain has a value.' 

So Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or 
beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in 
the soil at the root of each. He went up and down the Shire in this labour; 
but if he paid special attention to Hobbiton and By water no one blamed him. 
And at the end he found that he still had a little of the dust left; so he 
went to the Three-Farthing Stone, which is as near the centre of the Shire 
as no matter, and cast it in the air with his blessing. The little silver 
nut he planted in the Party Field where the tree had once been; and he 
wondered what would come of it. All through the winter he remained as 
patient as he could, and tried to restrain himself from going round 
constantly to see if anything was happening. 

Spring surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and grow, 
as if time was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty. In the 
Party Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had silver bark and long 
leaves and burst into golden flowers in April. It was indeed a mallorn, and 
it was the wonder of the neighbourhood. In after years, as it grew in grace 
and beauty, it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys 
to 

see it: the only mallorn west of the Mountains and east of the Sea, and one 
of the finest in the world. 

Altogether 1420 in the Shire was a marvellous year. Not only was there 
wonderful sunshine and delicious rain, in due times and perfect measure, but 
there seemed something more: an air of richness and growth, and a gleam of a 
beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this 
Middle -earth. All the children born or begotten in that year, and there were 




many, were fair to see and strong, and most of them had a rich golden hair 
that had before been rare among hobbits. The fruit was so plentiful that 
young hobbits very nearly bathed in strawberries and cream; and later they 
sat on the lawns under the plum-trees and ate, until they had made piles of 
stones like small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror, and then 
they moved on. And no one was ill, and everyone was pleased, except those 
who had to mow the grass. 

In the Southfarthing the vines were laden, and the yield of 'leaf was 
astonishing; and everywhere there was so much corn that at Harvest every 
barn was stuffed. 'The Northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of 
1420 malt was long remembered and became a byword. Indeed a generation 
later 

one might hear an old gaffer in an inn, after a good pint of well-earned 
ale, put down his mug with a sigh: 'Ah! that was proper fourteen-twenty, 
that was!' 

Sam stayed at first at the Cottons' with Frodo; but when the New Row 
was ready he went with the Gaffer. In addition to all his other labours he 
was busy directing the cleaning up and restoring of Bag End; but he was 
often away in the Shire on his forestry work. So he was not at home in early 
March and did not know that Frodo had been ill. On the thirteenth of that 
month Farmer Cotton found Frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white 
gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream. 

'It is gone for ever,' he said, 'and now all is dark and empty.' 

But the fit passed, and when Sam got back on the twenty -fifth, Frodo 
had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. In the meanwhile Bag End 
had been set in order, and Merry and Pippin came over from Crickhollow 
bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon 
looked very much as it always had done. 

When all was at last ready Frodo said: 'When are you going to move in 
and join me, Sam?' 

Sam looked a bit awkward. 

'There is no need to come yet, if you don't want to,' said Frodo. 'But 
you know the Gaffer is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after 
by Widow Rumble.' 

It s not that, Mr. Frodo, said Sam, and he went ver red. 

'Well, what is it?' 

'It's Rosie, Rose Cotton,' said Sam. 'It seems she didn't like my going 




abroad at all, poor lass; but as I hadn't spoken, she couldn’t say so. And I 
didn't speak, because I had a job to do first. But now I have spoken, and 
she says: "Well, you've wasted a year, so why wait longer?" "Wasted?" I 
says. "I wouldn't call it that." Still I see what she means. I feel torn in 
two, as you might say.' 

'I see,' said Frodo: 'you want to get married, and yet you want to live 
with me in Bag End too? But my dear Sam, how easy! Get married as soon as 
you can, and then move in with Rosie. There's room enough in Bag End for as 
big a family as you could wish for.' 

And so it was settled. Sam Gamgee married Rose Cotton in the Spring of 
1420 (which was also famous for its weddings), and they came and lived at 
Bag End. And if Sam thought himself lucky, Frodo knew that he was more 
lucky 

himself; for there was not a hobbit in the Shire that was looked after with 
such care. When the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he 
took to a quiet life, writing a great deal and going through all his notes. 

Ele resigned the office of Deputy Mayor at the Free Fair that mid-summer, and 
dear old Will Whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at Banquets. 

Merry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow, and there 
was much coming and going between Buckland and Bag End. The two 
young 

Travellers cut a great dash in the Shire with their songs and their tales 
and their finery, and their wonderful parties. 'Lordly' folk called them, 
meaning nothing but good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by 
with their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and 
singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent, they 
were unchanged otherwise, unless they were indeed more fairspoken and 
more 

jovial and full of merriment than ever before. 

Frodo and Sam, however, went back to ordinary attire, except that when 
there was need they both wore long grey cloaks, finely woven and clasped at 
the throat with beautiful brooches; and Mr. Frodo wore always a white jewel 
on a chain that he often would finger. 

All things now went well, with hope always of becoming still better; 
and Sam was as busy and as full of delight as even a hobbit could wish. 
Nothing for him marred that whole year, except for some vague anxiety about 
his master. Frodo dropped quietly out of all the doings of the Shire, and 




Sam was pained to notice how little honour he had in his own country. Few 
people knew or wanted to know about his deeds and adventures; their 
admiration and respect were given mostly to Mr. Meriadoc and Mr. Peregrin 
and (if Sam had known it) to himself. Also in the autumn there appeared a 
shadow of old troubles. 

One evening Sam came into the study and found his master looking very 
strange. He was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away. 

’What's the matter, Mr. Frodo?' said Sam. 

'I am wounded,' he answered, 'wounded; it will never really heal.' 

But then he got up, and the turn seemed to pass, and he was quite 
himself the next day. It was not until afterwards that Sam recalled that the 
date was October the sixth. Two years before on that day it was dark in the 
dell under Weathertop. 

Time went on, and 1421 came in. Frodo was ill again in March, but with 
a great effort he concealed it, for Sam had other things to think about. The 
first of Sam and Rosie's children was born on the twenty-fifth of March, a 
date that Sam noted. 

'Well, Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'I'm in a bit of a fix. Rose and me had 
settled to call him Frodo, with your leave; but it's not him, it's her. 

Though as pretty a maidchild as any one could hope for, taking after Rose 
more than me, luckily. So we don't know what to do.' 

'Well, Sam,' said Frodo, 'what's wrong with the old customs? Choose a 
flower name like Rose. Half the maidchildren in the Shire are called by such 
names, and what could be better?' 

'I suppose you're right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'I've heard some 
beautiful names on my travels, but I suppose they're a bit too grand for 
daily wear and tear, as you might say. The Gaffer, he says: "Make it short, 
and then you won't have to cut it short before you can use it." But if it's 
to be a flower-name, then I don't trouble about the length: it must be a 
beautiful flower, because, you see, I think she is very beautiful, and is 
going to be beautifuller still.' 

Frodo thought for a moment. 'Well, Sam, what about elanor, the 
sun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of Lothlurien?' 

'You're right again, Mr. Frodo!' said Sam delighted. 'That's what I 
wanted.' 

Little Elanor was nearly six months old, and 1421 had passed to its 
autumn, when Frodo called Sam into the study. 




'It will be Bilbo's Birthday on Thursday, Sam,' he said. 'And he will 
pass the Old Took. He will be a hundred and thirty-one!' 

'So he will!' said Sam. 'He's a marvel!' 

'Well, Sam,' said Frodo. 'I want you to see Rose and find out if she 
can spare you, so that you and I can go off together. You can't go far or 
for a long time now, of course,' he said a little wistfully. 

'Well, not very well, Mr. Frodo.' 

'Of course not. But never mind. You can see me on my way. Tell Rose 
that you won't be away very long, not more than a fortnight; and you'll come 
back quite safe.' 

'I wish I could go all the way with you to Rivendell, Mr. Frodo, and 
see Mr. Bilbo,' said Sam. 'And yet the only place I really want to be in is 
here. I am that torn in two.' 

'Poor Sam! It will feel like that, I am afraid,' said Frodo. 'But you 
will be healed. You were meant to be solid and whole, and you will be.' 

In the next day or two Frodo went through his papers and his writings 
with Sam, and he handed over his keys. There was a big book with plain red 
leather covers; its tall pages were now almost filled. At the beginning 
there were many leaves covered with Bilbo's thin wandering hand; but most of 
it was written in Frodo's firm flowing script. It was divided into chapters 
but Chapter 80 was unfinished, and after that were some blank leaves. The 
title page had many titles on it, crossed out one after another, so: 

My Diary. My Unexpected Journey. There and Back Again. And What 
Happened After. 

Adventures of Five Hobbits. The Tale of the Great Ring, compiled by 
Bilbo Baggins from his own observations and the accounts of his friends . 
What we did in the War of the Ring. 

Here Bilbo's hand ended and Frodo had written: 

THE DOWNFALL 

OF THE 

LORD OF THE RINGS 

AND THE 

RETURN OF THE KING 



(as seen by the Little People; being the memoirs of Bilbo and Frodo of 




the Shire, supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of 
the Wise.) 

Together with extracts from Books of Lore translated by Bilbo in 
Rivendell. 

'Why, you have nearly finished it, Mr. Frodo!' Sam exclaimed. 'Well, 
you have kept at it, I must say.' 

'I have quite finished, Sam,' said Frodo. 'The last pages are for you.' 

On September the twenty-first they set out together, Frodo on the pony 
that had borne him all the way from Minas Tirith, and was now called 
Strider; and Sam on his beloved Bill. It was a fair golden morning, and Sam 
did not ask where they were going: he thought he could guess. 

They took the Stock Road over the hills and went towards the Woody End, 
and they let their ponies walk at their leisure. They camped in the Green 
Hills, and on September the twenty-second they rode gently down into the 
beginning of the trees as afternoon was wearing away. 

'If that isn't the very tree you hid behind when the Black Rider first 
showed up, Mr. Frodo!' said Sam pointing to the left. 'It seems like a dream 
now.' 

It was evening, and the stars were glimmering in the eastern sky as 
they passed the ruined oak and turned and went on down the hill between the 
hazel -thickets. Sam was silent, deep in his memories. Presently he became 
aware that Frodo was singing softly to himself, singing the old 
walking-song, but the words were not quite the same. 

Still round the corner there may wait 
Anew road or a secret gate; 

And though I oft have passed them by, 

A day will come at last when I 
Shall take the hidden paths that run 
West of the Moon, East of the Sun. 

And as if in answer, from down below, coming up the road out of the 
valley, voices sang: 

A! Elbereth Gilthoniel! 
silivren penna mnriel 
o menel aglar elenath, 

Gilthoniel, A! Elbereth! 

We still remember, we who dwell 
In this far land beneath the trees 




The starlight on the Western Seas. 

Frodo and Sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows, until they saw 
a shimmer as the travellers came towards them. 

There was Gildor and many fair Elven folk; and there to Sam's wonder 
rode Elrond and Galadriel. Elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon 
his forehead, and a silver harp was in his hand, and upon his finger was a 
ring of gold with a great blue stone, Vilya, mightiest of the Three. But 
Galadriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed all in glimmering white, 
like clouds about the Moon; for she herself seemed to shine with a soft 
light. On her finger was Nenya, the ring wrought of mithril, that bore a 
single white stone flickering like a frosty star. Riding slowly behind on a 
small grey pony, and seeming to nod in his sleep, was Bilbo himself. 

Elrond greeted them gravely and graciously, and Galadriel smiled upon 
them. 'Well, Master Samwise,' she said. 'I hear and see that you have used 
my gift well. The Shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved.' 
Sam bowed, but found nothing to say. Ele had forgotten how beautiful the Lady 
was. 

Then Bilbo woke up and opened his eyes. 'Hullo, Frodo!' he said. 'Well, 

I have passed the Old Took today! So that's settled. And now I think I am 
quite ready to go on another journey. Are you coming?' 

'Yes, I am coming,' said Frodo. 'The Ring -bearers should go together.' 

'Where are you going, Master?' cried Sam, though at last he understood 
what was happening. 

'To the Havens, Sam,' said Frodo. 

'And I can't come.' 

'No, Sam. Not yet anyway, not further than the Havens. Though you too 
were a Ring -bearer, if only for a little while. Your time may come. Do not 
be too sad, Sam. You cannot be always torn in two. You will have to be one 
and whole, for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.' 

'But,' said Sam, and tears started in his eyes, 'I thought you were 
going to enjoy the Shire, too. for years and years, after all you have 
done.' 

'So I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried 
to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be 
so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, 
so that others may keep them. But you are my heir: all that I had and might 
have had I leave to you. And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad 




will come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and 
perhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed 
everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and 
the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red 
Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone, so that people will 
remember the Great Danger and so love their beloved land all the more. And 
that will keep you as busy and as happy as anyone can be, as long as your 
part of the Story goes on. 

'Come now, ride with me!' 

Then Elrond and Galadriel rode on; for the Third Age was over, and the 
Days of the Rings were passed, and an end was come of the story and song of 
those times. With them went many Elves of the High Kindred who would 
no 

longer stay in Middle-earth; and among them, filled with a sadness that was 
yet blessed and without bitterness, rode Sam, and Frodo, and Bilbo, and the 
Elves delighted to honour them. 

Though they rode through the midst of the Shire all the evening and all 
the night, none saw them pass, save the wild creatures; or here and there 
some wanderer in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the trees, or a 
light and shadow flowing through the grass as the Moon went westward. And 
when they had passed from the Shire, going about the south skirts of the 
White Downs, they came to the Far Downs, and to the Towers, and looked on 
the distant Sea; and so they rode down at last to Mithlond, to the Grey 
Havens in the long firth of Lune. 

As they came to the gates Cnrdan the Shipwright came forth to greet 
them. Very tall he was, and his beard was long, and he was grey and old, 
save that his eyes were keen as stars; and he looked at them and bowed, and 
said: ’All is now ready.' 

Then Cnrdan led them to the Havens, and there was a white ship lying, 
and upon the quay beside a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in 
white awaiting them. As he turned and came towards them Frodo saw that 
Gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the Third Ring, Nary a the Great, and 
the stone upon it was red as fire. Then those who were to go were glad, for 
they knew that Gandalf also would take ship with them. 

But Sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the 
parting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long road home 
alone. But even as they stood there, and the Elves were going aboard, and 




all was being made ready to depart, up rode Merry and Pippin in great haste. 
And amid his tears Pippin laughed. 

'You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo.' he said. 

This time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again. It was not 
Sam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf himself!' 

'Yes,' said Gandalf; 'for it will be better to ride back three together 
'than one alone. Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea 
comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace! I will not 
say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.' 

Then Frodo kissed Merry and Pippin, and last of all Sam, and went 
aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship 
slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of 
Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into 
the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain 
Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing 
that came over the water. And then it seemed to him that as in his dream in 
the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and 
was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green 
country under a swift sunrise. 

But to Sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the Haven; 
and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was 
soon lost in the West. There still he stood far into the night, hearing only 
the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of Middle-earth, and the 
sound of them sank deep into his heart. Beside him stood Merry and Pippin, 
and they were silent. 

At last the three companions turned away, and never again looking back 
they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to one another until they 
came back to the Shire, but each had great comfort in his friends on the 
long grey road. 

At last they rode over the downs and took the East Road, and then Merry 
and Pippin rode on to Buckland; and already they were singing again as they 
went. But Sam turned to Bywater, and so came back up the Hill, as day was 
ending once more. And he went on, and there was yellow light, and fire 
within; and the evening meal was ready, and he was expected. And Rose drew 
him in, and set him in his chair, and put little Elanor upon his lap. 

He drew a deep breath. 'Well, I'm back,' he said.
