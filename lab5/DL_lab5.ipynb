of DNNs by implementing the style transfer algorithm.\n","To understand the importance of a complex loss function.\n","To see how we can optimize not only over network parameters,\n","but over other objects (such as images) as well.\n","\n","## Deliverable\n","For this lab, you will need to implement the style transfer algorithm of Gatys et al.\n","\n","* You must extract statistics from the content and style images\n","* You must formulate an optimization problem over an input image\n","* You must optimize the image to match both style and content\n","\n","In your jupyter notebook, you should turn in the following:\n","\n","* The final image that you generated\n","* Your code\n","\n","An example image that I generated is shown below\n","\n","![](http://liftothers.org/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=300&tok=179805&media=cs501r_f2016:style1.png)\n","\n","## Grading standards\n","Your code will be graded on the following:\n","\n","* 35% Correct extraction of statistics\n","* 45% Correct construction of loss function in a loss class\n","* 10% Correct initialization and optimization of image variable in a dataset class\n","* 10% Awesome looking final image\n","\n","## Description:\n","\n","For this lab, you should implement the style transfer algorithm referenced above.\n","To do this, you will need to unpack the given images.\n","Since we want you to focus on implementing the paper and the loss function, \n","we will give you the code for this."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"VdQhJmJJYOt_","colab":{}},"source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","import
