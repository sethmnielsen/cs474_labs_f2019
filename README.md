# Deep Learning

Deep learning labs for BYU's CS 474 class

I recommend using Colab for coding most of the labs. However, you might find it useful to do small experiments on your computer, where it is easier to save interim results or just for quick prototyping. In that case I recommend using PyCharm as
it is a fully featured Python IDE with Jupyter notebook support built in and nice debugging features, and is free for students. Of course you are free to use whatever editor you choose, but don't expect us to debug your editor's issues.

The .ipynb files are in the jupyter notebook format that Colab and PyCharm uses.

Each file has an 'Open in Colab' link at the top of the file, 
so you can navigate directly to a Colab instance from Github.

If you can't see the .ipynb file previews, try entering the github url of the file at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
